Just promise you'll do better next time. Start with your unruly inner child, because the next thing you know, you'll have an aggressive or uptight adult living in your head, and there goes your sense of wonder. There's a better strategy. Forget this day altogether. Muddle through it the best you can, then turn the page and start over.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
