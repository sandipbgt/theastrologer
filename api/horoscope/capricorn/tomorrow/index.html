    "horoscope": "You're in a good mood today, and your goodwill is shining out to others. They can tell you're honest and trustworthy, and that counts for a lot now. If an issue comes up that needs sound judgment and a level head, you're a good person to rise to the occasion. You're certain of your own principles, which helps you make decisions you won't regret later on. Be open to amending your ideas, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
