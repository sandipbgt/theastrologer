    "horoscope": "Whether it's about business expertise or life experience, you're speaking as a seasoned old pro. You know what you're saying, and you can say it with relaxed honesty. You've been there and done that, so you have a pretty good idea of what will happen next, too. The world will see you as capable and authoritative today. You'll get some kind of leverage out of this, because it's what you've been aiming for all these years. And a little respect goes a long way, doesn't it?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
