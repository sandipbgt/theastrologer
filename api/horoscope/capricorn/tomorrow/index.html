    "horoscope": "Seek balance today in all you do. That means don't work for too many hours, or relax for too long, either. Don't insist on your own point of view, or always concede to the person whose opinion is the strongest. Spend time with friends or family, but get some alone time, too. Keeping this balance of give and take is important now, and it's the key to staying on an even keel.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
