    "horoscope": "A frivolous mood could overtake you today. You're feeling unusually scattered, almost giddy. Flirting with someone cute or trading friendly barbs with a pal or coworker might seem like harmless fun, and it is as it doesn't break your focus. Whatever you're working on still demands your attention. Remember that any thoughtless moves today could lead to harsh consequences tomorrow, so stay responsible. Later, you'll be very glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
