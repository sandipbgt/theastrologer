    "horoscope": "There are few who can compete with you when it comes to worldly success, whether that occurs in the office, the gym or some other forum. You like healthy competition wherever you can find it, but outfoxing the enemy can be a hollow victory if the enemy isn't smart enough to begin with. You crave real challenge to stir your emotions. Try to expand your range today. The world is not against you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
