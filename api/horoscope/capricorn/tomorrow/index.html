    "horoscope": "There's an impending project weighing on your mind, and you know you've got some serious decisions to make, soon. But so far, you feel indecisive. It's hard to separate what you want from what you really need. Instead of forcing a decision, relax. Talk to a friend or a colleague and ask for their objective opinion. Most of all, give yourself time to sort this all out. The truth will come to you, soon. There's no need to force it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
