    "horoscope": "Hard work is like play for you, and now you possess even more drive than usual.  Stick to the plan, because you'll make great headway today, but have a care for the people around you. Your coworkers might have some good ideas that will make your project even more successful. But even if they don't have anything of substance to add, don't treat them as obstacles or speed bumps. Drive isn't everything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
