    "horoscope": "In some strange way, you're open to thought streams that are usually closed off. It's not coming from your head, either, but your heart or some other realm. In this glimpse of unity, you experience something fleeting and strange. Momentary zeal fuses with your usual long-term ambition. You sense the time is not yet right to act on this vision, but do what you can anyway. Let it inspire your day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
