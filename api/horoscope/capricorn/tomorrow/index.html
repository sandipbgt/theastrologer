These are the folks who make live worth living, after all -- the people for whom you work so hard. They need some attention! Check in with them and let them know how much you care about them. Yes, they should already know, and they probably do. But there's nothing wrong with restating it for the record.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
