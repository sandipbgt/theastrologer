    "horoscope": "Your theme for today should be 'outside the box.' Take an innovative approach to a task at work. And if you normally sit in a cubicle, by all means, get out of that little box! You can even apply this to mundane activities like running errands or folding laundry. Challenge yourself to do things a bit differently from the way you normally do them. Find a new system that works better than the old one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
