    "horoscope": "Other people's emotional displays seem especially dramatic today. They're behaving irrationally, and you can see right through their tactics, such as tantrums, the cold shoulder, jealousy, martyrdom and more. But try not to be too judgmental of their behavior. Withdrawing emotionally isn't a good idea now, either. It's okay to get worked up about things sometimes, you know. Processing your feelings helps you move past them. Maybe this is necessary now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
