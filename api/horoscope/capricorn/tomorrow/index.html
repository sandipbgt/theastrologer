    "horoscope": "Your energy and focus are scattered today, and work -- ordinarily your trusty refuge -- only brings frustration. Don't drive yourself crazy by trying ever harder to buckle down. Instead, call a spade a spade, and take a break. An hour of solitude in a coffee shop will do you good. A chat with a friend you've been neglecting could make you feel even better. You don't have to stick to your schedule. Deviating from the plan might actually be very smart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
