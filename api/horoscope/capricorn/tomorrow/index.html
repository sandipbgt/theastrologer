    "horoscope": "Your emotional weather report calls for some turbulence today. Abandonment issues are triggered by some minor slight. Maybe another person's take on an old event will betray your carefully selected memories of it. Clumsy efforts might interfere with smooth transitions. You'll probably worry about everything, because that's how you get sometimes, and anxiety might start to unravel the basic fabric of your security. Uh-oh. Try to minimize the damage sooner, not later. If you wait too long, there's no telling what else could get tangled up in all this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
