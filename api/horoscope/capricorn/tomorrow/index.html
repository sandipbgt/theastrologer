New ideas are occurring to you, and they're pretty good. You think you might be able to do something with them -- once you put them through a little more testing, and make sure they're viable. Focus today on listening and absorbing the things you hear and experience.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
