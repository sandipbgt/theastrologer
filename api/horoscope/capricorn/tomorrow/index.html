    "horoscope": "You're a modern thinker now, and as always, a systematic doer. Today offers you a chance at a dry run on whatever you've got in the works. So take this opportunity for what it's worth. You can make progress on existing business by feeling out clients' or colleagues' responses to your project. Soon, you'll know whether your results are worth publishing. If so, they'll be yet another entry on your lengthy list of accomplishments. If not, it's no problem: You'll have gained valuable information that you can use next time to make your work a real success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
