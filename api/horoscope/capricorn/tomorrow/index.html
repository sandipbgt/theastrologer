    "horoscope": "Jealousy is a natural response when you feel that someone else has gotten something you wanted for yourself. Today, you might feel cheated out of that raise or promotion or happy relationship -- the one you feel so strongly that you deserve. And now it seems even further out of reach than ever. But don't be upset about it. Be gracious about your friend's or coworker's success. Your time will come soon enough, and you can bank on that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
