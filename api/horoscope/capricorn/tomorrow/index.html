    "horoscope": "With the truth so soft and reality so conditional, it seems like everyone's in politics these days. Yes, people can be disappointing, but don't blame them for flip-flopping. So what if they're suddenly on a different course? You change your mind a lot, too, you know. Whining will fall on deaf ears today. Finger pointing will only call attention to your own hands, which might not be as clean as you'd like to believe. Stop making a fuss and start making yourself useful. Change the system from within. Lead by example.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
