    "horoscope": "You feel strongly connected to your own family today, or perhaps you're identifying more closely than usual with your spiritual or cultural background. It's a good thing to feel close with the people and places you came from. After all, these influences are the ones that made you who you are. Just avoid being closed-minded when you encounter someone who's different from you. Stay open, interested and accepting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
