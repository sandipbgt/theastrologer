    "horoscope": "Today, life seems a little bit lovelier and more beautiful than usual. The way the morning sunlight shines in your bedroom window might really touch you. Or perhaps you'll be deeply moved by a story you see on the news of someone's struggle, or a piece of artwork you spot in a shop window. Your soul is open to revelation. You want to feel moved, and you probably will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
