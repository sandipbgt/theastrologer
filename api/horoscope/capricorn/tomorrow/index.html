    "horoscope": "If you notice yourself feeling a bit moody, vulnerable or tense today, take it as a sign that it's time to reconnect with your base. This means setting work concerns aside and spending time at home, with loved ones or on your own. Your focus should be on nurturing yourself with good food and relaxation. Any stress you're feeling will melt away as you get centered and boost your own sense of well-being.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
