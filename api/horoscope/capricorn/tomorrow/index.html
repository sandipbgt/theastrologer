    "horoscope": "Today you're at your calm, rational and hardworking best. You're receiving a boost direct from the cosmos, and it's helping you stay extra disciplined. Putting in long hours at the office? Or trying to finish a complex project at home? You have the determination needed to see it through to the end. Just try not to wear yourself out unnecessarily!
