    "horoscope": "Constructive philanthropy: That should be your theme of the day. Lend your grounded perspective to a friend who's feeling confused or depressed. Your solid strength can help them feel more secure. And take at least a few moments today to make an affectionate connection with your partner, children or someone else you care about. It's a good day for reveling in your most positive emotions and relationships.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
