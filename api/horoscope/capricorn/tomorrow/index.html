    "horoscope": "Look up from your book or computer screen and visualize something in a new, enlightened way. Notice how your priorities are shifting and swirling, becoming less material and more soulful. Follow this imaginative train of thought where it leads you. Let yourself be lifted by sublime music. Take a nature walk or dance to a soulful beat. Do something that doesn't involve your intellect, for once. Connect with the divine. That's who you truly are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
