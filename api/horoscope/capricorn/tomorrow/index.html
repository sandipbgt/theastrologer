    "horoscope": "It's hard not to feel emotionally vulnerable today. Suddenly, you're extra aware of how precious your loved ones are, and how lucky you are to live such a comfortable, secure existence. And with that awareness comes the twin awareness that these blessings aren't permanent. Don't let that thought scare you,. This is about learning to live in the moment, and being grateful for what you have and hold now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
