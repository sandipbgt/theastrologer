    "horoscope": "Deep-rooted worries come into play today. When you feel insecure, you might respond by strengthening the external structures of your life -- your financial profile, for example, or your career or home-buying plan. But while those are all good ways to create long-term security, they probably don't address the heart of the issue, which is emotional in nature. You would be better off facing your anxieties or sharing them with a friend.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
