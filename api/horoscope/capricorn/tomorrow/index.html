    "horoscope": "It's hard moving through the world with ease when you're worried what other people think. Your normal stride turns into a defensive swagger as you try to pretend you're strong, secure and admirable. But no one's taken in by arrogance, and prickly behavior won't make you any allies. There's got to be a better way to show your strength,, because you are strong. You're powerful and smart and capable, just like you want people to believe. Maybe you should start believing in yourself, again. Then what others think won't even matter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
