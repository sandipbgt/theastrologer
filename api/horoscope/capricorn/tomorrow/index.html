    "horoscope": "Any projects you have on your plate today should proceed smoothly. You're a master of common sense and lord over your own ego. You'll bring experience to the table and set strategies that benefit everyone, not just you. That's good, because this is no time to be selfish. If you chance upon a golden opportunity at work, team up so you can all reap the benefits. You'll find that plenty of doors swing open for you now, and you can afford to be gracious. Hold the door for someone else to pass through, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
