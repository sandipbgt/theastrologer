    "horoscope": "Loosen up today. Make warm connections with people whose company you enjoy, instead of feeling uptight or following the demands of your ego. In that spirit, don't compare your own accomplishments against someone else's. Throw out the fame scale. Forget about what other people think of you. Your true friends love you regardless of your supposed qualifications for deserving their affection. Relax and connect with them today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
