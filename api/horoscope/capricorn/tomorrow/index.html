    "horoscope": "Do your best to be diplomatic today as you interact with other people. If you push too hard for your own goals, others may start to think you aren't interested in compromise. And in your heart of hearts, you may not be. But getting along with others and finding common ground are most important today. Anything less comes too close to selfishness. Work for the good of the group.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
