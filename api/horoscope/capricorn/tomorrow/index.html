Your determination is strong, and the more challenging a problem or situation is, the more committed you are to resolving it. If other people, such as your employer, see you in motion today, they're sure to be impressed. But even more importantly, you'll gain the benefit of proving to yourself that you can accomplish anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
