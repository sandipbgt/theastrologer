And be sure to seek common ground, even if you truly believe you're in the right and your opponent is not. Surely you share some objective or perspective in common. Find it, and use it as a seed for creating a mutually satisfying, balanced resolution. Both sides should be able to reach an agreement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
