Complete what you began, and lock it down so it'll stay completed. This hands-on method is still the easiest way to learn. The muscle memory of easy, natural rhythms will be with you for a good long time. Practice is important, too. Get into the habit of reviewing whatever you learn. Check out the extra threads and footnotes. You can always go deeper, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
