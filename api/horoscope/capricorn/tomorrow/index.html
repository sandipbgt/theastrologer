    "horoscope": "The perfect comeback is probably dancing on the tip of your tongue right now. But unless you're working a comedy club or hanging with thick-skinned friends, speak kindly whatever your emotions say. Be a good judge of character among strangers, even if they assure you that all is cool. That'll mean being patient with them and not giving them any reason to be annoyed with you. Show up on time, keep a low profile and politely refuse invitations that might stir up trouble. Within just one day you'll start seeing the benefits from all this excellent self-control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
