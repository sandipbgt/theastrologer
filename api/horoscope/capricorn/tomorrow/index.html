    "horoscope": "Today it's easy to be sensitive to other people's feelings. Often you're more focused on practical concerns than on matters of the heart. But now you're tuned in at that emotional level. You're reading people well, seeing them as full, feeling beings. This puts you in a great position to help someone manage a problem or talk out an issue. You can offer your strong support and give excellent, practical advice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
