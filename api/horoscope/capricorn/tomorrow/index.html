    "horoscope": "You're attuned to reality today -- the actual problems and projects before you, and the resources you can draw from as you work through them. Your outlook is so sensible that you may spend part of your day troubleshooting other people's projects or giving out advice. You don't mind. You want to help anyone who wants to help themselves become more skilled. This is part of giving back to the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
