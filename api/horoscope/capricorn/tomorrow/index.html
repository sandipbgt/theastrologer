    "horoscope": "You respect the rules, regulations and routines that keep your life moving smoothly forward. That's just practical. But today's energy encourages you to break out of those bounds. Find a new neighborhood to explore on foot, or try a new restaurant. Talk to a stranger -- someone you've been wondering about at work, or someone you encounter while you're out and about. Open your eyes to the freshness of the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
