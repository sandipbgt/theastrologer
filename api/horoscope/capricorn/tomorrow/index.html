But while self-discipline is good, you need to make time to relax, too. And who deserves it more than you? It's your turn to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Today is a great time to spend a bit of your hard-earned cash on something frivolous. Tomorrow will be back to the coal mine!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
