    "horoscope": "You're thinking about yourself and your life a lot today -- the projects on your table, whether they're fresh or outmoded, and your direction in the immediate future as well as in the long term. Are you on the right path? Question your inner authority, but not in a rebellious way. Be sincere and you'll get an honest answer, which will determine your choices and behavior. It's all about integrity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
