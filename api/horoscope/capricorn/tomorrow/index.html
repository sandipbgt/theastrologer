    "horoscope": "You're always hard at work on your own endeavors, pushing toward your own goals. But while focusing on your future is always a good idea, it's also smart to spend some time focusing on other people, too. Maybe a friend needs some help today with building something or solving a personal problem. You're good at both physical work and emotional advice, and lending a hand will make you feel great.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
