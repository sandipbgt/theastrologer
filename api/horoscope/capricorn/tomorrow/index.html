You keep saying everything's 'just fine' as you drive, white-knuckled, down the road of life. Why are you keeping such an iron grip on your reality? Dare yourself to take a deep breath. You won't crack your armor or drown. Give yourself permission to blink. There's no laughter or lost business, is there? Shift position. Unwind. Things will get better. Hey, maybe things already are better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
