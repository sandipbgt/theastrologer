    "horoscope": "Are you feeling like a different person today? You're confident and a little goofy, and that's not like you at all. You could feel a little scattered, but enjoy yourself! Just don't look down on anyone who seems too serious,-- someone has to work while you're playing. Plenty of times, it's been you on the opposite end, putting in extra work because someone else is slacking off. Think of this short period as your time to balance things out. When your focus returns, then you can get back to work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
