If other people get a little too novel in their ideas, you're able to rein them in and get everyone back on track. You're focused on systems and structures with long-term viability, and that's an important perspective to bring to the table. Be sure to pat yourself on the back at the end of the day, for a job well done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
