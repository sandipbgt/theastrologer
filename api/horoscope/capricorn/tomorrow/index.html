They're probably a little peeved at you today -- instead of staying calm and working with them, you're letting yourself get all uptight and controlling. Change might make you a little jumpy today, but dive in, even if it seems like a challenge. It's called 'personal growth.' You can do it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
