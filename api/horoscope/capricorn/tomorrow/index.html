    "horoscope": "Even though you're excited about that bit of business you've been plugging away on, it's important that you restrain yourself for another day. Your new ideas are still in committee, after all. This is not the time to implement a plan that's untested or not-yet-approved. Besides, you're too cautious to leap out into thinwith no parachute. So take your time and go through the proper channels to get the backing you need. If you want others' support, keep being nice to them. Otherwise, they could easily find other endeavors that need their assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
