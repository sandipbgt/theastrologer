    "horoscope": "You really did your prep work thoroughly, didn't you? You painstakingly researched all the possibilities, and you viewed your project with a constructive eye for detail and improvement. Now, you get to sit back for a day and let the chips fall where they may. Don't worry -- you prepared for this! So enjoy the temporary thrill this period brings. This is your lucky moment, except it's not exactly luck, is it? It's the result of your dedicated effort and careful planning. Now you'll reap the rewards.
