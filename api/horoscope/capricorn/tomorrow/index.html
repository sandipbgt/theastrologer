    "horoscope": "Somehow you're both uptight and spaced out. Sounds messy, doesn't it? It's like you're setting yourself up for a fall, confident you'll forget this trick you're playing on yourself.  There are better ways to deal with any obsessions or grievances you might have. The first thing is to stop fixating on what you can't control. Then, take full responsibility for whatever is in your power to improve. Throw your inner child a party. Invite only the people who know how to have a good time. It's the best gift you can give yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
