    "horoscope": "You're competitive by nature, and today that urge to defeat your challenger runs strong within you. In your mind, second best isn't good enough! But before you commence your quest for the top, think about whether it's really that important. Also, consider the example you're setting. If you're in charge of children, students or employees, it may be better to send a message about doing your personal best rather than being number one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
