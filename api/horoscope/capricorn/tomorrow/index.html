    "horoscope": "Issues at home or with your family claim your attention today. Your natural response might be to hide behind work or other responsibilities. But you'll find that running away from these issues doesn't make them go away. It's better just to face them and deal with them, even if doing so is emotionally tough. Try to keep a positive attitude. These are the people you care about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
