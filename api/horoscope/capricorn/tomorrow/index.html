    "horoscope": "Today you're willing to push hard for what you want. That may be appropriate in some situations, but not in others. That makes it especially important to choose your battles carefully. Don't let the current influence turn you into a bully! Instead, tap into your natural sense of honor and practicality. Let these qualities guide you in doing the right thing. That way, you'll be fierce competition in the proper setting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
