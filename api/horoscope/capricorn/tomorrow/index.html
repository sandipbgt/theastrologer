There's little danger of taking on more than you can handle, because you're quite realistic about the limits of your time, energy and abilities. This makes you something of an efficiency expert! Bring this influence to your work or other projects, and you're sure to find success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
