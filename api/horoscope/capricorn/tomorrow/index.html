    "horoscope": "You're in charge, and good thing, since you're fantastic at guarding against accidents and sabotage. This is how you show you care. Stay constant, careful, and dedicated today. Deliberate action takes you where you need to go, helping you hit the right notes at work and at home. The thing is, though, you have to take that action in an area you're not totally comfortable with -- the realm of messy, subjective emotions. Capricorn, let your loved ones know you adore them. If you're feeling lonely or insecure, let them reassure you. This isn't scary -- it's what life is all about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
