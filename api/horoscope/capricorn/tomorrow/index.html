    "horoscope": "Criticism can be quite useful, when it's well-intended and carefully worded. But right now, you're not exactly a paragon of tact or sensitivity to others' feelings. Instead of upsetting people by voicing your disapproval at every opportunity, hold your tongue and give them the benefit of the doubt. Better yet, be sensitive to their hopes and dreams today. Maybe their optimism will rub off on you. If not, blow off steam with some rigorous exercise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
