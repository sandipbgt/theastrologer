    "horoscope": "It's a good day for connecting with people you love and trust. If you're feeling like a bit of a homebody, invite friends and family over to enjoy good food and company at your place. Everyone else is in the mood to connect, too. You'll have a wonderful time laughing over old memories. Best of all, in joining together today, you're creating yet another precious memory to store in your heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
