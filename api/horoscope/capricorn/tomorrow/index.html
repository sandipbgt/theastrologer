    "horoscope": "Watch how you speak to people today, especially your children, students, teammates or employees. The current cosmic energy makes you less sensitive than usual to others' feelings. You're just trying to get something accomplished, but you may not realize you've barked or snapped at someone. That could spark a rebellious reaction, and then a full-on confrontation is in effect. Show you're a strong yet gentle leader by modeling fairness and respect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
