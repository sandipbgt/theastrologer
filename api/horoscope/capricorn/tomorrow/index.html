    "horoscope": "Today's gentle cosmic energy pulls you out of your head and into your heart. Suddenly, your duties and aspirations don't seem as important as checking in with the people you love. This is more than simply asking if they have everything they need, and doing your best to fulfill their expectations. This is about making a true, loving, feeling connection. This is emotionally sustaining for you, too -- all the more reason to make it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
