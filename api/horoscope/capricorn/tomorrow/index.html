    "horoscope": "You're a natural leader, but today, it's best to blend into the crowd. When you're working on a group project of any kind, make the effort to be equal and inclusive. That will rack up cosmic brownie points, since people need to feel their input is valued. In fact, that's a good way for you to take leadership in a more invisible way: Set an example for everyone by praising all contributions equally.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
