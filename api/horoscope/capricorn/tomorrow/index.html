    "horoscope": "You're deeply in touch with your emotions today, which enriches all your conversations and experiences. Often you tend to ignore feelings in favor of responsibility, rules and logic. But now you're able to let those left-brain things go enough to focus on the more creative, intuitive side of life. It's a good time to deepen your connections with the people you love, because you're in an affectionate and demonstrative mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
