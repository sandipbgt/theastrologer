You can bring deftness to everything from folding laundry to cooking a meal for your family, or building a bird feeder to hang on your back porch. Your professional output can be a work of art in its own right, too. And it feels good to put such care into your work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
