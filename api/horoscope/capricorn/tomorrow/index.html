    "horoscope": "You have a flair for the dramatic. It's well-concealed, but it's there. And today it comes out in full force. Try to direct it toward something selfless, such as a romantic gesture to wow your sweetie. Otherwise, you might end up boasting about your professional accomplishments or your big plans for the future. Everyone wants their true intelligence and capabilities to be known, but modesty can be even more impressive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
