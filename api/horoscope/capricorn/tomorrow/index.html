    "horoscope": "Today's deeply focused energy is certainly an asset in your work, but it can be just as revealing in your personal relationships. Focus on someone you love and trust today, and make a deep, intense connection as you explore one another's emotions and psyches. A soul-searching conversation with a good friend opens doors you hadn't even anticipated, and a romantic evening with your sweetheart makes you feel reborn.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
