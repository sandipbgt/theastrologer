    "horoscope": "Even if work is hectic and your home life is hopping, you're at the eye of the storm: You're calm, centered and in control as life rages around you. You can look forward to some relaxation time today. And for once, you won't fight the downtime; you're glad to feel so sedate and satisfied. Anything vigorous can wait till later. For now, focus on pleasure. Buy yourself a treat: a little indulgence is in order.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
