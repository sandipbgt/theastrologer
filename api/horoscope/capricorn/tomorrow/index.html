Don't be snobbish about things you think are obvious. Everyone learns at their own pace -- even you. Maybe you're the one who isn't seeing things clearly. Someone else could be miles ahead of you, waiting for you to calm down and catch up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
