    "horoscope": "You're a take-charge kind of person, but today, it's important to work closely with others. Even if you're the leader of a group of kids or a team of employees, avoid issuing orders. Instead, ask people for their input, and cooperate as much as possible. This brings everyone a warm, fuzzy feeling -- you included. And getting along feels so much better right now than going it alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
