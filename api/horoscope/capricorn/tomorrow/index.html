    "horoscope": "You're a doer and a maker. That might include doing as little as possible and making excuses about it, but it doesn't have to. You can still accomplish great things by tomorrow if you move carefully. Don't let traditions tie you down or fear hold you back. At the same time, don't let images of impossible success go to your head. That's a lot of 'don't' for a doer like you. Obviously there are a few self-control issues on the table. If you need some perspective, ask for advice. You might end up choosing to do the exact opposite, but it's OK if you're acting with clarity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
