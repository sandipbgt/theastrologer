    "horoscope": "You're a master at burying old emotional wounds beneath a calm, practical exterior. In fact, preserving your game face is one of your singular talents. But sometimes, you feel freed from those old, uneasy feelings. In certain moments, they just don't seem so difficult anymore. This is one of those times, when you can forgive at the heart level and move on for good. What a relief! Even more than that, though, you've been given a chance to surge forward in your life with a clear heart and conscience.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
