In fact, work could feel like an even bigger pressure if you don't have as much time to devote to it as usual. But this is no time to get stressed out over your many responsibilities. Make a firm, conscious decision to relax and enjoy the fun, lighthearted vibe surrounding you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
