Perhaps you've been struck by a bolt of genius and you have something completely new in mind. For now, it's best to temper your wild visions with some common sense. Don't go rushing into something brand-new and untested. You're too cautious for that, anyway, and this just isn't the moment. Instead, preserve order and dignity for another day. That would be your own dignity, by the way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
