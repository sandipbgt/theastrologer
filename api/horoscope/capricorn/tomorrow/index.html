Caution is almost always better than getting critical and upset. Honesty is a good approach, too, especially if you're feeling insecure. It's hard for you to open up about your feelings of vulnerability, but doing just that will have the best results now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
