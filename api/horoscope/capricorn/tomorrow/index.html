    "horoscope": "You feel driven today toward a certain goal. You can envision the outcome you desire perfectly in your mind's eye. That makes it easier to concentrate your energies and push forward. If you keep this up, this could turn out to be an exciting day! At the very least, you'll have a lot more information this evening than you had this morning. That's what happens when you dig deep and get focused.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
