    "horoscope": "The fire of determination blazes within you today. If you have a full to-do list, you can burn through tasks like dry leaves. But applying yourself to one or two bigger projects is even better. Do try to work on your own, if possible. If you're part of a team, delegate some tasks to other people and reserve some for yourself. It's important to have a sense of ownership over what you produce.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
