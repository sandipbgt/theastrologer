    "horoscope": "Being sloppy or otherwise out of control is a rare occurrence for you. Carelessness just isn't your style. But today you're the very picture of stability. Your family and work mates know they can rely on you, because you're both smart and strong enough to handle whatever might come up with grace and style. Don't let it go to your head, though. This positive energy won't be available for long. It's a gift to be appreciated and utilized effectively.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
