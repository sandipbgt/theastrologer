Thus, it's time to access that energy and apply it to something that means a great deal to you. Your mood and intentions are aligned with the universe, and you've got a great chance now at success. Another day of persistence will bring brilliant results, and you'll be glad you kept trying.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
