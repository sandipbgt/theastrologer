    "horoscope": "You've got something in the works, something potentially quite big. Your vision is grand and far-reaching. But don't feel too frustrated if your current resources or abilities don't stretch quite as far as your imagination. This shouldn't be a cause for worry. Use this brief period as a chance to build your skills and gather more supplies, funds or other support. Then, when you're ready, you'll know you're truly prepared to make this dream a reality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
