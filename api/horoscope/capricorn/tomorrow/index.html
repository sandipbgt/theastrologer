Since it's so easy to spot the bottom line, it's easy to make the right plans or take the correct steps toward your goals. If only every day could be this straightforward! Take advantage of this energy. Delve into your list of tasks. Be as detail-oriented as possible. And tie up any and all loose ends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
