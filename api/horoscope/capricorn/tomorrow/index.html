    "horoscope": "Today is a great day to bend the rules a little -- or toss them out completely. If the very idea of that fills you with dread, that's an indication that breaking the rules is something you should indulge in a little more often! The whole purpose of days like today is to shake you up a little, and jostle you out of your comfortable, ordered existence. Have a little fun with this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
