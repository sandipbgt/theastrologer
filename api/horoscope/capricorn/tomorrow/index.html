    "horoscope": "Today finds you in an irritable mood. If someone challenges you, you're likely to snarl right back at them. You like what you like -- so there. That's your attitude, anyway, but it may not go over well with anyone you're trying to impress. It's better to watch your mouth and your temper. When your ire starts to rise, consider that maybe what seems like a challenge is really a bit of constructive criticism.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
