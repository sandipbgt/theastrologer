    "horoscope": "You don't feel as grounded today as usual. You might find yourself nervously tapping your fingers when working quietly at your desk, or talking a mile a minute instead of listening carefully. Some days are just like this. Blow off steam with physical exercise or a few minutes of deep breathing. Or, tailor your day to match your mood. Making phone calls or running errands helps you maximize this energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
