    "horoscope": "You may not see eye to eye with everyone today. You're interested in protecting your own possessions or beliefs, but the people around you are concerned with the general good -- and probably at the cost of the individual. It's hard to see how the two sides can coexist, but your challenge is to find a way. Seeking common ground sure beats a face-off. Avoid taking sides, and see if you can make everyone satisfied.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
