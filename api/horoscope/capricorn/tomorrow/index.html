    "horoscope": "The past might haunt you today. It's good to have memories, although how you're using them now might be a problem. Disconnect from what happened last week or last month instead of letting it call the shots for every move you make in the present. Others are sure to notice your alienation or withdrawal if that's how you end up dealing with this. Don't punish them for something they didn't do. And while you're at it, stop punishing yourself, too. That was then, this is now, and tomorrow could be anything you want.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
