    "horoscope": "Things need fixing. People need talking to. So whose job is this? Well, no one else is volunteering. You want to be strict, but you're probably having mixed feelings. Being the silver-tongued administrator or the iron-fisted dictator is against your basic nature. Business is business, but you have your limits. Maybe you don't really need to be pushing so hard. Maybe your version of personal growth means live and let live. There will be changes today, but will you be the one to make them? These things might have to happen in their own time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
