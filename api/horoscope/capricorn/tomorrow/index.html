    "horoscope": "You are rarely an impulsive person. You tend to think things through carefully before acting. But if ever you were to be in a spontaneous mood, it would be today. You might even find yourself behaving in reckless ways! Thank goodness your natural sense of caution puts the brakes on anything too hasty. Still, it's a good idea to watch out for curves in the road ahead. Use your common sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
