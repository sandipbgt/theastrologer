Multitasking is no problem now, because you know what to delegate and how to manage the tasks left on your plate. This is a prime position for getting just about anything accomplished that you set your mind to. Activities related to finances and your career are especially favored now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
