Put solid, focused effort into this project today -- nothing flashy or overly aggressive -- and you'll find that things work out the way you want. You might think untapped resources aren't worthy of your attention, but trying to pick up on every opportunity that comes your way could be tantamount to overdoing it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
