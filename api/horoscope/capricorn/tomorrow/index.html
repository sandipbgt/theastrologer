    "horoscope": "In many ways, you feel right at home today. You're surrounded by a familiar energy, and you can feel yourself ready to grow -- maybe not right away, but soon. Consequently, you might find yourself doing something out of character, like giving away your belongings to strangers or connecting with people from faraway places. These actions feel right.
