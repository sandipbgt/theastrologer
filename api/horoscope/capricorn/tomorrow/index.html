Instead, relax a little and let things take their natural course. That's hard for you, isn't it? Try to enjoy the break. But do be conservative as you count and codify the variables. There's no need to relax your principles or your expectations. Keep a careful log of any progress you make, and soon you can match it against the outcome you initially projected. You'll find that it all makes sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
