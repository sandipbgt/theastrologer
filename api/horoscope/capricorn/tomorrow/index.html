    "horoscope": "You work hard for your money, and today is a good day to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Take some time off work, if possible. Treat a friend to dinner, or better yet, find ways to connect that don't cost anything at all. Your energy is grounded and your body feels strong. Simple pleasures, such as a long walk with a loved one, can be just as satisfying as something more expensive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
