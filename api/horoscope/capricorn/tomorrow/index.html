    "horoscope": "Your personal ambitions assert themselves today in your consciousness. Career goals, especially, might suddenly claim your attention. And it's a great day to work toward them, because your energy is so strong and steady. You feel wonderfully centered and grounded. This helps you perform at your optimum pace and intensity. Pulling long hours at the office is no problem. And performing an endurance-based workout only enhances your mood and energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
