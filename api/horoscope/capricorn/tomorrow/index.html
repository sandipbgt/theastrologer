    "horoscope": "People are always saying you work too hard and view life too seriously, which makes the current irony that much more annoying -- that your attempt at a practical joke went so wrong. You were just having a little fun, but the current energy is tricky. Maybe you didn't come across as you intended. Whatever happened, you ended up getting stung, and now you're feeling a little waspish. It never crossed your mind that this thing would backfire. Oh, well, at least this mood only lasts a day. Lay low if you can, and wear a good-natured smile.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
