    "horoscope": "Finding fault comes a little too easily to you today. Instead of being warm, kind and accepting, you're pointing out others' flaws and subjecting them to unfairly high standards. It's certainly possible that you have a valid point, but the other person isn't likely to listen until you present it in a reasonable way. And that's fair. So work on your delivery. That way, you'll get the right information across in the right way, and you can move forward from there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
