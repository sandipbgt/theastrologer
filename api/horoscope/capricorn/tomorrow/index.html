    "horoscope": "Your hardworking nature emerges today. Any project you work on now may resemble the parable of the tortoise and the hare. The hare represents everyone around you who ignores rules and works quickly, just trying to get the job done. And the tortoise? That's you -- moving ahead in slow, steady, methodical steps. That's the best way to do any job today, because it's the only way to ensure that you'll reach the finish line.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
