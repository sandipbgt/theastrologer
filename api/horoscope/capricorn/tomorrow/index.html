    "horoscope": "Today your urge for public recognition intensifies. You may not even realize you're feeling such a need for attention; you might just catch yourself boasting about your accomplishments. You might also feel irritated if someone receives accolades you believe you deserve. Do your best to let others have their time in the spotlight. It's important to trust that your time will come, too, even if it doesn't happen to be today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
