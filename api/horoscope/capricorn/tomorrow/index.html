    "horoscope": "You're forging ahead with great energy, surefooted as you head toward your goals. Moving forward at this slow, steady pace, you're sure to make substantial gains by the end of the day. Of course, you've kept up this effort for several days now. By evening, call it good enough. Rest your body, even if your mind doesn't want to cooperate. Remember practical activities like exercising, eating and sleeping. These are important for keeping your body strong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
