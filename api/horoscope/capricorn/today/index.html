    "horoscope": "You're extra determined today to reach your goals. You have the stamina needed to put in long hours on a particular project, especially if its completion will mean a boost in your income or some other tangible result. Generally speaking, the more concrete your motivation is, the better. You're much more willing to work for results you can see, touch and measure than for something vague or indefinable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
