    "horoscope": "Steady, grounded energy courses through you today, allowing you to give thorough attention and effort to anything on your to-do list. And you're more practical-minded than ever. So it's easy to focus on what's important and discard the rest. You know that saying, 'Keep it simple, silly'? That's just what you're doing now. And you could get so much accomplished that you complete your work early! That leaves more time for family and fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
