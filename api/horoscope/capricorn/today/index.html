    "horoscope": "Balance is especially important today, so keep it in mind as a goal in everything you do. Avoid working too much, and make sure you eat regular, wholesome meals. Balance your checkbook or spend some time cleaning up something that really needs it. Excess in any area isn't favorable now. It's a good time to make sure the important areas of your life are in stable equilibrium.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
