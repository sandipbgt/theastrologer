The phone might ring off the hook, or your instant-message may chime again and again, signaling that there's yet more communication to handle. And in the end, is anything of substance really getting across? Maybe, or maybe not. Do your best to pass along important information, and keep idle chitchat to a minimum. That will make it easier to focus.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
