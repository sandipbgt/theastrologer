    "horoscope": "When life takes an emotional turn, your response may be to disregard your own feelings and others', because talking about them feels too much like playing into drama. But today's cosmic influence urges you to treat yourself and others with loving kindness, and that includes facing those sticky feelings you might rather ignore. Even just listening with compassion can be enough to make the other person feel understood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
