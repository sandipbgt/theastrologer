    "horoscope": "Today, duty calls at home. A close friend or relative may need you, which might pull you away from your own pursuits. If so, try not to resist or resent it! That would just make things more uncomfortable for you. Still, it's tough not to feel pulled in two. Do your best to create a balance, and trust that things will ease up in a day or two.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
