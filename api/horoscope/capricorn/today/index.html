    "horoscope": "You're a take-charge kind of person. After all, you're a natural leader. But today, the focus is on teamwork. Strive to treat your team of friends, relatives or coworkers as equals. That includes seeking their input and treating it as valid, even if someone offers up a truly wacky idea. Don't worry about taking missteps or making mistakes. Incorporate a sense of discovery as you test theories and devise a workable plan.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
