    "horoscope": "Focus on your loved ones' feelings and needs, and your own. Don't assume you already know everyone's needs -- instead, check in with them. See if they're satisfied in terms of intimacy, affection, and attention. Next, check in with yourself. Do you feel well-loved and supported? Are you showing your devotion as much as you could? Focus on these questions, and life will start making a lot more sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
