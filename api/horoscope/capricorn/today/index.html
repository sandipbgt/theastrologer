You're certainly teachable, but today, you'll have to work for any knowledge you gain. You can't have everything handed to you, after all. Think of this as the tradition of the masters, carried forward to the future. Direct research and experience are a must now. Strive to understand the deeper implications of what you're doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
