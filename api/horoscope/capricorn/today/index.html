    "horoscope": "Many people have a real need for freedom and autonomy today. If you're in charge of a group of people, you might try to direct their work or behavior, since you have high standards and well-defined expectations. But as difficult as this may be, it's better now to let people do their own thing. That includes letting them make their own mistakes. Trust them to learn from their errors and move on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
