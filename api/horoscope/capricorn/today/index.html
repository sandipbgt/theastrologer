    "horoscope": "Today isn't a good day for pushing yourself, physically or mentally. No matter what you might have planned, it's subject to change under the current cosmic influence. For example, you might trade a vigorous workout for an extra hour of sleep, or working late for coming home early to spend time with your family. You just aren't feeling that energetic, and that's not a bad thing. It's smart to adjust your schedule to your mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
