    "horoscope": "You have plenty of energy today to accomplish whatever you have on your agenda. But being so driven has its downside, too. You've set high standards, and you really want to shine. Most of all, you want other people to see what you're capable of. Remember, if recognition doesn't come, it doesn't mean you don't deserve it or that you didn't do a good job. It may just be delayed until later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
