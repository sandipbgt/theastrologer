    "horoscope": "Today brings tension. Your natural response is to pretend you're stronger than you really feel. But it's all too easy to lose your balance if you allow your head to swell. Isolation is also a byproduct of this mood. Perhaps you're feeling lonely and misunderstood, as if no one in the world 'gets' you at your core. But you have just as many friends and admirers as you did yesterday. Try to connect with some of them. You could turn these worries into something fun with a simple, conscious shift in attitude.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
