But there's also a really warm, affectionate energy at work right now. It would be so much better to tap into that than to play into the tendency toward pettiness and theatrics. Spend time with positive people who make you feel confident about yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
