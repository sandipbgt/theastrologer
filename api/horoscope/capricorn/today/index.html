    "horoscope": "Your independence runs strong within you today. Standing on your own two feet becomes a point of pride. You won't depend on anyone but yourself, and you can shoulder any burden that comes your way! Right? Just remember, no one is an island. If you need help, support or just a friendly ear, don't be afraid to ask. It won't make you look weak. Besides, there's nothing wrong with vulnerability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
