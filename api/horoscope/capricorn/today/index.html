    "horoscope": "Your energy is far from grounded today, and this could be a distinctly uncomfortable state of mind. But you're full of creative ideas, so try to find a way to center yourself and keep playing with the words and images that come to you. Don't be surprised if you're flat-out frazzled by the end of the day. It's understandable, considering all the conversations and other interactions you'll have with people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
