    "horoscope": "Today you're extra conscious of your responsibility toward your family or your work, or perhaps both. Maybe you're feeling the pressure of bringing in a good income to support yourself and the people you care about. Or perhaps you're feeling the tension that results from trying to balance time at home with time at your desk. Just do your best to stay focused, and try not to wear yourself out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
