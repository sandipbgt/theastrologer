    "horoscope": "Everyone is impressed with your sensible, efficient approach to life. Today promises to be one of those brief periods when big things happen: Maybe you'll be offered a raise or promotion, or you'll take a positive personal step toward greater fitness or well-being.

Remember that health is as much about relaxation as it is about effort and discipline.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
