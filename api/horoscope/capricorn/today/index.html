If you're worried about something regarding your security or your future, keep in mind this is probably a temporary concern. You're just a bit more sensitive today to potential risks. You can turn this into a positive by looking for ways to increase stability in your job, finances or some other realm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
