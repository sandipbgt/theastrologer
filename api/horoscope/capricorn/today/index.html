    "horoscope": "Feeling scattered and unfocused is making you nervous, and that's just the way it's going to have to be right now. It's hard to concentrate at work, and things at home aren't much better. You might want to just get away from it all and stick your head in the sand any way you can. That's actually not a bad idea. Secluding yourself from any distractions can help you narrow your focus to just one thing right now. Plus, it will help you avoid having to answer awkward questions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
