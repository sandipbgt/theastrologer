    "horoscope": "You're methodical in your approach to work and other responsibilities today. You'll find that a logical, step-by-step process works best in almost any situation. You tend to focus naturally on the standard that has been set or the rules that have been established, and under the current influence, that focus pays off. At the very least, your performance will impress your employer or set a good example for others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
