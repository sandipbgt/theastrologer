    "horoscope": "A bout of creative thinking makes you seem unconventional in other people's eyes today. Isn't it fun to keep your friends or coworkers on their toes? Just when they think they've got you all figured out, you throw them a curve ball. And there's definitely a method to your madness, as everyone will soon see. For now, don't worry about what others think. Work solo, if you have to. Just keep chasing down these brilliant ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
