    "horoscope": "Not getting what you want today could make you grouchy. You know you're deserving, so having to give ground to someone else feels like such a letdown.

Instead of issuing commands and ultimatums, you could try simply living gracefully with the disappointment, and quickly move on. You'll get your way soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
