It's good to do your research and prepare yourself thoroughly for the project ahead, but make sure you aren't just procrastinating. Sometime soon, you'll have to stop processing all this info and start using it to act. That shouldn't be too difficult, though. You're amply prepared, and where your research and planning leave off, your own intelligence will kick in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
