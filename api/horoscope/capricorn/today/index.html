    "horoscope": "Your imagination is turned on today. You might wake from a dream and have a hard time determining whether its events happened in real life. This sense of unreality extends throughout the day -- and surprisingly, it isn't uncomfortable. It's actually enjoyable to realize that the separation between fact and fantasy isn't as great as you thought. With just a little creativity, you can embellish something dull into a vision of vivid invention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
