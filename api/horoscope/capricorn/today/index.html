    "horoscope": "Today it's hard to choose just one project, path or option. How can you commit to one when the others seem equally viable? Don't drive yourself crazy worrying about making the wrong decision. You can either hold off until you've gathered more information, or just make a decision. It may turn out to be the right one, or you might have to go back and correct your course. Would that be so bad?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
