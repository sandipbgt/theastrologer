    "horoscope": "You're strong when you need to be, and that's certainly true today. Inner strength and courage are yours, which could come in handy in a variety of situations.

Avoid that by taking the time to assess things before responding.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
