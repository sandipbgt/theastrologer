    "horoscope": "Today it's as important as ever to base your ideas and actions in proper research. But now there's added emphasis on stepping outside the box, especially in your thinking. Toss that sense of caution you carry like a protective shield right out the window. There's nothing wrong with getting a little experimental! Innovative thinking is favored now. A well-founded idea can only be strengthened by being tested in the real world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
