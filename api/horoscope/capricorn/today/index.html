    "horoscope": "You've always been solid at your core, and that's what people are attracted to. Keep that in mind now, because though you're feeling energetic and ambitious, this may not be the time to let that energy loose on the world. Excessive vitality could all too easily undercut that solid foundation of yours. At the moment, people just want to know you're dependable -- they're not looking for you to be vibrant and enthusiastic. Similarly, instead of striking out in new, observe your ties with the past today. They'll help define your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
