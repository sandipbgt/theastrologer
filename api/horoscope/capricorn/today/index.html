    "horoscope": "Individuality is flowing freely, or at least it should. You're not helping anything if you shut yourself down and hide your true identity. On the other hand, it would be so easy to go overboard with self-indulgence. Somewhere in there is a happy medium. Be less rigid about what you can or can't do today. And be more mindful about what could interfere with other people's lives. Exactly what are you afraid of, anyway? It's good to be on a first name basis with your fears. That way, they won't look so threatening.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
