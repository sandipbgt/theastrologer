This might mean considering your family's feelings before your own, or your coworkers' ideas; it might also mean volunteering to do some charity work, or making a financial donation to a cause you support. Find a way to honor the fact that you're one small part of a greater whole.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
