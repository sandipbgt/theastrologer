    "horoscope": "It's a busy time of year, and there's so much to do. So why is everyone in such a lighthearted mood? And what's with all these parties? Your irritation is real and may be justified, but will being pompous or stuck-up really help? That may be your usual mode of relating to others, much to their dismay. Try to communicate gently today. You'll win fans and influence people for the better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
