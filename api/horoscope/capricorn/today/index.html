Snags don't faze you; in fact, you view any obstacles that crop up as interesting puzzles to solve. You're more than up to the task today, and people are sure to notice. At the very least, your work output will be detail-oriented, thorough and focused on quality. You might even secure a promotion or a new client as a direct result of your current efforts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
