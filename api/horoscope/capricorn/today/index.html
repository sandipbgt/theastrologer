This might be a literal trimming of the fat -- perhaps you need to revisit your diet and exercise regimen! Or it may refer to your budget, including both spending habits and maximizing your income. Whatever you focus on, make it your goal to streamline the processes that keep you functioning on a day-to-day basis.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
