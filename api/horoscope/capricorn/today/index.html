    "horoscope": "You're setting the bar high today. You have a vision in mind of your expectations for anything from a project to your behavior and others', and you know you're going to get what you want. Where does that calm assurance come from? Probably from the fact that you feel so centered and capable under the current influence. You know you can manage any project or problem that comes your way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
