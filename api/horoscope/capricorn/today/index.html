    "horoscope": "You're in a sympathetic mood today, and compassion comes more easily than usual. You may find yourself being more lenient in your expectations of yourself or other people. This is a smart move, because lots of people are easily distracted now -- you included. It's hard to apply yourself to your responsibilities with the usual level of dedication. Take some time off for rest and relaxation, if you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
