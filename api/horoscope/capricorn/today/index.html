    "horoscope": "Intensity of feeling makes for powerful experiences today. The bonds you share with the people you love run deep and true. In fact you derive a great deal of strength from them. This fuels your determination to accomplish whatever you've set for yourself as a goal. That could be related to your career or a more personal journey. Knowing you have someone's support makes you infinitely stronger and more self-assured.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
