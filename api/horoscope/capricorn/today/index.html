    "horoscope": "It's rarely difficult for you to focus your energy, especially today, when you're feeling strong and centered. This is no time to coast through life. Rather, harness this feeling of strength and power, and make a solid push toward something meaningful. Anything related to health issues or an opportunity for travel would be good now. Plan a vacation, sign up with a personal trainer, start a kitchen garden. These would be positive uses of your time and energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
