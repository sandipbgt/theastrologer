    "horoscope": "You regularly rely on reason to help you determine the best course in life. But today, cold, hard facts may not be as important as a larger, more philosophical viewpoint.

But you'll find that taking the broad view makes a lot more sense than you might have anticipated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
