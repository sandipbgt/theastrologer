    "horoscope": "You may be a little moody today. You could be easily insulted and ready to snap at anyone who seems to get in your way. The problem is, they're just going about their business. You're feeling more sensitive than usual, and you're taking things too personally. Let other people off the hook, and see about dealing with your own issues. Take care of yourself and others will follow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
