It's great to get deeply absorbed in your work, especially if you're interested in the actual substance of it -- not just the paycheck it brings. Similarly, it's important to live up to your familial duties. Do so from a place of love, not obligation. Prioritize your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
