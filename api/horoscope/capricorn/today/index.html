This is one of your natural strengths, and now it's heightened. Rely on your mind and your instincts to guide you throughout your day. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. But don't be afraid to take carefully calculated risks. That's how you move ahead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
