    "horoscope": "It's always been easier for you to focus on the bottom line -- cost, efficiency, and goals -- than on feelings -- yours or anyone else's. But today highlights internal, subjective concerns, such as your home life, your family, the devotion you're giving out, and the love you're taking in. Maybe you feel that going deeply into these issues costs too much. In that case, keep your head up and your heart carefully guarded, if you can. But chances are, you can't -- real feelings are sure to seep in. If so, pay attention, and make any necessary adjustments.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
