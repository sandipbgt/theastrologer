You might be on the brink of launching a brand-new venture, but you still need to act sensibly today. Show everyone that you're worthy of honor and responsibility. And don't worry about anything else that comes up. Your personal magnetism is on high now, and that will take care of the rest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
