    "horoscope": "You have a strong sense of your own inner power today. You're a leader. But don't be surprised if others don't seem to bow to your authority in the way you might prefer. Lots of people are feeling independent today. In fact, most people want to stand on their own two feet, and hardly anyone wants to take direction from someone else. You're better off letting others do their thing while you do yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
