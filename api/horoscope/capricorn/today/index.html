There's always some kind of trick for fixing things in your memory. Put it in whatever order makes sense. Even if you're not actively learning, concentrate your thoughts and efforts today. If you believe you can turn a temporary gig into a permanent fixture, go for it. And if all you want is another tool in your utility belt, you'll earn the right to carry it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
