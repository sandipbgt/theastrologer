    "horoscope": "Your ambitious side stirs today. You know you've worked hard and done a good job, and you want the gains that come from applying yourself so faithfully. And you certainly deserve recognition, a raise, a promotion... But what if none of those comes your way? Will you still put effort into your projects? If you're doing something purely for the fame, it's hard to stay motivated for long. Seek deeper meaning in your work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
