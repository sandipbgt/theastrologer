    "horoscope": "Be sure to express your true, honest thoughts and your original ideas today, even if doing so feels uncomfortable. At least it's real, which the people around you will appreciate, whether they agree with you or not. And you'll almost certainly feel cleansed once you get these thoughts out of your head and onto the table. How else can you determine which ones are viable? Bottling them inside will only make them stale, leaving you with a noticeable lack of energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
