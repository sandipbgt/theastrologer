You're working hard, taking all the right steps toward your goals and feeling great about your output. You're firm but kind with coworkers, family and friends alike. There's no need to use other people as stepping stones; now you're helping them climb their own ladders of success. Doesn't it feel great to be such a positive influence in the lives of the people around you? Make it count.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
