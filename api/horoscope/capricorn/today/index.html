    "horoscope": "Be uppity with a smile on your face. Make your agenda look like nothing more than a mood. Negativity will send up red flags today, and you don't want them to lose trust in you the way you've lost trust in them. Cheerfully flout the rules by following them. Be the dutiful robot or the passive-aggressive troublemaker, if these things are necessary. This isn't like you at all, which of course will be the key to your success. People just aren't expecting it from you. After this little episode, they'll think differently of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
