It's easy now to be drawn toward a flashy but risky approach, but you need to maintain your focus. Actually, this is a good test for you. Since you're naturally goal-oriented, it's good for you to experience a bit of greener-grass syndrome from time to time. Whatever it is that suddenly looks so surefire and enticing, resist the urge to chase it. Instead, stay on task for your current project. You can move ahead once you know exactly what you're doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
