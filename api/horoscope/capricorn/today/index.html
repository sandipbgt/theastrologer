    "horoscope": "They're ignorant but determined, and that's not such a great mix. If you're full of yourself and easily annoyed, you won't be helping the situation, either. Try to communicate about what's bothering you, and try even harder to keep it positive. Say 'we could' instead of 'you have to.' If that starting point is too ambitious, talk about the weather or stay in the more obvious safety zones of cultural or political small talk. It's the only way to reach common ground. And you so need to get there, because not much good will happen until you do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
