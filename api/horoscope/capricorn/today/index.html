    "horoscope": "Today, it's especially easy to ground everything you do in cool, hard logic. That's the current cosmic influence at work, creating your favorite kind of energy. For you, life is easier when logic and reason have the upper hand -- when it's a simple process to distinguish right from wrong, or to prioritize your goals and then achieve them one by one. Enjoy this simplicity while it lasts. Use it to accomplish something important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
