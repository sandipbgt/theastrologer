    "horoscope": "Pride could make you surly. Overconfidence might lead to taking unreasonable chances. Are you sure you want to go there? You're just raising expectations for success and/or setting yourself up for spectacular failure. Instead of taking the risk of going down in a blaze of glory, why not opt for a day of silent, modest greatness? That would include more trust and tolerance for people who, as far as you're concerned, lack your gifts and advantages. But even if you really are a superior being, don't act like one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
