    "horoscope": "Reach out to a child, a pet or someone else you love today. Lending your assistance to someone who needs it is a great way to tap into the current energy. You're feeling tender and compassionate. If someone needs your strength, you can sense it, and you genuinely want to help. You're practical enough to keep your personal boundaries in place, too. That creates the perfect balance of helping others while protecting yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
