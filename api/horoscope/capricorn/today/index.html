    "horoscope": "If you find yourself behaving irritably toward others today, overreacting at perceived criticisms or slights, take it as a sign you're in a highly emotional mind space. When you're feeling like this, get some alone time. Retreat to your bedroom or office, just for a few minutes. Even the simple act of taking a few relaxing breaths will help you repair your feelings and get back on an even keel.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
