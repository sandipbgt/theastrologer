    "horoscope": "You're a reckless daredevil. You're also a wary paranoid. And the fireworks really begin when these opposite sides of you start fighting for control over the life they share. The funny thing is that it's an even match, and the conflict will wear you down even as it goes nowhere. Break the stalemate before it breaks you. Mix the elements you've been struggling to keep separate. Oh, don't do it all at once. Stir in a little courage here and a little caution there. Take a conservative risk today and maybe a slightly more radical risk tomorrow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
