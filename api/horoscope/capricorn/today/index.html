    "horoscope": "You'll experience a distinct softening of the heart today. Emotional matters count far more now than your work or anything else that's rooted in logic. If you've experienced any tension or distance with a friend, it's a great day to bridge that gap. Extend a loving, supportive hand. Open up about your feelings. If there's any lesson to be learned today, it's that there is strength in vulnerability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
