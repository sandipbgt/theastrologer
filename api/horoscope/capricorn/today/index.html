    "horoscope": "Ask the big questions today, ones that might make you a little bit uncomfortable. You sense that their answers are complex. The good thing about asking deep questions now is that your mind is more open than usual, so it's easier to make sense of those broad answers. In fact, you're in a great position to come up with your own theories about theof life that you don't yet understand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
