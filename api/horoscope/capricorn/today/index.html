    "horoscope": "You may feel swamped today with memories of the past. Perhaps a recent experience reminds you of your childhood. Or maybe it's a dream that recalls something you'd forgotten. The emotions these thoughts bring up may be bittersweet, or even just bitter. But it's good to feel them anyway. Let them wash through you like a river. That's the quickest, best way for them to go away.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
