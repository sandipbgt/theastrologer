    "horoscope": "Think today about your goals for the future. Do you want to advance in your career, switch tracks altogether or even start your own business? Any of these is a worthy pursuit, and today is a great day for thinking over the steps you'll take to reach your goal. Logical thinking will get you where you want to go, and your practical perspective won't hurt, either. Get something in writing, even if it's for your eyes only.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
