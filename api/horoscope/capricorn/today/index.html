    "horoscope": "You aren't feeling very outgoing today, but that's okay. Even if you have a business meeting or other professional function to attend, you're sure to impress everyone with your levelheaded demeanor and rational thinking. And if you have social plans on the agenda, you'll win others' admiration with your calm, grounded energy. You're equal to any task that lies before you. This projects a very attractive level of self-confidence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
