    "horoscope": "Self-discipline is no trouble for you today. Not that it ever is, really! You rarely have a hard time focusing on your responsibilities. But today, work doesn't feel like work, and doing your duty brings a deep sense of satisfaction. You're creating stability for yourself and your family, and knowing that makes you proud. You're a solid success, no matter what you do with your time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
