    "horoscope": "Your old friends understand you best, because they've known you the longest, and have seen you in many different situations and phases of life. Your newer friends and acquaintances, on the other hand, are still learning about who you are and what you value. So be humble today if someone misjudges you, or misinterprets your actions. Instead of getting defensive or wounded, explain yourself and move on. And don't worry. They'll discover your inner light soon enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
