    "horoscope": "Today you may notice that you're feeling things at a deeper level than usual. Life itself offers more emotionally intense experiences. Everything you do, from hard work to interactions with people you love, feels as if it's full of meaningful lessons to be learned. Savor this. After all, this depth of feeling may be rare. And opportunities for greater self-awareness should always be taken advantage of, even if they're unexpected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
