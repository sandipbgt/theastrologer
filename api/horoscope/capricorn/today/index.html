    "horoscope": "If you want recognition, you'll persevere. You know that it's up to you to create your own success, and you're more than up to the task -- especially today. You're grounded and inspired now. Other people are sitting up and taking notice of all you're accomplishing. Energy, focus and ambition are on your side more than ever,, and you're in the perfect position to bargain for anything you need. Take the lead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
