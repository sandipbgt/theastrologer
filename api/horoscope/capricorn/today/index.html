You know what you're trying to accomplish and you have some good ideas about how to make it happen. Still, don't give up if all the good things you deserve don't come your way just yet. You're still in the building phase. Take your time and be thorough as you move through the steps. Later, you'll be glad you were so careful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
