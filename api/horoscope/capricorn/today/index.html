    "horoscope": "Of course you want to stand out: You're a hard worker, and you deserve recognition for your efforts and achievements. But today, concentrate those efforts on practical, unremarkable tasks. You'll impress people most simply by putting your energy into something worthwhile, and especially by tying up loose ends on a project. Others value your wisdom, you know. Not everyone is as advanced in their understanding of systems and processes as you are. Be sure to share your common sense in small doses, so they can keep up with you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
