    "horoscope": "Normally, putting your best and brightest energy into a project or a relationship is the surest way to success. Today, your zest and enthusiasm will cause you to overshoot the mark.

Just because you're quiet and dedicated at the moment doesn't mean your message is dull. Sometimes people like a little easy stability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
