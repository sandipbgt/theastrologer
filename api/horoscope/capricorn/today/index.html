    "horoscope": "You're traveling fast now, but it may be in the wrong direction. This is a day of runaway choices and slippery consequences. And doesn't that sound dangerous? Slow down. Surrender to the possibility that you might be wrong this time. Keep any bad feelings under control as you stay on the sunny side or at least look for the silver lining. If you give in to frustration or jealousy, angry neighbors might turn into enemies. Why not change your outlook? It would mean a lot to all of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
