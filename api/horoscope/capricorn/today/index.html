    "horoscope": "Try not to snap at your family or coworkers today. Yes, you're trying to get work done, and their noisy capers are more than distracting. But can you blame them for wanting to have a little fun? The whole world is in a warm, playful mood. Just because you're the impatient one doesn't mean you should unleash your inner beast or critic.
