    "horoscope": "Your friends and colleagues know you as a traditional, hardworking type of person. But today, you have a chance to show them your radical side. And yes, you do have one! Especially now, when your thinking is truly inspired. Innovative ideas form seemingly out of the blue -- especially when you're engaged with other people on a project.
