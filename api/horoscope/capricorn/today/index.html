    "horoscope": "It's a good day for interchanges with business associates, friends and family. But all the back-and-forth could leave you feeling stressed out and drained by the end of the day. Instead of feeling rushed all day long, remind yourself to take deep breaths and focus. Take a break or two as well. At least a few moments of alone time are critical when you're feeling high-strung.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
