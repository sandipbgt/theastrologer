Sometimes it's very helpful to stretch the boundaries of your imagination. For now, go ahead and build castles in the sand without worry for how they might hold up in the future. Your focus today should be on experimentation. You could easily surprise yourself by coming up with something both creative and sensible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
