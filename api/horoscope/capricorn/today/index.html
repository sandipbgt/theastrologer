    "horoscope": "Communication takes center stage today. Do your best to keep it light, even when you're discussing heavy or important subjects. And don't just talk -- listen, too! If other people feel like you're just issuing orders, they're less likely to do your bidding. But if you keep your tone light and humorous, and listen to others' input and concerns, everything you do now will be a success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
