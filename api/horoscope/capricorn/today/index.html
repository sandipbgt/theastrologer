    "horoscope": "You might feel a little lonely today. Your instinct is often to bury yourself in work -- nothing like a long task list to distract yourself! But a much better fix is to reach out to someone. Call a friend and ask them to dinner. Hug your sweetheart or your child. If it's human companionship that you're missing, nothing beats spending some relaxed quality time with your fellow humans.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
