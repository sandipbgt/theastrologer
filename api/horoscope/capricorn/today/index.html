    "horoscope": "You're normally rather placid, but today you're actually getting a little unruly. The people around you might start raising their eyebrows and exchanging significant glances, but there's something important they don't know: This is a classic case of 'what you see isn't what you get.' All this trouble is really another one of your cunning plans -- a clever distraction. Can you get away with it? Time will tell. Soon you'll be either satisfied or sorry.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
