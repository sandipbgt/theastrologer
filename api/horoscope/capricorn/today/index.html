But while those are certainly the qualities of a leader, remember that good leaders also show compassion and humility. If you make a mistake, don't be afraid to admit it. And if you hurt someone's feelings, be sure to apologize, even if you believe you're in the right.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
