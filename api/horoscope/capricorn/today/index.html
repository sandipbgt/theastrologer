    "horoscope": "Matters of the heart seem more important today than anything external like work, recognition or accomplishment. Your only duty now is to connect with the people you love. And reaching out to them isn't just for their sake. It's for yours, too. Take this opportunity to reaffirm the bonds that keep you close with family and friends. Days like this are what carry your relationships through rough spots and emotionally lean times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
