    "horoscope": "You may want to break out and show everyone how creative and ambitious you are, but today isn't right for that kind of assertiveness. Instead of taking a stand in some dramatic way, try to stay within formal boundaries today. Let other people discover your vibrant spirit on their own. That way you'll look more sincere, which will count for some big points later. Your determined energy will almost certainly shine through on its own -- there's no need to push it on anyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
