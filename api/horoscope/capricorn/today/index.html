It also helps that your energy is so deep and grounded. Your emotional fortitude and your good, strong back make it possible for you to accomplish just about anything. You can also serve as a pillar of courage for your loved ones, who may not feel as centered as you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
