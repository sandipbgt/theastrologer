    "horoscope": "Today you'll place a firm emphasis on tradition, but you're able to be easygoing about it, and that's a good thing. Of course, you're a traditional person by nature. You respect rules as well as long-standing systems and structures. And these things are even more meaningful now than usual. So use a traditional method in your work today, or practice a time-honored ritual at home or with family.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
