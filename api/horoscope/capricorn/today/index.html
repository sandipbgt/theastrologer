    "horoscope": "A reserved mood settles in today. You have a lot on your mind, but not in a bad way. In fact, the current energy is your favorite kind, because it helps you focus on the task at hand. Even problems aren't any trouble for you to manage, because you approach them more like puzzles in need of a solution. That logical perspective helps protect against getting emotionally involved, which usually just complicates things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
