    "horoscope": "It's time to rediscover old desires. Something that once drove you -- maybe a career goal, or a relationship -- comes back strong today, and it feels good. It's exciting to know the same passion still runs in your veins, and that you're as ambitious as ever. Use this extra energy burst to drive forward into something meaningful. Or you could just have a good time with friends and admirers. It's up to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
