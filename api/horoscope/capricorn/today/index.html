    "horoscope": "Some people have the wrong idea about you. You're not aloof. You're just lonely. So why don't you admit that you're human, and therefore vulnerable, and reach out to someone? Let today be your turning point. With just a simple, quick shift in your thinking, you could switch from ignoring your emotions to embracing them. Others will surely appreciate your becoming more emotionally accessible, so quickly. Of course, that's just like you. When you decide to do something, you do it well, and fast.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
