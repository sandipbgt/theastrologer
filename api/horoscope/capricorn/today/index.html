    "horoscope": "The bottom line has always been important to you. You deal in tangibles -- causes and effects as played out in the real world. You know that results are a lot more satisfying than any theory could ever be, and that's especially true right now. Plus, you're in the mood to physically enjoy yourself. So turn that practical eye toward something solid, basic, and creative, like a new investment strategy or connecting with your sweetheart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
