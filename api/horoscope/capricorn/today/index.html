Instead of trying to impress your own truths on other people today, take a more open-minded approach. Listen to your partner, neighbor or friend, even if they disagree with what you've been saying. You might find that their viewpoints hold more water than you thought. You might even have to apologize for being so quick to dismiss them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
