    "horoscope": "It's a good day to apply yourself to your work, because your focus is legendary and your energy runs smooth and deep. But make time for friends and family, too. Strengthen the emotional connection you share with someone close to you. Let them know you're thinking of them, and that all your hard work is in their name. This could turn out to be quite a sentimental day for you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
