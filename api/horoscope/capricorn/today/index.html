You have a strong work ethic, not to mention a keen sense of duty toward your family, your employer or anyone for whom you feel responsible. Today, those values may be called into question, or they might simply be on your mind. Don't be afraid to question your beliefs. This process is an important part of making sure you're living according to your ideals.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
