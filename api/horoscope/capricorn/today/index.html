Just about any opportunity you see today is a good bet, because you've done your homework. If you can be both objective and sensitive at the same time, you'll find that things turn out even better than you'd hoped. Thus, it's all right to put all your eggs in one basket for the time being. Soon you'll see what it all adds up to, and you'll know what you have to work with.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
