You might feel like retreating into your work, to forget your problems by losing yourself in the daily grind. But don't get too introverted. You could miss some important bit of insight into untangling your issues. Connecting with other people is important now, so get together with friends or family. That simple act of togetherness could really help your mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
