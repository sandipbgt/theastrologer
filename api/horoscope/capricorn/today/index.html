    "horoscope": "If you're feeling a little flat and in need of a lift today, be creative in seeking inspiration. You could visit someplace you've never been before, or talk to a person whose background is completely different from yours. It's good to open yourself up to different perspectives, especially if it makes you uncomfortable. A broad-minded attitude will keep you learning, and will help you avoid becoming inflexible or even judgmental in your thinking.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
