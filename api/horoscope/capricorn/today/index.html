This is the start of a new month-long personal cycle for you, so why not make it a good one? Set some manageable personal goals, such as spending less or eating healthy dinners every night this week. Keep track and reward yourself regularly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
