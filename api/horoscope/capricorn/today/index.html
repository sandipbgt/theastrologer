It'll certainly be the best use of your time, even if it's not the most comfortable existence you could imagine. You have no say in what others do, so try to be less overbearing. And watch the bitterness about being excluded. Be kind to yourself. Things will be different before you know it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
