Getting stuck in one perspective won't help anyone, and you could look like a snob to people you like and respect. Isn't it better to agree to disagree, at least today? You know other people's ideas are just as valid as your own. Take some time to keep reviewing the facts and going over your options. You can make figuring things out a team effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
