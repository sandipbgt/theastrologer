    "horoscope": "Work on something with careful dedication, and you'll make a favorable impression. Hard questions don't daunt you now, making people appreciate that solid core of yours even more. Your intentions are as honorable as always, and that's clear to everyone. Today, you might even bump into someone who really understands you. Wouldn't that be fun? A word of caution, however: Even if an enticing new job or relationship beckons, give it a few days to develop. You still have some loose ends to tie up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
