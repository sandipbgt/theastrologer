    "horoscope": "You want everyone to know what a great job you're doing, but at the same time, you're worried someone will criticize your efforts. Deep down, you're worried that you'll deserve their criticism. Go easy on yourself today. You've put in the work and done a good job, and you should feel proud. But also be open to learning from feedback. That could be the most valuable thing you get from this experience.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
