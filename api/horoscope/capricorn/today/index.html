    "horoscope": "Dig into your work today. You're intensely focused, and no detail slips past you. Of course, you always do a thorough job, no matter what project lies on your plate, but today you can really delve deeply into something. Losing yourself in your work can be a freeing experience. And it's certainly a good distraction from any moodiness you're feeling or emotional issues you may be facing in your personal life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
