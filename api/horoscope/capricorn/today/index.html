    "horoscope": "That inner genii is brewing up some heavy weather. If you can't handle the pressure, you may have to let your stormy side out of the bottle. Show some backbone instead of erupting into a formless blob of angst. Go straight for the truth so that you can make your stand from solid ground, and attack from a good position.

But if you really want to get somewhere and things are blocking you, this is the best way to knock those obstacles down.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
