    "horoscope": "Your approach to life today is solid and thorough, if a bit uninspired. Traditional approaches to problem-solving appeal to you even more than usual, because you have long-term security in mind, and you just don't trust any methods that aren't tried and true. No, you may not shine today as an innovative thinker -- but you've got something better to offer: common sense and a splendid work ethic.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
