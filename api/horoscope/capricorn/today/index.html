    "horoscope": "Your work and reputation are very important to you, but sometimes you try too hard to serve this area of your life. Your personal relationships are equally important, so put some time and effort into them today. Relax with your spouse, family or friends, and keep yourself from glancing at the clock every few minutes! Your work can wait, Capricorn. Today is for making affectionate connections with the people you care about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
