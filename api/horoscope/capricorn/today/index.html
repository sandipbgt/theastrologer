    "horoscope": "For many people, life could get emotionally intense today. But while some are caught up in interpersonal dramas -- situations of jealousy, suspicion, manipulation and possessiveness -- you're above the fray. It's not that you're unaffected by the current influence; your experience of life is deeper than usual, too. But you're tapped into the positive side of this energy. Share affectionate moments with your loved ones. Reaffirm those close bonds.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
