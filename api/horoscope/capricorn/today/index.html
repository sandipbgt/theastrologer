    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic influence puts a spotlight on your partnerships, both personal and professional ones. It's especially important now to get along, even if that means bending over backward to let the other person have their way. You're a natural leader, so it can be difficult for you to step aside and share responsibility, or authority in general. Consider today a positive lesson in developing your collaborative skills.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
