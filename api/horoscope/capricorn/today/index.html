It's a great time for it, and you certainly have great talents and skills to bring to the mix. Your leadership abilities come in handy when it's time to marshal the troops. And your insistence on managing resources carefully will help keep everyone in line. You can learn a lot from others, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
