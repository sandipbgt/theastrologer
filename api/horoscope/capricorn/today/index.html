    "horoscope": "Think about what used to make your pulse pound. How much of that still works for you? It's easy to forget what's important when temptation waves seductively just beyond your reach. Stay faithful to those old ideals as you chase your latest ambitions. And don't worry, it doesn't have to be one or the other. Success isn't playing favorites as long as you meet the necessary requirements. You can have it all if you play your cards right. Just deal fairly where others are concerned. You're stuck in this game with them for today, if not longer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
