    "horoscope": "Your compassion is aroused today. If you see someone in need of help or support, you'll jump right in and lend a hand. Normally, you might not do this, purely out of practicality: You might consider whether you can really afford the time it would take to help out, and then the moment is gone. Now you're eager to help. You're in such a good space, there's no fear of overextending yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
