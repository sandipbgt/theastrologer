    "horoscope": "Caution runs through you like a band of steel. This innate sense of prudence keeps you on the straight and narrow. You rarely make missteps because you plan every move so carefully. And this is especially true today. The current influence has you calculating your future like a mathematician. Just don't forget that you can calculate for risk, too. Sometimes the best moves are the ones that are just a little bit daring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
