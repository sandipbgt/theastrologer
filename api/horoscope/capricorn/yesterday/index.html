    "horoscope": "You've never been one for a lot of fuss and drama. You far prefer a nice, orderly reality. You're also experienced enough to know that complicated people can mess things up. If that happens today, remember you have the patience to handle it. You're as focused as ever, and a strong sense of self-confidence will help you push through any obstacles or delays that pop up. And hey -- it's these little snafus that keep life interesting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
