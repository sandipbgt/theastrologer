    "horoscope": "You possess a strong sense of self today. Your courage is high, but so is your compassion. This creates an incredibly powerful combination you can draw from in any endeavor you might undertake, whether it's a professional pursuit or something more personal. It's a good time for everything from having a difficult heart-to-heart talk with a friend to proving yourself at work through sheer focus and effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
