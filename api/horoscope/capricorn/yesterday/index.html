    "horoscope": "If your energy is a bit low today, don't push yourself to work as hard as you usually do. You often ignore your body's cues in favor of sticking to your task list. But right now it's a good idea to make space in your schedule for some pleasurable relaxation. Grab a friend or a family member and camp out on the couch. Watch a movie or read a good book. Enjoy some downtime.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
