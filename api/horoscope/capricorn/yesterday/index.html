    "horoscope": "Work takes center stage today. And you're quite the workhorse now! You're capable of tremendous effort, as long as you can see a reason for your actions. A basic feeling of obligation is probably reason enough! Just make sure you don't limit yourself unnecessarily. It's a point of honor for you to live up to your responsibilities, but there's nothing wrong with honoring your own needs and goals, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
