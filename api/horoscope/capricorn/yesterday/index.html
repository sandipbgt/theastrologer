    "horoscope": "Being goal-oriented is a natural part of you, but don't forget the importance of charity today. You can afford to share the wealth. Think of it as credit in your karmic bank account: Put some effort into caring for someone else, and your own life is sure to be enriched. Help others, and they'll help you -- a clear win-win situation. Be forewarned, though: This may mean offering a shoulder to someone who's sad, or listening as a friend spills out their feelings. Emotions have never been your strong point, but if anyone can learn this, it's you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
