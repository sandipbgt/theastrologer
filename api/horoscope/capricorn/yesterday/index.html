Most people don't expect this from you, so your deadpan humor might go unnoticed -- which is too bad, because people who aren't paying attention are missing out on something special. You have a way of imparting serious truths in a humorous way. Somehow, they're easier to swallow that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
