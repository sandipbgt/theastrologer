    "horoscope": "You feel distinctly perturbed today. What's got you all in a tizzy, anyway? It may stem from real challenges in your daily life, but most likely it's just a bad mood that's taken hold of you. Either way, you could get up in people's faces now, almost as if you crave conflict. If you'd rather avoid pointless discord, spend some time at the gym or out on the trail, working up a sweat. And hold your tongue when you're feeling irritated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
