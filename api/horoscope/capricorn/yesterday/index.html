    "horoscope": "Today's energy is perfect for reintroducing balance to any area of your life that has gotten off track. If you've spent too much money, neglected your family in favor of work, or slacked off on regular exercise, now you can correct the imbalance. This is a good reminder for you, since you sometimes forget that life should be about give and take: a little work, a little play; exercise and relaxation; yin and yang.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
