    "horoscope": "Your sense of ambition rises today likeinside a thermometer. Suddenly, your goals are not only clear in your mind, they're incredibly important, as if your life and ego are riding solely on them. You can be a pretty ruthless competitor in any situation, whether you're in the business world or just playing a game with friends. Do your best to steer clear of outright competition, especially in situations where positive impressions count!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
