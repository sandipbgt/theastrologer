You're like a master craftsman -- someone who has practiced and perfected their trade. This polish is evident in every last detail. And the more you concentrate, the truer that becomes. Put your whole focus and attention into an important project, and the results will speak for themselves.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
