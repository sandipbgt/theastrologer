    "horoscope": "Feeling a little competitive today, are we? Or maybe a lot! The current energy gets under your skin, where it starts a little internal. It pushes you to do and be your best. Nothing wrong there. You have a lot of talent, and you've worked hard to develop your skills. The only problems may come from being overly aggressive when it isn't necessary. Remember, there's a difference between assertiveness and belligerence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
