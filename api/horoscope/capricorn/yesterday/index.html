    "horoscope": "Think like a scientist today. Embrace abstract concepts. Just because you can't measure them doesn't mean they have no worth. Under the current energy, following a path of inquiry is as simple as asking yourself, 'What if?' Then reason through the answers that present themselves to you -- even the wild ones. Now you're taking a scholarly approach to life, and you'll come through this with greater knowledge about the subject you've been exploring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
