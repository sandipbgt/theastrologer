    "horoscope": "Don't complain about what you can't change, because you probably actually can change it. And don't spend today playing politics or trying to score extra points. There's an even better way to move yourself along: Just do your job and do it well. Push and stretch further than you usually do, and leave no stone unturned. You can accomplish great things if you use your natural talents, and you're smart enough to know that if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. Best of all, you're savvy enough to know how to do all the right things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
