    "horoscope": "Trivial things might worry you today. Frustration will either leave you brooding in silence or mouthing off to someone you'd normally respect. Then there's the fine art of complaining. This could be a healthy outlet for you but may also color you as a whiner that others would rather avoid. Before you choose one of these grim destinations, understand there's actually no need for any of this. Happiness is just over the tight horizon that seems to be hemming you in. Why not step out of your little frame? There's a bigger picture out there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
