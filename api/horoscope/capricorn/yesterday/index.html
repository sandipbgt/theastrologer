    "horoscope": "The world might seem to churn around you today, but you'll stay grounded and consistent. You're ambitious by nature, and now your goals are even more important to you than usual, especially when they're founded in love. Love for your family, the life you're building, the future you've envisioned so many times. You're dedicated to becoming the person you know you are inside. This strengthens you on the outside, and in the eyes of others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
