    "horoscope": "Your ambitious streak takes center stage today. This can be a good thing if you're pushing toward a goal that's going to be difficult to reach. But watch out for how you come across to others. Pushy behavior is sure to be met with the same -- meaning, you can create problems where none existed, simply by being overly aggressive. You'll win others' support if you stay kind and gracious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
