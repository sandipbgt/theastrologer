Or, just accept your distant feelings. Know who you are. Phony attempts at warmth won't convince anyone, least of all the people who know you. Be true to yourself, whatever your feelings may be. There's nothing wrong with keeping your hands to yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
