You aren't distracted now, so you can get quite a lot done. But don't overwork yourself. That's a danger today. If everyone else has left the office early but you're still there working alone in your cubicle, it's time to log off and head home.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
