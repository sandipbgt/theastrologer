    "horoscope": "Today could be an emotional day for many people. A consistent approach is best in everything you do now, including work, parenting and relationships. Good thing consistency is one of your strong points! It's easy for you to take maximum advantage of the current lunar energy, and use it for good in your life. You're also a strong, stable role model for others, who see you as a calm harbor in a storm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
