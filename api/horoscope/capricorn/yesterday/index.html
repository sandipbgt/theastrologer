    "horoscope": "Your natural instinct is to care for others in substantive, measurable ways, such as working hard for a decent paycheck for your family. But today, it's all about making emotional connections. You're feeling soft and open, so time spent with loved ones is very special now. Alone time is good, too, especially if you pamper yourself in some way. Watch a movie or take a nap. Just for today, don't push yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
