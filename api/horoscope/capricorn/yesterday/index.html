    "horoscope": "Are you having a hard time hitting the right notes with friends and coworkers? Communication seems trickier than usual -- you think you're being witty, but no one's laughing. Or maybe you're only trying to be direct, but coming across as aggressive. Either way, it's hard to find common ground with others today, and your random actions and salty outbursts aren't helping. This might be one of those times when it's best to work on your own as much as possible while you wait for your usual, sensible self to reemerge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
