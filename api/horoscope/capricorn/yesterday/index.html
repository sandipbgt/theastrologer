    "horoscope": "Watch your manners today. Whether you're at home, at work or among a group of friends, make sure you're as calm and agreeable as possible. It's easy to get caught up in the moment, especially when you're focused and working hard. In those moments you might snap at someone or issue a brusque order, without considering how you're coming across. Today it's best to be gentle and kind, even when you're being firm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
