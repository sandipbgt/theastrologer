    "horoscope": "Look sharp today for strategies that save time and energy. You appreciate anything that lets you fit more activities into a given space of time, because you have a lot to accomplish. Work hard and apply yourself to the task at hand, but don't wear yourself out! Make sure your objectives are realistic. Ambition is a positive quality, but not if you push it too far or place too much importance on it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
