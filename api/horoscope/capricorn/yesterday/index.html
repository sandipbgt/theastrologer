Sure, you still have a ways to go, but that's who you are at your core, and what you're all about: You set goals and then you take the necessary steps to achieve them. It's okay to take a day off now and then to enjoy the fruits of your efforts. At least pat yourself on the back today for all your hard work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
