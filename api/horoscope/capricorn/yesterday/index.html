    "horoscope": "Today you're able to deal with life on your favorite terms: the real, the measurable and the actual. Everything you do has a process, and if it doesn't, you'll establish one as you go along. If you're making plans for the future, they're sure to be solid, because they take into account not only your hopes and ambitions but also your limitations. Knowing what you can't do alone is important in gathering the right resources.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
