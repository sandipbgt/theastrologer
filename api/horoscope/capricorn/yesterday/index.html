    "horoscope": "It seems extra important today to get credit for your work or accomplishments. But bragging is less impressive than simply letting your work speak for itself. If people don't notice what a good job you've done today, trust that they soon will. Just keep applying yourself, like always. Keep your ambitions in mind, but be flexible about them. You may have to tweak them in order to make them workable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
