    "horoscope": "Today's events will require quick thinking and flexibility -- neither of which may be your strong point. You prefer to think through a problem carefully before you act. And the idea of stepping outside the comfort of rules and routines might make you positively itchy! Still, try to view the current influence an interesting challenge, and do your best to go with the flow. This could be a great lesson in staying on your toes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
