    "horoscope": "Oh, you're so difficult. You'll give your opinion whenever possible and take the opposing point of view today, just because. Do you actually disagree with people? Are you just playing devil's advocate for the fun of it? At the same time, don't go around suppressing those who disagree with you. Don't pout when someone else dares to step onstage.
