But for today, most of those very same people would prefer simple competence over anything so flashy as excellence. The thing that will impress them most at the moment is simple hard work, and the ability to finish a project well. Try not to let your vitality outshine everyone else's combined light. And don't worry: You'll have plenty more opportunities to excel.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
