    "horoscope": "Your friends are a weird, wonderful bunch, aren't they? They continually challenge you -- to think more broadly, to lighten up, to laugh. But sometimes, like today, their antics actually make you a little uncomfortable. This is a good chance to focus on tolerance and acceptance. It's a big, wide world out there. Sometimes you wish things could be a little more normal, but where's the fun in that? Challenge yourself to embrace everything unique.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
