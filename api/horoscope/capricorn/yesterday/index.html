You're a bit emotionally sensitive now, so putting yourself in new situations or surroundings will only cause you stress. If you have to be away from home, stay in close touch. Call your family on the phone, or trade emails with close friends. Even just checking in to say hello will reassure you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
