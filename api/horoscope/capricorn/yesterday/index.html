    "horoscope": "What's up with you, anyway? Your inner teenager has come to the fore, and this kid's going to stick around today. You might be irresponsible and sulky, especially with the people you know best, since around them you can let your guard down. If you find yourself acting like a growly bear, try humor  -- watch a funny movie, or enjoy a friend's joke. A little laughter should loosen you right up -- especially if it's directed at yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
