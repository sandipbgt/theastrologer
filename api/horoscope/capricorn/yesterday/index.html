    "horoscope": "Exactly why are you so strict with others? Is this about the vanity of your high expectations or maybe the fear of being left out of their plans? Nobody needs this much drama in their lives, not even you. Let people be themselves today. You'll probably like them better, and you'll see a faster payoff, too. But don't get too focused on the money or the gifts. What you really need most is the common currency of everyday give-and-take. Because when you have your peace of mind, you have everything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
