    "horoscope": "Today you're more aware than usual of your own inner strength. You might have a chance to give emotional support to a friend. Being there for them feels great. Giving solid advice helps you realize what a good life you've built for yourself. Other people see you this way already. But it's nice to get this glimpse of it yourself. Now you can move forward with a deep sense of inner pride.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
