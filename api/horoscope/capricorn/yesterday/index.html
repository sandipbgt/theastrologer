You're just making some kind of transition or bridging a gap. Be sure you have all the facts, and then weigh the pros and cons. Balance everything, even if that means a heavy compromise to make up for somebody else's flimsy excuse. Perform to the best of your abilities, no matter how much or little cooperation you get. And put any shopping sprees on hold so that you won't spend more than you actually have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
