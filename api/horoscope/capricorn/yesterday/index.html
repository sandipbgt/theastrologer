This makes it a lot harder to put your foot down without second-guessing yourself. If you have to decide soon, try to do what you know is right. Otherwise, keep an open dialogue with other people. See if you can find a way to accommodate everyone's wishes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
