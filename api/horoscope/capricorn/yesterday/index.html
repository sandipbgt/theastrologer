    "horoscope": "You'll feel uptight today, anxious tomorrow and puzzled that everything seems to happen to you. You might lash out to attack and suddenly find yourself in retreat when your target strikes back even harder. You have a lot of nerve, but don't be insulted by that. Risk-takers actually have a good thing going if they'd only use that nerve the right way. Dare to think positively. Meet the challenge of making yourself comfortable in this world. You do have to live here, you know. Find a way to live here peacefully yet on your terms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
