    "horoscope": "Hey, check you out! Make your debut while you're hot. Amaze them with your moves. Impress them with your calm and absolute certainty. You know when to hold back and when to pull out all the stops, and you're so responsible that nobody's going to get hurt. Today our style will define you to those who don't know you as a person. And don't worry if it's a tough crowd, either. They'll still end up respecting you. Maybe you'll even part as friends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
