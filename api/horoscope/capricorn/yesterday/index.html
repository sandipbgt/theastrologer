    "horoscope": "Your mind is strong and analytical today. If you have a lot of responsibilities on your plate, it's no problem. Even juggling errands with work and family is no trouble. Crossing items off your task list brings you a sense of personal accomplishment. Be sure to emphasize logic and efficiency in everything you do -- except connecting with loved ones. That's one activity that's better when it comes from your heart instead of your head.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
