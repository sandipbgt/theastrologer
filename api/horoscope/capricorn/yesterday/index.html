    "horoscope": "Don't let yourself get sucked into power games today. It's all too easy now to believe that professional or social status matters far more than it really does. What's much more fulfilling is building your personal connections with family and friends. Spend time with loved ones today. Laugh, talk and share warm hugs. This will do so much more for your self-confidence than climbing that social or career ladder ever could.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
