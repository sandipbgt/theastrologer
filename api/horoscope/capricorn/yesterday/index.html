    "horoscope": "There's a relaxed, passive influence at work today. Some people aren't as decisive as they should be. This probably isn't an issue for you, of course. You're used to taking the lead. But even if you perceive the need for someone to step in and take charge, hang back. See if the group can work together as cooperating equals. That's what is most favored today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
