Something within you is craving others' attention, affection or approval. If you can admit to that feeling within yourself, you can be much more direct about having it satisfied by someone who cares about you. And that will be so much more fulfilling in the long run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
