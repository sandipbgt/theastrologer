    "horoscope": "Your work goes smoothly today. Tasks you perform at home go well, too. You're efficient in your movements, and gracefully so. This has positive effects beyond the immediately obvious ones. Working calmly and carefully spreads good energy outward, like ripples in a pond. You're setting a good example for your children or your coworkers. Your actions might inspire them to be more thorough and practical in their own affairs.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
