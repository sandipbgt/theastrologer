    "horoscope": "A romantic mood settles in today. It's as if you're wearing the proverbial rose-colored glasses -- and yet, this is a good thing. Taking a soft-edged, rosy view of life isn't silly or weak. It's valiant. Without idealism, no one would be able to envision their heart's desire, or the perfect life for them. Even if your head is in the clouds, you can lead the way in demonstrating the power of wishful thinking.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
