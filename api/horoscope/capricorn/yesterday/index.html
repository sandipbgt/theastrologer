    "horoscope": "Pay special attention to your partnerships today. It's important now to make sure there's an equal exchange of responsibility and respect between you and your spouse or someone you work with. Any imbalances should be corrected, so that your relationship can move forward in a functional, mutually beneficial way. If there's an imbalance of power, or a lack of courtesy, cracks in your connection will begin to show.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
