    "horoscope": "Your mood takes a slight downturn as a vague uneasiness sets in. But don't worry -- you're great at putting up a good front when you're feeling strained and insecure. That strut of yours looks spontaneous to everyone else, even if you know what's beneath it. 'Fake it till you make it' is a pretty good credo to live by right now. After all, you've planned several changes, and you're too careful to have made any real blunders. So relax. Be confident that things will go through as scheduled.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
