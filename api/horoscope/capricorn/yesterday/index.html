If so, other people will probably appreciate your willingness to take that on, since leading a group can be hard work! You have to balance out so many differing opinions and needs. Do your best to create that balance, and avoid resorting to a more authoritarian approach.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
