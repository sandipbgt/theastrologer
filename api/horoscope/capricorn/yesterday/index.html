    "horoscope": "Security is one of your chief concerns,, so the anxious feeling permeating this day is troublesome. It's hard to trust others at the moment. You might slip into an isolated mode, believing that if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. If you have family or employees depending on you, watch that you don't start issuing orders like a tyrant. That kind of behavior is just unnecessary. This is simply an uneasy mood you're in, and it will pass within a day. Stay calm. Try to have some fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
