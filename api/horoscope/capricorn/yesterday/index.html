Even if you're worried about work or finances, it's easy enough to identify ways to strengthen things for the future. Remember that systems and structures are important today. That means follow the rules in everything you do. Cutting corners would only mean having to redo something later. But then, taking shortcuts isn't really your style, anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
