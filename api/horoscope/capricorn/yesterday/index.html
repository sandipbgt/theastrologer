    "horoscope": "It's a good day for creating positive transformation. You're feeling innovative, so take a keen-eyed look at the systems in your life. Is there something about a certain project or arrangement you've set up that isn't working as well as it should? If so, view it critically. What could you change? Even if an idea seems impractical, don't disregard it. Consider everything until you have reason to narrow down your options.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
