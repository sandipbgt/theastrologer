    "horoscope": "You're feeling disgruntled. A close relationship seems a little rocky now, and you're in no mood to adjust your behavior in deference to someone else. But inflexibility only hurts you in the long run. Relationships are about both people involved, so if you're stubbornly clinging to your own viewpoint, you're sending the message that you don't care about the other person's feelings. Try a different tack, like smiling and charming your way out of this. It's sure to be more effective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
