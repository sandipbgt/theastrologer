    "horoscope": "Dealing with tricky situations at home or with a partner feels, well, tricky. It's draining to try to accommodate all the different opinions, ideas, and needs.

The even better news is that you can speed the process -- by listening, rather than just pushing your own agenda.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
