You probably don't realize how detached you seem right now, because you're in a good mood and you're absorbed in your work, or in a particular idea that has caught your interest. But make a little time for human interaction, too. You might feel like being independent right now, but the people who love you miss your company.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
