    "horoscope": "It doesn't matter who crosses your path, gets in your face or reaches out to you. You'll probably be suspicious about their motives. Are they scamming you? Setting you up for a joke? Maybe they're just trying to understand you, because you're being pretty unclear about your own motives. It's natural to retreat if you're confused. It's easier to go around in circles churning up old mud instead of going out to break new ground. The danger is that you might get stuck in this quicksand. The best way out is not even getting in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
