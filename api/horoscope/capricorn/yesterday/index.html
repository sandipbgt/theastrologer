But the other person deserves to have things their way, too. Sometimes, you just have to make a few concessions. Instead of issuing commands and ultimatums, you could try simply living gracefully with the disappointment, and quickly move on. You'll get your way soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
