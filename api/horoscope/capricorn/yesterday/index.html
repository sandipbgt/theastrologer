    "horoscope": "Your refined taste and meticulous style have always been impressive. You have a nose for the finest materials, the purest ingredients, and the loftiest intentions. It's only right, then, that other people are starting to appreciate your taste. And now you have luck on your side, too. In fact, it's almost as if you can do no wrong -- take advantage of it, as long as it lasts, and put your discriminating eye toward something meaningful for your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
