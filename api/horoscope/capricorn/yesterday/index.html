    "horoscope": "You crave alternatives, whether you actually want a choice or are just looking for an excuse to slip away. You might get a little testy when others offer you the wrong thing. Can't they read your mind? Didn't you post your likes and dislikes all over your web site? Maybe someone's attitude bothers you. Maybe you feel wronged and need revenge. A day of low-level conflict, though unwelcome, might be necessary. It's a question of winning what you want, getting what you deserve, or dealing with whatever the universe dumps on your plate. You'll learn something in the end.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
