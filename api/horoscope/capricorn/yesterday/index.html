You're feeling pressured by work, health issues, and other weighty problems, but that's no excuse to drop out of your daily duties -- or your usual pleasures. You should still reach out to your loved ones, and don't shortchange your own health. If you have to get up an hour earlier to work out, so be it. Eating healthy and getting plenty of rest will also help ease you through this period.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
