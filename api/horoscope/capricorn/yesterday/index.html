    "horoscope": "That stubbornness you're famous for might actually be a virtue now. It'll get you through today, anyway, and that's saying a lot, because this probably won't be the easiest, most lighthearted day of your life. You're likely to face challenges at work and at home, and you'll need that strong will of yours to help you shove through tight spots. You'll also need your most diplomatic, tactful side as well. Remember, revenge won't help your noble cause.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
