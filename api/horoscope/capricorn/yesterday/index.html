Under the current scattered energy, it's all too easy to go completely overboard with your anxieties. A much better alternative? Use this day to relax in any way you can. Take naps; walk the dogs; go golfing or boating. Play a video game. Read a book. Whatever you do, as long as it soothes your soul and keeps you grounded in the present, it will do you a world of good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
