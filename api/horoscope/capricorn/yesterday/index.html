    "horoscope": "Whether you're folding laundry, playing basketball or working at the office today, your energy stays grounded and you're capable of steady output. But don't limit yourself to hard work. It's important to relax now, too, especially in the company of people you love. Share a meal with your family and chat about your day. Watch a movie with your spouse, and hold hands throughout the show. Simple pleasures count for a lot now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
