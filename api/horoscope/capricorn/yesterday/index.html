    "horoscope": "Your dependable nature comes in handy today. Your community -- whether that means your family, coworkers or friends -- relies on you a great deal. You certainly aren't going to let them down now. You can be a calm, effective leader, especially if you're willing to test out new ideas. You tend to avoid unnecessary risks, but follow your instincts today if you sense that a bold move might pay off.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
