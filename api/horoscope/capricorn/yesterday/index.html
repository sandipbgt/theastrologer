You may find yourself boasting about your accomplishments, building yourself up to someone -- as if you aren't impressive enough just as you are. People can tell how intelligent and capable you are just by speaking with you. And your achievements speak for themselves. So relax and enjoy today's warm, friendly vibe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
