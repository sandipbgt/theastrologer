    "horoscope": "Work goes well today. You're efficient and methodical, and moving through your to-do list feels like therapy. With every item you cross off your agenda, a bit of weight is lifted off your shoulders. This is a great day for making plans for the future, because you have a solid sense of what is and isn't possible. It's easy for you to accept reality, which means you can think creatively within its walls.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
