    "horoscope": "Everyone around you is in a warm, playful mood, but you're feeling a bit left out. If there's a lot on your to-do list, you won't feel comfortable sharing a laugh with your coworkers.

You do have incredible stamina now, so your efforts will go far.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
