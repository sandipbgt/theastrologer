Your curious side comes out today, triggered by something as simple as someone's casual comment or an interesting news story. Even if you're already an expert, don't be hasty or arrogant. See if you can learn something new. This opportunity could be a growth experience, and growth takes time. Savor this lesson. And don't insist on immediate answers. They'll come soon enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
