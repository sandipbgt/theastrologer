    "horoscope": "The intensity of life ramps up today. You may feel more closely connected with the people you love, and in need of their attention. You also might feel more ambitious than usual. Your goals seem more near and dear to your heart, so you're more willing to do whatever it takes to reach them. This is all about creating the life you desire -- the life you've envisioned for yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
