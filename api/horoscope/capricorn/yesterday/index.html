    "horoscope": "Unfortunately, in times of stress, you tend to cling to the status quo. You'd almost rather stay in a rut than find a way out. But if you're feeling stuck and frustrated today, don't make it worse by refusing to consider alternative solutions. You're actually feeling disconnected from your own passion, whether that's passion toward your honey, your work, or life itself. It's time to reconnect with that sense of excitement. You can do it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
