    "horoscope": "Your usual, sober attitude lightens up today. You see the humor in life. Little things please you: a child acting playful, a dog wagging its tail, or a beautiful mural along your commute to work. Let your mind roam today. Appreciate people and ideas you might normally discount. This is all about opening yourself up to new influences, and seeing how you feel about them. You might be pleasantly surprised.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
