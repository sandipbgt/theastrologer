That's fine -- you're coming up with plenty of zany, out-there ideas that just might work -- but today should be about mingling with the masses, too. Talking about your work with other people could open up whole new avenues of thought you haven't even considered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
