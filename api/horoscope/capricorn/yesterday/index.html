    "horoscope": "Expect a moody day today. If things turn out smooth and lighthearted, you'll be pleasantly surprised. But you're probably feeling more emotional than usual, along with the rest of the world. Your family members or coworkers may seem a little stirred up -- perhaps, in your opinion, over nothing. Even if you feel that someone is being overly dramatic, treat their feelings as valid. It's especially important right now to be caring and kind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
