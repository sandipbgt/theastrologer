Of course, you might turn your back on such things, especially if you have a lot of work to do. You don't have time to be so frivolous, right? But there's so much fun to be had right now, mingling with other people. Talk business for a few minutes and you can call it productive as well as enjoyable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
