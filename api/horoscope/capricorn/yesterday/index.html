    "horoscope": "You're in a sober mind frame today, so work and other responsibilities are on your mind. Just keep your sense of humor about you. It's great to get deeply absorbed in your work, especially if you're interested in the actual substance of it -- not just the paycheck it brings. Similarly, it's important to live up to your familial duties. Do so from a place of love, not obligation. Prioritize your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
