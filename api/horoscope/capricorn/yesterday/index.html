    "horoscope": "You're charging ahead with some plan or venture, and you're feeling strong. But you should slow down for a moment and take a closer look. It seems that others are cooperating, but it's likely that they're doing so grudgingly at best. And though this may feel like a blow to you, you should hear them out. You're better off working out the kinks now instead of waiting till later, when the whole situation is more complicated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
