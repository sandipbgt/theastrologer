    "horoscope": "Deep down, you're experiencing some worries that you haven't acknowledged or processed yet, and they're making you a bit defensive today. But the people who know you best will see through your moody behavior to the anxiety that lies beneath. There's no point in pretending you're fine if you aren't. In fact, opening up about your worries will make you feel better, in part because it will remind you that you can lean on your friends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
