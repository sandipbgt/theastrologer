You may not often experience such intensity, such intimacy and desire. It's probably obvious that the current influence is great for romantic relationships. But really, it's perfect for any connection with someone you care deeply about. Let them know your feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
