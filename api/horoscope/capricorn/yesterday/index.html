    "horoscope": "Take life a little more slowly today than usual. Holing up in front of your computer isn't nearly as satisfying as spending time with your family or friends -- the people you know and love best. This is one of those days when it's really important to reach out to the people in your life and let them know you're thinking of them. Be warm and affectionate. Send a message with a hug or a smile.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
