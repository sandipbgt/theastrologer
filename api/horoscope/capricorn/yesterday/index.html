    "horoscope": "You're in a sympathetic mood today, and compassion comes more easily than usual. You may find yourself being more lenient in your expectations of yourself or other people.

Take some time off for rest and relaxation, if you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
