Now you can take what's good from the past and use it to catapult into the future. You've always worked hard to overcome your obstacles, but with your ambition, hard work and dedication, you can get further with this than anyone else -- which is why you're so often ahead of your time!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
