    "horoscope": "When you're ticking items off your agenda, consider which of your many versatile skills you'll really need, and which you can table. There's a lot to be said for conserving energy whenever possible. Today won't really demand much of you. Instead of throwing your energy into every project and relationship in your life, why not save your more impressive displays for more interesting times? Take care of business and enjoy some downtime. Then you'll be ready to pull out all the stops when it counts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
