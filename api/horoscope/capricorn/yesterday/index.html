There are a couple of ways you can handle this. You could let your inner nervousness build as you act aloof and cranky while you try to figure it out yourself. Or you could stay calm and ask for help. There's got to be an ally who can help you out, even with just a bit of fresh perspective. Ask and see.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
