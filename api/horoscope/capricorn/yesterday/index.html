    "horoscope": "Your spirits might be high today, and your ego is certainly robust -- so much so that a change of plans could end up bursting your bubble and ruining your entire day. But you don't have to let that happen. Just be flexible when plans or objectives shift. Take it as a challenge -- you're used to planning carefully and following those plans to a T, but days like this give you a chance to think creatively.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
