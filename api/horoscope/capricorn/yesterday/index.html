    "horoscope": "The people around you may be feeling emotionally vulnerable today. You, on the other hand, are in a wonderfully centered, grounded space. This enables you to serve as someone's rock -- a safe haven for your loved ones. You can be the voice of reason even as you acknowledge and validate their emotions. That's the best way to handle someone who is upset, you know: Let them know that you respect their feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
