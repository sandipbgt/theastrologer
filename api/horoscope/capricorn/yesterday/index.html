Maybe that's why you're so quick to conclude they're holding out on you -- because you're holding out on them. But this is just stirring up conflict. It would be a lot better to be open, accepting and aboveboard.  Any secrets are sure to come out sooner or later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
