    "horoscope": "Today you may be aloof around your friends. And if anyone dares to criticize you, you certainly don't plan to do them any favors. You keep saying everything's 'just fine' as you drive, white-knuckled, down the road of life. Why are you keeping such an iron grip on your reality? Dare yourself to take a deep breath. You won't crack your armor or drown. Give yourself permission to blink. There's no laughter or lost business, is there? Shift position. Unwind. Things will get better. Hey, maybe things already are better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
