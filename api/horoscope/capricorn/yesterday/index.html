You may have a personally meaningful goal in mind, but it's extra important now to set aside your own concerns for the good of the group. This applies at home as well as the office. Good thing you're self-disciplined. This makes it easier to work with your team, even when you'd rather strike out and do your own thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
