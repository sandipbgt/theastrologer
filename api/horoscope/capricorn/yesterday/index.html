    "horoscope": "Today you crave someone's recognition -- perhaps that of your boss or a potential new client. You're working hard to prove just how much you're capable of doing, and your output is likely to be very impressive now. There's a steady, enduring vibe affecting you today, which you can capitalize upon. But try to tap into the warmth and charm of the day, too. That will make you even more impressive to others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
