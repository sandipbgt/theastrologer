    "horoscope": "Why keep raising the stakes or making each little thing an executive decision? Why go from uneasy to unwilling to unhinged? When every choice looks like a crisis, you know you've backed yourself into a corner. Old concerns seem foolish now, yet still you long for the good old days when those things were such a big deal. Forget all that for now, because the only way out is up. Rise above your circumstances. Think less about yourself for a while. All it takes is a little distance, and you'll be able to relax again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
