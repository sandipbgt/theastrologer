When it comes to improving your outlook, that works better than almost anything. Gather everyone together for a big meal or an evening of board games. You'll find yourself unwinding as the laughter and conversation flow. Why? Because you'll be reminded that life is still bountiful, and you are still blessed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
