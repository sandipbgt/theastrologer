    "horoscope": "Your self-discipline is on high today, which makes it a great day to get a lot of work accomplished. But reserve some time for your personal relationships, too. A love affair can be a source of great self-revelation today. So can a visit to your therapist, or a heart-to-heart talk with a good friend. Work and goals are important, but developing self-awareness is even more so.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
