    "horoscope": "Instead of sticking with rules and tradition today, find some way to strike out into unknown territory. This could be geographical territory, but it's even better if it's intellectual in nature. Outside-the-box thinking reaps great rewards now. Take chances, but only well-calculated and carefully planned ones, of course. Get big and bold in your brainstorming. Don't limit yourself with concerns about the past. It's a new day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
