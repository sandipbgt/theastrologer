Do your best to keep things lighthearted by communicating consciously. You're a thinker by nature, and you possess a solid sense of logic. Still, be gentle and accommodating with others, even when you know they're incorrect about something, or you feel they're wasting the group's time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
