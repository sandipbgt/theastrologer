    "horoscope": "Today, your past may come up in some way. Perhaps an old memory resurfaces, and suddenly you're swamped with emotion. Or maybe an old friend contacts you out of the blue. The feelings that arise with these experiences are likely to be powerful. Your instinct may be to push them aside and proceed as if everything is normal. But facing tough feelings is the best way to process them, so they can evaporate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
