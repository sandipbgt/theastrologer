    "horoscope": "You're in your element today -- calm, grounded and in charge. You can set a good example for other people by keeping a good attitude about following rules or sticking to routines. Others may not be as willing as you are to toe that line. Of course, you get a lot of comfort from working within boundaries that you understand. Living up to expectations brings you an important sense of pride.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
