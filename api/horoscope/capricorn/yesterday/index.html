If a cranky mood sets in today -- if you find yourself snapping at someone for no good reason, or withdrawing from your usual group of friends -- look within yourself. What are you worried about that you haven't faced yet? If you start to recognize your insecurities, you can begin to process them, and you'll feel more in control once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
