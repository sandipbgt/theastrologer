    "horoscope": "You can withstand a lot of pressure. Abuse rolls right off you instead of rolling over you. You can do much more than you're doing now, and it wouldn't cost anything extra. Today will be busy with opportunities. The days and weeks after that might be pretty good, too. Who else says when enough's enough? Nobody, that's who. It's your moment to redefine the limits. And as far as you're concerned, it's all uphill from here. You look forward to poking your head through the clouds and greeting the stars.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
