    "horoscope": "Respect what others call holy or authentic, even if your inner voice tells you they're trying to scam you or just deluding themselves. But along with giving them your respect, it wouldn't hurt to look beyond or behind what they say. Maybe you'll get a better idea about what they're thinking and what unseen forces are at work here. Keep these investigations within the realm of peaceful curiosity, because you're really not trying to make trouble. You can learn a lot about your world today, and maybe then you'll be better qualified to judge, or even see that judgment is meaningless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
