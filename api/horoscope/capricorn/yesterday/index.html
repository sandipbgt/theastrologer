    "horoscope": "A gloomy mood might set in today, spoiling your self-confidence. Suddenly, you're like an awkward teenager, worried that everyone is laughing at you behind your back, or worse. Where is this insecurity coming from? If someone has challenged your ideas, don't take it to heart. That's a normal part of life, and besides, brainstorming a new approach could strengthen the whole project. Whatever happens, forget about your worries. Just be your wonderful self. That's plenty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
