    "horoscope": "You just want to enjoy one warm, affectionate moment after another today with people you love and trust. You're normally a physical person, handing out hugs to anyone who needs them, but you're even more so today, partly because you need the closeness yourself. So don't spend time alone unless you have to. Seek out groups of friends, because you're in the mood to mingle and enjoy others' company.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
