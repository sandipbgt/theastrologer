Either way, the sense of discovery that fills you is exciting in the extreme. Don't pressure yourself to draw any firm conclusions just yet. Right now should be all about learning, testing and seeking. Trying to act decisively is just a losing battle!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
