    "horoscope": "You may reconnect in some way with your past today. Old photos or letters bring up sweet, long-forgotten emotions. A phone call from a dear friend or relative makes you smile, even if it brings a tear to your eye. Life is bittersweet, and today more so than ever. But it feels good to saturate yourself in emotional memories. It makes you feel more closely, genuinely connected to your own heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
