A box of photos or an old journal invites you to journey into the past. There you're sure to discover something interesting about yourself, your family or your current subject. It's a great time for a genealogy project, a visit to your therapist or researching a subject that holds particular interest for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
