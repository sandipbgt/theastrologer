    "horoscope": "You're more softhearted now than ever. Set strong personal boundaries today, because it's easy to over-empathize with people and animals in need. It's wonderful to have compassion for people in difficult circumstances. But your empathy runs so deep that you could take on someone else's feelings as your own. Be sure to distinguish your emotions from theirs -- and recognize that it's not your responsibility to save the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
