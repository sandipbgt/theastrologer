    "horoscope": "Today you feel emboldened to do and say things you normally might not. You're no shrinking violet! And when you feel passionate about something, you want to express yourself. Well, that should be no problem today. Of course, other people are also expressing their own fervent feelings -- both the positive ones and the heated ones. Don't be surprised if you end up having words with someone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
