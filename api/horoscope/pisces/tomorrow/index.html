    "horoscope": "Your selfless streak broadens today -- the part of you that wants to save the world one soul at a time. That may be a wonderful thing, if it inspires you to do some sort of charitable work. Just make an honest effort to avoid taking the weight of the world on your shoulders. The hard truth is, sometimes, people or projects are beyond saving. That's why it's important to choose your cause carefully.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
