    "horoscope": "Today, you're feeling quick and intuitive, and easily in control. Maybe that's because you know how to deal with the past -- you've already been there and done that. Don't forget that the future might be just a wee bit more challenging. Still, it's nice to get a breather every now and then, and that's what today will be. Enjoy it -- just don't get too comfortable. Tomorrow could bring  new challenges that will demand both effort and ingenuity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
