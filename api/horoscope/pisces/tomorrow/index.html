You'd rather not commit right now, but you probably won't be able to afford that luxury for much longer. Decisions will gnaw at you with increasing hunger today. That might tickle at first, but how long can you stand it? Snap out of your little moment of not doing. Don't waste any more of your time or resources chasing dreams. Dreams are fine things, but right now you have to focus on this issue and finish it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
