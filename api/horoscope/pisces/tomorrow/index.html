It's possible to be both, especially today, when your feet are planted more firmly on the ground than usual. This is a good time to get together with loved ones, help out a friend in need, or work on a project or angle that's important to your career. You can make some solid steps toward your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
