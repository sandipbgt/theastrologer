    "horoscope": "Most people are in high spirits today, but for some that means quick tempers and overreactions. You could get caught in the crossfire because of your compassionate nature. If you see a tense standoff developing between friends or coworkers, for example, you'll jump right in the middle to try to calm them down. But then you'll find yourself caught up in the drama! Dealing with the current energy may depend on choosing your battles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
