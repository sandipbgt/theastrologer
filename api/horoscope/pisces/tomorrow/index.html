    "horoscope": "Your selfless generosity is highlighted today. You want to give and give and give -- whatever you have, you're willing to donate to others, if it will help them somehow! This is a wonderful impulse, but it may be a misguided one. It's important to stay realistic when you're bending over backward for someone. For example, you can offer your assistance, but that doesn't mean someone's going to accept it graciously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
