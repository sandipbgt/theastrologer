    "horoscope": "You're feeling scattered and indecisive -- so much so that you can hardly decide how to deal with this uncomfortable feeling. Call a good friend to talk out your thoughts, or dump them into a trusty journal. You'll feel better. Sometimes you just need to clear the cobwebs from your mind -- your worries, frustrations and even hopes for the future. In the end, it's all just chatter, and it needs to be silenced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
