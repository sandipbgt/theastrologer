And why would you want to sabotage your own efforts? Remedy this sticky situation by letting your needs and opinions be known. You can hash things out with a minimum of hurt feelings, as long as you're open with others. If you bottle it all up inside, you're the one who will be hurt.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
