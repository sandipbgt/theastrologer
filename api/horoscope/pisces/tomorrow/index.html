Thus, you know what someone else is saying today is true, but only from one, rather limited point of view -- there are so many others, after all. But before you set this person straight, do some research to make sure you know what you're talking about. It would be embarrassing if you were wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
