    "horoscope": "You're feeling extra sweet and sentimental today. A hug from a loved one is restorative to your soul. A sappy commercial might even bring tears to your eyes! If so, they're sweet tears, because you're filled with compassion. It's a great day to gather friends or family for a home-cooked meal, or to take a long bath and get to bed early. Pamper yourself as well as the people you adore.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
