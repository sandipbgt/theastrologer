While it's not fair to expect perfection, it's a good idea to do your best. That includes accepting feedback from others who can help you improve your work. Be as thick-skinned as possible so constructive advice doesn't feel like criticism.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
