    "horoscope": "Boldness is important now, and the universe favors those who tap into their confidence even if they're feeling vulnerable. That's the true meaning of courage, after all. It doesn't mean you aren't hesitant or nervous; it means you have those feelings and you choose to proceed anyway. The current energy is perfect for developing that side of yourself that's willing to push forward even when you're uncertain of the outcome.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
