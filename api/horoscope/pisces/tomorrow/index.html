    "horoscope": "You feel deeply serene today, connected with the world around you at a level that's hard to explain. Your compassion and intuition are heightened now, and that's saying a lot. It's even easier than usual to sense what your friends and loved ones are feeling and thinking. You're capable of great healing now. All you have to do is lend an ear or a hand to someone in need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
