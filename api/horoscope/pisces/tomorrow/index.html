You'd like to think you have only the best intentions, but in reality you might just be going with your animal programming. Expect to feel the pull of desire's abrupt demands today. It's OK if this makes you uneasy. That shows you're paying attention and that you know your individuality from your id. Or, if you don't want to get all Freudian about it, try separating who you are from what your body wants in the moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
