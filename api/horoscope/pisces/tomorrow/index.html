Your job today will be getting others to notice you. Maybe then they'll listen to what you're trying to get across. Of course, once you have their attention, that would be a good time to dialog about what they want, too. Some of their suggestions could be even better than yours. Hey, what do you care as long as it's interesting?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
