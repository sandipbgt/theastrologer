    "horoscope": "Being loud and grabbing the reins has never really been your style, but today it's the only thing that works. Still, it feels downright perverse, and you worry that people might find you pretentious. Would it help to keep reminding yourself that you're just trying to help? Try not to boss around your sweetheart, or your coworkers. There's a difference between taking the lead and being overbearing. Yes, people might need direction now, but use your dead-on instincts to figure out a way to improve things in a subtler, gentler way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
