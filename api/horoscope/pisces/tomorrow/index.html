    "horoscope": "Yesterday's stable, centered energy is gone, replaced by something of a much higher frequency. The phone is ringing off the hook, emails are flooding your Inbox, and by the end of the day, your head may be pounding. It's hard for your sensitive system to take all this back-and-forth! Keep the pressure to a minimum by taking frequent breaks. Do some deep breathing or even a quick meditation to stay calm and focused.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
