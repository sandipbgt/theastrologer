    "horoscope": "Your innate gifts -- creativity, sensitivity, compassion and intuition -- are heightened today. You feel deeply connected to your friends and family, so it's easy to focus on nurturing yourself and your loved ones. Spend time at home. Cook a big meal. Offer sympathy to someone who could use your support. Your self-protective instincts are strong now, so it's easy to set good boundaries even as you reach out to someone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
