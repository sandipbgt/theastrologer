    "horoscope": "You'll find that you're even more distracted than usual today, with thoughts and feelings flying in and out of your consciousness. This can be maddening, if you let it. The key is to avoid struggling. It will be very difficult to control your mental wanderings today, so just let them go where they please. This can actually be quite a creative zone for you, so jot your ideas down in a notebook.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
