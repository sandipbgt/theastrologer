Any tension in themakes you feel inwardly strained. But you aren't in the mood for disharmony on any level, so talking things out may have to wait for another day. Just don't wear yourself out worrying about everyone around you,. They can take care of themselves.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
