    "horoscope": "Your head is level and your judgments cool. You can bring much-needed practicality to any situation at work or at home. For today, you've got both feet on the ground, and your imagination is as vivid as ever. This is a great combination, because it allows you to perceive, act and communicate with your whole being. Whatever you start today, your friends will stand by you, and you can count on their support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
