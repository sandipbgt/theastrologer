    "horoscope": "Mystery's always appealed to you at a physical level -- one you can certainly feel but can't explain. Today, secrets are even more deliciously compelling than usual, because they carry you into imagination. There, you can play the 'what-if' game, and use talents that other people rarely get a chance to see. What gorgeous visions will you bring back? You might dream up something that sparks a new endeavor, something really important and workable in the real world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
