    "horoscope": "You may experience more mental stimulation today than you can handle. All these thoughts zipping around in your mind, all this energy surging around you, can be a little much for someone who exists in a sea of emotions. But get creative and put this energy to use, rather than letting it spin your head. You've got so much going on under the surface, so get it out in your medium of choice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
