    "horoscope": "If your physical energy is a little low today, stay home, or at least get some extra sleep. But you may be feeling fine, because you're in your element, feeling your emotions even more deeply than usual. Love and romance are so sweet, they bring tears to your eyes. Your heart softens, even toward those who have hurt you. You feel others' pain as your own, which deepens your sense of empathy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
