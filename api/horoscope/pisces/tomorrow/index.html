    "horoscope": "Your sweet nature is apparent to everyone who looks. Friends and strangers alike notice how your voice and gaze are steady, without a hint of doubt in sight. You love the world deeply, and that fills you with a tender, steady passion. You make other people think of all the things that make them want to get up in the morning and greet the new day. That's the kind of example you're setting now, just by being yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
