    "horoscope": "You aren't driven by materialistic urges. Still, today is a good day to keep your future in mind, and especially your financial stability. You're more grounded than usual, which helps in making solid decisions about money and other resources. You have a good sense of which risks are smart and which aren't. Plus, you're willing to work hard now to make gains in the future. That's what maturity and responsibility are all about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
