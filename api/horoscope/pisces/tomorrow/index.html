In general, though, you're in good spirits, and a sense of optimism permeates the day. Do something to ground yourself, such as focusing on a mundane chore at home, or doing some stretches on your living room floor. That way, your mind can wander from a safe, secure anchor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
