    "horoscope": "You're filled today with childlike wonder and appreciation for the world around you. There's an excitement in the, and you'd like nothing better than to tap into it. But at the very same time, you may also feel a little wistful. You're emotional and impressionable by nature, and you've felt a little scattered for the past day or so. Focus on your many blessings, such as being surrounded by dear friends and family.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
