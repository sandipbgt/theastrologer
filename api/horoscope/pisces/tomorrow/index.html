But don't take it too far. Pay attention to your health by eating well, relaxing and doing soothing exercises like yoga and stretching. A gentle approach goes best with everyone from your best friend to your lover to your boss. Savor a little quiet time at home, and enjoy the chance to catch up on some good old-fashioned self care.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
