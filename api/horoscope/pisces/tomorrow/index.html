    "horoscope": "You can feel the current of life shifting around you, and it's making you nervous. But isn't that what life is all about -- constant changes? And normally, you're extremely adaptable. But today, some deep-rooted, vague insecurity is making you cling to the status quo. Maybe it's time to have a gentle but firm talk with yourself. Don't try to escape these changes. They're really for the best. Think of this as a unique chance to sail off in a refreshing new direction.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
