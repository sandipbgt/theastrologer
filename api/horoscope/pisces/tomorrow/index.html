    "horoscope": "Your sweet visions of the future don't exactly match up with reality, do they? Today makes that pretty clear. Ah, well. You knew about your rose-colored glasses, especially in matters of the heart. But today, you're completely practical and see your life just as it really is., being realistic about your relationships will only help you make them better. Try not to project dreamy illusions onto anyone and listen to what people tell you -- they're probably being honest, if a bit overly critical. It'll be a real learning experience.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
