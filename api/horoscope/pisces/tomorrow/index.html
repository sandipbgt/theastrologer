    "horoscope": "Be sensible today with your money, your time and other resources. This isn't difficult to do now. You're naturally attuned to efficiency and practical matters. It's a good time to stabilize anything in your life that feels uncertain. For example, if you don't have a work schedule or a budget in place, spend some time today drawing one up. Establishing a routine is a good idea now, since you're more likely to stick to it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
