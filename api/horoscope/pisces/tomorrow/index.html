    "horoscope": "Set aside the usual goals, games and greed. Be calm and in the moment, because your system is crying out for a change of pace. Instead of living in fear that others will laugh or call you weak, let your natural kindness come out. Your heart is in charge today. Take its orders willingly. What if everyone did this? That might sound a little too idealistic, but any local or global improvement begins with a few motivated individuals. You could be the one to start it up this time. Just don't fall into that same pattern of goals, games and greed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
