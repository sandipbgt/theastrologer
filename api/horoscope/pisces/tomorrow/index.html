    "horoscope": "Today, the barrier between the tangible side of life and the intangible seems very thin. You may have a vivid dream, and wake up and wonder if it really happened. Or the love you feel for another person may seem like a physical thing -- even if you can't touch or even see them. It's easy to lose yourself in these perceptions, and it's enjoyable, too. Just don't lose your hold on reality for long!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
