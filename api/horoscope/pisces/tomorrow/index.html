    "horoscope": "Self-pity could be messy, and the cleanup could make this particular problem even worse. But today, you may not even see your mess through whatever illusion is helping you operate. Clearly, this is unwise and unsafe. Part those veils soon so that you can see where you're going. And if you know exactly what you're trying to accomplish and why, being false or sneaky about it won't do you any favors. So take a deep breath, love yourself, own your situation and get on with the life you're supposed to be living.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
