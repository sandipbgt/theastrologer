    "horoscope": "Your communication style is like an Impressionist painting. You use your imagination to describe subjective feelings or abstract images. And you hope your meaning comes across. But today, try to communicate more meticulously. Especially if you're dealing with a business or financial matter, do your best to speak in plain, precise language. Clarify ideas for yourself and for the person listening. Make sure everyone's on the same page before you proceed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
