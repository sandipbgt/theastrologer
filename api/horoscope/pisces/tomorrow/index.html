If you've been missing one-on-one time with your sweetheart, ask them out on a date, or cook a romantic dinner at home. If you've been skimping on alone time, take a long walk, go see a funny movie, or take a nap. Any of these should help you feel more happily centered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
