    "horoscope": "Low energy could catch up with you today. Maybe it's all the recent fun, and the stress, too. Take today to rest and recuperate as much as your schedule allows. Be realistic about your feelings, your relationships and your general life situation, but avoid pessimistic thinking. If you slip into gloomy thoughts, distract yourself with practical tasks around the house, such as cleaning or balancing your checkbook.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
