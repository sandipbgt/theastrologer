    "horoscope": "You want perfect harmony in your relationships today. But life isn't perfect, and human interactions definitely aren't. So, to fill in the gaps left by reality, you might back down from an issue when you shouldn't, in order to maintain the peace. Conflict isn't pleasant, but sometimes it's necessary. Find a way to represent your true feelings today, Pisces. Odds are strong that you can do that without causing an argument!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
