And it's perfect for, say, brainstorming a creative project. But don't become too attached to any one brain wave just yet. Things are still developing. Even a firm philosophy could shift dramatically in the next day or two. So stay open to brilliant ideas, but avoid committing, for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
