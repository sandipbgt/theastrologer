You're encountering a lot of fresh, interesting ideas, and you're weighing things out, trying to decide what you do and don't believe in. Logic plays an important role in this, as does talking with other people to get their perspective. Consider this a group project of self-enlightenment. You could experience a little soul-growth today, just by opening your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
