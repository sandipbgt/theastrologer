    "horoscope": "You said you were sorry, and you actually meant it. Now you're doing a lot better, just as you promised. Nobody could blame you for slacking, but don't take it personally if anyone does. They're just not paying attention. Whatever your task is, savor it for a while. Feel the quiet ecstasy of everything finally falling into place. After you celebrate that total connection by cheerfully doing what you're supposed to be doing today, then you can have the party. And everybody is welcome, whether or not they believed in you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
