    "horoscope": "Today's friendly-but-detached vibe makes you a bit uncomfortable. You like the friendliness, of course. Everyone seems to be talkative and in the mood for company. But you're quite sensitive to emotional nuances, and you're able to pick up on a certain reservation in the people around you, with whom you'd like to be close. Don't place too much importance on it. In a day or two, everyone will soften up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
