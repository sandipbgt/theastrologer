    "horoscope": "Let yourself dream today. Sleeping in or taking a nap is a good idea, since your energy is likely to be lower than usual. And your dreams are vivid. Write them down when you wake up! Daydreaming is extra enjoyable now, too. Your mind wanders like a leaf on the breeze, touching on different subjects. You might think mostly in abstract images today. Your thoughts don't need to make logical sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
