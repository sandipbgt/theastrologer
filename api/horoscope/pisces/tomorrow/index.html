This might be anything from closing off a hole under your fence to lifting weights or starting a savings account. You can also strengthen your personal relationships by reaching out to loved ones. If you talk out an issue, speak as clearly and compassionately as possible. It might be hard to put your feelings into words, unless you speak from the heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
