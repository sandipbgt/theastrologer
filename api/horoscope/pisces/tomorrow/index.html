    "horoscope": "Flare-ups can develop quickly today because everyone's emotions are stirred up. But while other people are busy acting and reacting, getting their feelings hurt and their buttons pushed, you're able to rise above all the hubbub. You take a highly compassionate view of your fellow humans. You may even have an opportunity to help someone through a rough patch, by giving them caring, unwavering support. This is your strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
