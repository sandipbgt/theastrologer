    "horoscope": "Your sentimental side is showing again. That in itself isn't a bad thing; it's wonderful that you feel others' pain so readily and perceive their needs so clearly. Except, right now, your perceptions aren't as clear as usual. You need to let your more logical, conscious awareness override your sentimentality today, as hard -- or harsh -- as that may seem. Focusing on the facts, first and foremost, will help you sort out the truth of the matter. Then you can proceed from there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
