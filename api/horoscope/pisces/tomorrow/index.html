    "horoscope": "Today offers a wonderful chance to gather friends and loved ones and have a great time together. You're feeling unusually grounded, which enables you to be the perfect host -- thorough and precise about meeting your guests' needs, which you'll intuit with your keenly perceptive nature. Can you use this newly honed skill elsewhere? Your clients or employer might like to know how well you can take care of others, on many different levels at once.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
