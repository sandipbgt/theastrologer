    "horoscope": "Family responsibilities may beckon today. If so, find concrete ways to support the people you love. This might mean a hug for a troubled friend, assisting an elderly relative with running errands, or anything else with tangible or measurable results. Your own energy runs deep and smooth right now, which is a good thing. It enables you to serve as a strong shoulder or backbone for someone else who isn't feeling so centered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
