    "horoscope": "Try not to be thin-skinned today. The current energy leaves no room for sensitivity. People are in bold, even aggressive moods, so they probably aren't looking out for your feelings. Someone might press a vulnerable spot without realizing what they're doing, simply because they're so focused on pursuing their own goals. You might benefit from such single-mindedness, yourself. At least it would make you more resistant to others' thoughtless comments!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
