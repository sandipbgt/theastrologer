    "horoscope": "You're a from-the-heart kind of person. But today, be ruthless in applying common sense to everything you do -- even if it goes against that soft heart of yours. Sometimes, rational wisdom counts more than intuitive insight, and this is one of those times. So make an effort to be organized. Instead of feeling your way through a situation, judge it carefully and act accordingly. You can do this, gentle Pisces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
