    "horoscope": "Today, you're beautifully aware of your past -- the people and experiences that have gone before you, contributing to the essence of the person you are now. You may feel deep gratitude toward your forebears, or a deep sense of compassion and forgiveness, if your childhood experiences were less than ideal. It's a wonderful day to work on healing old wounds and building bridges with anyone from whom you've felt estranged.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
