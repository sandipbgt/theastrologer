    "horoscope": "You feel the strain of surface tension, and maybe the deep creaking of something much bigger about to pop. The real is pushing at the artificial. The future is pulling away from the past. Be honest with yourself if you caused any of this, because that's always the first step toward fixing it. Today will be interesting if you're OK with suspense. But if massive uncertainty isn't working out for you, let someone else take over. There's nothing wrong with avoiding trouble you don't think you can handle. Some call it cowardice, but others call it sanity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
