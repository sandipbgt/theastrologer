    "horoscope": "Optimism is such a wonderful feeling. It's what keeps you afloat on a dark day. Today is far from dark, of course. Most people, including you, are feeling energetic and vivacious. Just try to keep a handle on your optimism. Don't aim for pessimism, of course! Just be realistic, especially if you're spending money or making important plans for the future. It's a little too easy now to go overboard.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
