    "horoscope": "You possess an especially flexible, open mind today. Generally speaking, that's an advantage in most situations. You have an accepting attitude that puts other people at ease. And your sense of discovery enables you to learn something fascinating and unexpected. But do set some boundaries, when appropriate. There is such a thing as being too flexible, especially in social situations. Don't let anyone take advantage of your willingness to accommodate them!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
