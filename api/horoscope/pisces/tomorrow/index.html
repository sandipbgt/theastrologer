    "horoscope": "Today could bring complex issues to light. If you were any less of a feeling person, this might make for a tricky, confusing day. But you're able to suspend logic and proceed on instinct alone. Right now, that is a real gift. It enables you to read between the lines of what other people are saying, so you can understand the feelings behind the words. It enables you to be compassionate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
