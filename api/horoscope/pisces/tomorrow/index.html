You could accomplish something great now, or at least make solid moves in the right direction. Have some fun, too. Connecting with friends feels good, because you're all there, present in mind, heart and body. Enjoy this sense of grounded awareness and self-possession.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
