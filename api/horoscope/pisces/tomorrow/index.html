    "horoscope": "Overconfidence masks insecurity. You've seen this in others, and now it's your turn to dismount from that high horse. Oh, stop worrying about your dignity, already. You'll have a much easier landing if you go quietly. Today it'll be OK to admit that maybe you don't actually have all the answers. Honesty plays well around here, so think before you speak, and speak only the truth. You've seen this in others, too, and you respect it, don't you? So it's time to reenter the real world and earn some of that respect back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
