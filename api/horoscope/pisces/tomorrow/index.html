    "horoscope": "If someone accuses you of arrogance today, don't take it too personally. Instead, consider the charge objectively. What are you doing that looks to others like egotism? Self-importance usually isn't your style; in fact, you err far more often on the side of selflessness. For that reason, it's time to take a careful look at yourself to see where this might be coming from. If you realize you've been a little overbearing in some area of your life, you can make the proper amends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
