    "horoscope": "You might think you're keeping your true emotions hidden from the people around you, but -- news flash -- you're more transparent than you think! In fact, your actions make those 'secret' feelings clear to everyone. You'd make a bad liar today, so don't even try to be anything other than perfectly honest. Don't waste time on pretense; instead, be as vulnerable and softhearted on the outside as you are inside. And when people share their true feelings with you, don't assume you know their inner motivations. This spirit of sharing will cut through any insecurity you may feel.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
