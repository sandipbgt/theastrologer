    "horoscope": "That hazy, uneasy feeling you've had now becomes certainty -- It's time to do something. Uh-oh! You're incredibly gentle and compassionate by nature, but when there's a cause that needs your support, you're as fierce as any lion. Life gets interesting when you stop thinking and just act, doesn't it? Today, you'll be busy defending something or someone you feel passionate about. Good luck, and do your best to keep your own supportive resources intact -- meaning, don't make enemies if you don't have to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
