    "horoscope": "Let your mind wander today, and pay attention to the places that it visits. Your imagination is an important tool in mapping out the next several weeks of your life. And today brings you the perfect opportunity to make some plans. This is the start of a new personal cycle for you, so seek a deep level of concentration. In that inwardly focused state, you'll uncover your own dreams. Then, you can pursue them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
