When you get right down to it, those are pretty vague concepts. So make them specific. Find a way to bring about the transformation you dream of. One good place to start? Within yourself. Practice the openness and tolerance you'd like to see others embrace.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
