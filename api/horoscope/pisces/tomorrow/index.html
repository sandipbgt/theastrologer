    "horoscope": "Decision-making is tough today. You want everyone to get along, and you're intuitive enough to pick up on the feelings and needs of almost everyone around you. That wonderful quality can become a problem on days like this, when you can't move forward on a certain matter. The only fix is to stop worrying about everyone else and focus on you, but that runs against your nature. Try to make a decision, Pisces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
