    "horoscope": "Be factually honest even when the facts could use a little fluffing. Be emotionally forthright even if you have to get past the squirm factor. Say what must finally be said, and you'll feel lighter, cleaner and a lot more deserving. Broadcast and spread your message for the people who need to hear it. Be as subtle or blatant as you have to be, but put the whole truth out there today. The benefits outweigh the risks - it won't even feel like gambling, because you have nothing to lose.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
