    "horoscope": "Many people are apt to get very intense today in their feelings, behavior and self-expression. But you don't mind all the emotional upheaval. You have a great deal of compassion for anyone who is feeling upset. You can see past anger to the hurt or loneliness that lies behind it. This is a true gift,. It enables you to reach out to someone instead of lashing out at them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
