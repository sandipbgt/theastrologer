    "horoscope": "Today, you're more emotional than ever. Your compassionate side kicks in. You might even find yourself getting teary-eyed at the slightest provocation! The good thing is, you actually enjoy moody, subjective days like this. Your emotions are your strength and your identity. Deep feelings make you feel connected with the world around you. They remind you that life is all about the sentimental bonds you share with others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
