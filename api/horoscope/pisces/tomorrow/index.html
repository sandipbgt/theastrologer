If you're at work, rest assured that your boss or client will notice your solid output. It's hard not to appreciate someone as orderly and dependable as you! Plus, you're creative enough to be resourceful -- another added bonus for anyone working with you or depending on you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
