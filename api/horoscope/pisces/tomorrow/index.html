    "horoscope": "You're unusually grounded today. It's easier than usual to focus, even on mundane tasks you would normally find quite tedious. Work goes especially well now. You actually take pleasure in business matters -- what a pleasant surprise! It just feels good to take care of business. It's also a good time to attend to your finances. Establish a routine or schedule if one is needed, or set up a reasonable budget.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
