    "horoscope": "You're a sponge for new experiences. There's no hesitation or apprehension. Anything romantic, anything that speaks to your passions -- that's what you're in the mood for. You could throw yourself into a relationship now, with no worry for what might happen in the future. Or you might lose yourself in a creative project, letting it consume your time and energy until it's complete. If you're passionate about your work, that also calls you. It could be a heady day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
