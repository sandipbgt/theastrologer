If your spouse is tense, you'll soon start feeling knots in your own shoulders! It's days like this when it's most important to stay focused on your own tasks. Don't get caught up in trying to help everyone else with theirs. Put blinders on to stay sane!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
