    "horoscope": "Your immense compassion comes into play today. If you see people or animals in need, you'll want to pitch in and help make their lives better. It's wonderful to get involved with a charity or a cause, as long as you don't overextend yourself. You have a tendency to give and give and give -- until you have nothing left for yourself! Do your best to strike that balance between self and other.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
