You have your reasons, of course, but not everyone else will be clear about what they are. And even if they understand, do they really deserve to be treated like this? After all, these are your friends, family, or at least sympathetic coworkers or strangers. Be a little more considerate. You still have to live with them after this phase passes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
