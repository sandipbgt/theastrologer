    "horoscope": "Original ideas may occur to you today. Or maybe you'll simply be attracted to someone else's unique perspective on the world. Either way, your focus is on helping others. You want to get involved and help create positive change. That's a wonderful urge, and there are countless ways to channel your energies.
