    "horoscope": "A nervous feeling blooms within you today, seemingly out of nowhere. Free-floating anxiety can be worse than well-founded worries. It's hard when you're all stirred up and you have no idea why! And you're unusually sensitive to emotional fluctuations like this. Stay calm with deep breathing. Remind yourself that feelings soon pass. At least this is a fast-paced day. Before you know it, it'll be evening.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
