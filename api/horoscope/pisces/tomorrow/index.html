If family or coworkers are struggling around you, you'll lend an easygoing hand. If there's a team project to tackle, you'll jump in with a clear vision of your goal. But, kicking back with a good book and a soft pillow is okay, too. Whatever you please.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
