    "horoscope": "You feel calm, centered and relaxed today. This helps you connect with friends and strangers alike in a charming, natural way.

Imagine your feet taking root in the ground like trees. Stretch your thoughts and feelings up to the heavens.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
