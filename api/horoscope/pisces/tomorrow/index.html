    "horoscope": "Everyone's filled with energy, including you -- maybe a little too much of it. The chaos they're creating is getting a little confusing, and the sloppiness is becoming overwhelming. On the other hand, military precision is inspiring, but you're not really a detail person. Well, you certainly have your work cut out for you today. It could take a while to get anywhere, so don't try to launch any grand new schemes. Instead, focus on what's already on your plate, and look for appropriate resolution.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
