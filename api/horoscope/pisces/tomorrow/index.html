    "horoscope": "You think that militant stance is impressing people, but it's getting you nowhere. Plus, you're a little too defensive today, which doesn't help either. What you need is an ally. Someone who can help you focus on the real issue, whatever that might be, and brainstorm some ways to improve things. But the way you're coming across might make that difficult, if not impossible. Try not to call too much attention to your unfinished project. Just keep working on things yourself, and wait for clarity and good humor to return.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
