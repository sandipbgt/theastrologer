    "horoscope": "Today, inner serenity and outer composure are yours. Your energy is focused, your emotions calm. You can tackle anything on your agenda through hard, steady effort, which comes easily now. You can look at a problem or situation and see the bottom line. This is a good technique in all areas of life: Take a practical approach to problem solving, and rely on rules and systems already in place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
