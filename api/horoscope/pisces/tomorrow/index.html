    "horoscope": "It's a great day to spend time with children. You're in the mood to play, and your inner child is easily accessible. Telling jokes or silly stories satisfies your funny bone.

The current influence could have you placing pressure on yourself to perform, but humor keeps things light.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
