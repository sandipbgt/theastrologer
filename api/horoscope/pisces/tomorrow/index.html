    "horoscope": "You're open to new, experimental or unfounded ideas today -- not that you're generally closed to them. You're one of those rare people who understand there's much more to life than meets the eye. And today is a great day to explore those fascinating realms. You're in a scientific frame of mind, so computer programs and astrology make more sense than usual. You stand to learn a lot now, just by keeping your mind open.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
