Your words will be liquid today, and your actions will be fluid. Your position will be bendable, too. Either you do a lot of yoga, or you've got relaxation down to a science. Some people may call you spineless for all this, but that's only because they're so rigid. All you're doing is changing with the changes, and that's OK for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
