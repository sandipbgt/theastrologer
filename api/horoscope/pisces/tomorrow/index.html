    "horoscope": "Staying focused can be a challenge for you, but today, at least try. Of course, you're in the mood for a certain something, or maybe a certain someone. As usual, your mind is in the clouds as you dream of getting what you want. Still, stay attuned to the task at hand, whatever that might be. Remember, you're trying to avoid certain outcomes, not trigger them prematurely. Pay attention to your health, too. Today is for tending to details -- you can relax and dream later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
