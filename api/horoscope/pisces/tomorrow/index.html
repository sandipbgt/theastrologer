    "horoscope": "Suddenly, it's as if the world has turned into chaos. At work,and responsibilities become overwhelming, and you just want to hide. At home, things may not be much better. If you're romantically involved, expect today to be confusing at best. You're feeling pessimistic and disorganized, which only makes things worse. Still, it's just your way of rebelling. This mood will pass,-- it always does. But try not to bury your head in the sand. Leaving your projects and relationships unattended could cause problems later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
