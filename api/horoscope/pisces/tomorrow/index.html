    "horoscope": "Well, you're certainly cutting a swathe through this landscape. You're quite the flamboyant character, full of provocative comments and slippery answers. It's like you're one of those lucky troublemakers, always stirring things up and then jumping to safety as it all swirls down the drain. There's an element of danger here, as you probably know. So here's a little reality check before you go and do it again. Where do you see yourself tomorrow? Next week? Next month? Don't buy a ticket for the wrong direction. There's still time to correct your course.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
