    "horoscope": "Your humanitarian side -- the part of you that's filled with concern and compassion for the people and other beings around you -- kicks in today. You have good ideas for what you can do to help, plus the energy it takes to put those plans into effect. The current influence is a bit unemotional in nature, which is actually a good thing. You can get something accomplished without your feelings getting in the way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
