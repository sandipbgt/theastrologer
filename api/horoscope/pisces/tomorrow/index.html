Back up to get some distance, but don't distance yourself so much that you won't care any more. It's easy to tell the good from the bad, but expect some trouble separating better from best. Sort it all out today, or things could drag on longer than you want. Save yourself some work down the road when you'd probably rather be playing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
