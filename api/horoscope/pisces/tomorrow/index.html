    "horoscope": "Your physical energy may be subdued today. But mentally and emotionally, you're deeply in tune. You can read your friends and family like a book. You can interpret dreams like a professional analyst. You can nurture yourself and others as if you were born to make people feel loved and supported. And, in fact, you were. Tap into that gift today, gentle. It makes the world a better place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
