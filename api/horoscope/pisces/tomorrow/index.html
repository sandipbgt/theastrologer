    "horoscope": "Today, your selfless nature is highlighted. If you see someone in need, you'll jump to the rescue with no thought for what it might cost you. And you certainly don't need recognition for your assistance. This is a wonderful impulse, but try not to take it too far. It's good to set some boundaries about how far you're willing to go for another person, and where you need to draw the line.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
