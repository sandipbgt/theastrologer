It's about learning and growing, and hey, there might even be fun or free food. You'll never know what might happen if you don't take a chance. Plus, you could hurt people's feelings by blowing them off, and you'd hate it if they did that to you. So be patient and stay here for the time being. Anything elsewhere that can't wait another day isn't worth doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
