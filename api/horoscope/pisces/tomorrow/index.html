    "horoscope": "A sentimental mood washes over you. You feel deeply connected to every being around you, be they human, feline, canine or some other member of nature's kingdom. Reach out to the people and pets in your immediate sphere of influence -- your family and close friends -- and turn your nurturing energy toward them. One of them could probably use a good dose of your strength, kindness and caring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
