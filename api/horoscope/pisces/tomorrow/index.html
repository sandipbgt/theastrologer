Permission may or may not be forthcoming, but do you care? If not, you should. Sneaky borrowing might get you into trouble, because not everyone will believe that you're planning to return whatever you take. Don't pretend that right and wrong won't apply to you. No one's head is that big. Everyone needs to be honest now if your community is going to work the way it's supposed to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
