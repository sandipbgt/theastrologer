After all, when everything is brilliant, nothing really stands out. Well, at least you'll have fun as you devise fantastic schemes with that wild imagination of yours. You're more interested in dreaming now than in acting on those dreams, and that's as it should be. Go as far as you want in your mental wanderings, but in reality, stick close to the tried and true.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
