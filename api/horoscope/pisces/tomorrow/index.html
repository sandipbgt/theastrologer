    "horoscope": "You want to achieve success, but something keeps holding you back -- and you're starting to get an inkling that it might be you. If you need to withdraw and make some internal changes, go ahead, and take your time. The outside world will find out about your personal renovation project soon enough. When you rejoin the fray, you can enjoy all the pats on the back you receive -- which will be many. You're well loved, you know. Remember that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
