In fact, things are starting to look pretty interesting, especially if you're working on something that will bring in money for your family or company. Your energy is humming and you've put a lot of energy into this -- but don't expect big results just yet. Just keep working your magic. It'll all pay off soon, and then you'll be glad you kept your cool.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
