    "horoscope": "This could be an unsettled day. Maybe you're the one who's feeling restless. On the other hand, maybe you're happy inside your own personal bubble and the disturbance is coming from the outside. So should you roll with these changes or resist them? Strong reactions could shake things up for neighbors or bystanders, and then you'd have a whole other set of problems on your hands. Take it one step at a time. Navigate by familiar landmarks on common ground. As long as you know where you are, things can't get too weird.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
