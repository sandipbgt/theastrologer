    "horoscope": "An idle mood sets in today. Instead of attending to your duties at work or at home, you're in the mood to have fun, chase adventure and generally goof off. This is fine, if you can shift things around in your schedule. But if you have to stick to your task list, summon your focus and energy. Perhaps you'll get absorbed in your duties if you view it as a matter of principle.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
