    "horoscope": "Enjoy this soft, warm, fuzzy day, but focus at least a bit on the future. Think about what you want to do in the next few weeks. Don't be shy or overly general. The more specific you can be about what you want, the more likely you are to recognize it when it comes. Otherwise, gifts could arrive in forms you don't expect! Make this cycle your own, and plant a seed that's truly special.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
