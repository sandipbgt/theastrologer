    "horoscope": "Your feeling nature is both deepened and heightened today. You can sense others' emotions in a way that may almost seem psychic. Really, it's just that extra degree of sensitivity you've always possessed. You can read nonverbal cues without even realizing you're tuning in at that level. This enables you to respond to people's feelings from a place of genuine care and compassion, which someone may sorely need right now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
