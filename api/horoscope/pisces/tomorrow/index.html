    "horoscope": "Free your mind today. Strange ideas may present themselves at random. It's a good thing you aren't one to judge! You're very good at following your intuition, even if it doesn't make much sense in the moment. Do that today. The worst that might happen is your idea ends up falling flat. But you might stumble into something truly innovative and brilliant.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
