    "horoscope": "You feel connected with each and every other being on the planet. This realization is like a warm glow in your soul, softening your heart and clearing your vision. Someone in your life is sure to find this highly appealing and today you'll get as lucky as you want to be. Lose yourself in the beauty of your surroundings and the joy of loving others. Any or all of it will feel like a blessing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
