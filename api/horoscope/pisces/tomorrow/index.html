Focusing on your work may be a losing battle today, unless your work is based on imaginative flights of fancy.

But if you have a tedious project on your agenda, you might make a valiant effort to tackle it, only to find your thoughts drifting repeatedly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
