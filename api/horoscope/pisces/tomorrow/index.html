    "horoscope": "Gain mastery over your dreams and visions. You're in a state of lucid dreaming: Whatever you envision becomes reality, if you believe in it wholeheartedly enough. If you invite beauty and creativity into your life, they'll come. But it isn't magic that creates this phenomenon, it's pure and simple science. Put your thoughts toward positive projects and intentions, and you'll be that much closer to making those things materialize.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
