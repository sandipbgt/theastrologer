    "horoscope": "That hum of excitement running through your veins? That's the current cosmic influence at work. Its energy boost puts you in the mood to get out and about. The further away from familiar people and surroundings, the better! Just don't forget you're a loving, connected sort of person. If you strike out on your own, you could end up feeling strangely isolated. Grab a friend to accompany you on your adventures.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
