    "horoscope": "An influx of bright, warm energy puts you in the mood for activity and company. You want to impress others, so you're dressing the part and approaching people with a big smile. This is wonderful. Just don't lose sight of your objective. Keep a firm idea in mind of why you're trying to project such a positive, energetic image. You aren't just going for others' approval. You have solid goals and a real agenda.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
