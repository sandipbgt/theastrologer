    "horoscope": "Your sociable mood could make for a tough day if you have to focus at work or attend to other sober matters. Plus, you're in people-pleaser mode, so you aren't direct about speaking your mind. In certain situations, it's fine to hang back and let others take the lead. But if you're in a situation that calls for you to step up and take it yourself, you could feel quite uncomfortable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
