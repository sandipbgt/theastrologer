Gather with the group, if you feel like exploring interesting ideas. But be aware that you're even more sensitive than usual to conflict. You might mistake a spirited debate for actual anger. For the sake of your own mood, don't let sharp words bother you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
