    "horoscope": "You're highly creative today, and you have the personal presence needed to manifest your ideas in reality. In fact, it might surprise you how easily you can make your visions come true. If only every day were like this! Being emotionally centered certainly helps. So does your heightened sensitivity to beauty. You see something gorgeous in nature, and it looks like art. An act of kindness similarly moves your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
