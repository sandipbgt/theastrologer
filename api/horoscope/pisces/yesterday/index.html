    "horoscope": "You're confused about your own needs today, but you may be insensitive to other people's feelings and agendas, too. What's more, this isn't like you. Normally you're so tuned in and compassionate toward others' needs. Are you feeling insecure about something,? If so, talk it out with someone who can offer you understanding. That will help you reconnect with your own sensitive, compassionate side, and you'll feel centered in the world once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
