    "horoscope": "Your energy ramps up today, so much that you might feel scatterbrained and excitable, as if your heart is pounding in your chest. If so, just find a quiet moment in which to take a few deep breaths. With some effort, you can channel this high energy into your work or any other effort you're pursuing right now. It's a great day to accomplish something, but try not to wear yourself out in the process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
