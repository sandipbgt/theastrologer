    "horoscope": "Your friends and acquaintances would surely agree that you're an incredibly kind soul. You extend your generosity to others in all kinds of ways. Still, sometimes you might hurt someone's feelings or make them feel neglected, simply by accident. If you owe a friend an apology, do it today. Once you take care of that, you'll be at one with the world. Self-awareness elevates your soul. So does forgiving yourself for being human.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
