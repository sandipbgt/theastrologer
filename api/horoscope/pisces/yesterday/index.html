    "horoscope": "Your inner strength is formidable today, and it shines out like a beacon to everyone near you. Make no mistake -- this is a quiet, gentle strength. But that makes it even more intense than something aggressive or blustery. You're filled with a sense of calm certainty. Whatever is before you, you know you can do it. You trust that you'll handle any problems with love and conviction. This self-knowledge feels wonderful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
