Of course, you're one of the most affectionate, nurturing people around, but it never hurts to remind people that you care. Besides, these are the people who keep you stable. They deserve your thanks. Sharing good food with loved ones is a great way to center yourself today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
