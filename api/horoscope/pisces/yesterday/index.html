    "horoscope": "You know as well as anyone that little white lies can be a social lubricant. They help keep relationships running smoothly, and you support almost anything that makes other people feel more comfortable. But now, your efforts to not hurt someone's feelings might double back on you, making the situation worse. Oh, well. Mistakes are growth opportunities, and sometimes honesty really is the best policy, even if it causes an argument., if you get into it with someone today, focus on what you have in common instead of your differences.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
