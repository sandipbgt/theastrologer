    "horoscope": "Many people are in businesslike moods today. Don't be surprised if your coworkers or even your friends don't seem as warm as usual. And try not to take their aloofness personally! They're probably busy juggling various tasks and responsibilities, and simply don't have time to relate in a sociable way. The current energy lends itself to focused efforts, so you would do well to take advantage of this, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
