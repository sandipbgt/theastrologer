    "horoscope": "Today you're filled with a swelling optimism -- a deep sense of inner faith in the universe. It's wonderful to possess such a strong feeling of trust, and it's probably well founded. But the usual precautions still apply, especially if you visit a new place or spend time with someone you're just getting to know. The current energy could make you a bit gullible, which would leave you open to having your kindness exploited.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
