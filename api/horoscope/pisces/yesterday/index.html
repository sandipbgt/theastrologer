    "horoscope": "An imaginative boost from the cosmos has you feeling a little spaced out today. Or maybe you feel extra tuned in! Either way, you're capable of great creative output if you channel your visions. That's the hard part. Focusing isn't your strong point even on a good day. Now, your mind keeps wandering. Maybe it's best to let your thoughts roam. Later, you can put the images to good use.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
