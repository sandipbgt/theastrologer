    "horoscope": "The universe is an interesting, unpredictable place at the moment. You should welcome the chance for deep communications with your friends and loved ones. This goes for strangers and acquaintances, too, even though the outcome of these interactions will be hard to predict. For now, you don't care as much about the end result as you do about the process of connection. If you can, clear your schedule for the day. That way, you'll be ready for any person or encounter that comes knocking on your door.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
