    "horoscope": "Life seems a little dry today. It's hard to make a warm connection with others. Either they're too busy to reach out, or you are. Or, when you do reach out, they don't respond as warmly as you'd expected. Of course, your deepest, closest relationships are solid -- even if the other person seems emotionally remote. People are just taking care of business right now. This is a good chance for you to do the same.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
