    "horoscope": "Your emotional life takes on a deeply subjective hue today. It's easy to read the people around you if you just tune in to what your instincts are telling you. You want to help them, especially if you sense that they're feeling worried or upset. Be as nurturing as possible without taking on someone else's negativity. Sometimes you're like a sponge for others' feelings,-- good and bad!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
