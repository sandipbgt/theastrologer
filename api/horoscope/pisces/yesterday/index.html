    "horoscope": "Your close relationships take center stage today. A friend may need your brand of close, cuddly affection, or you may crave that warmth from them. But don't take it personally if someone isn't as emotionally available as you'd like them to be. A sense of loneliness is possible now, if you give in to pessimistic thoughts about your connection with someone. Seek out the company of positive friends to lift your spirits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
