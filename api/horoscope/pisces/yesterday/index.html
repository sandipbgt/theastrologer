    "horoscope": "Today, your past is as present in your mind as if it happened just yesterday. Old, sweet memories take up your dreams and your waking moments. It's a wonderful day to connect with your older relatives. If they're no longer around, bring them to life once again by going through photographs or letters. These trips down memory lane might be bittersweet, and yet, they fill your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
