    "horoscope": "Know whether you're actually helping others or only hurting yourself. Don't cross the fine line between making a peace offering and letting them take a piece of you. You've been through this enough to know that you'll be a lot more useful when you're whole and happy. So if you need some personal time, take it. During this day of rest or vacation, you can absorb all the power you'll soon use to chase away other people's problems. Even if you're not a military type, you ought to appreciate the idea of security through strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
