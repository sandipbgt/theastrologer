    "horoscope": "You're intuitive by nature, but today your insight into people's needs and feelings is even more piercing than usual. You might be able to tell when a loved one is feeling stressed out or upset, even if you're far away from them. This is one of your natural gifts, and you should use it today to connect with others in a loving way. You need the sustenance of that emotional bond, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
