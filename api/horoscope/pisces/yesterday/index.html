    "horoscope": "Someone could sweep you off your feet today. You're enthralled by their larger-than-life personality, their warmth and generosity. Just make sure you're seeing the situation as it is, and not as you hope it is -- because there may be a big difference. The world is full of salesmen. If you're thinking of jumping into a new relationship or making a big purchase, ask a trusted friend for their perspective before making any moves.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
