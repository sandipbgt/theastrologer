    "horoscope": "Anxiety is bad for you now. It'll just scatter your power through nervous  reactions. Tense situations are less stable. Sure, opposing forces may be holding things in balance, but how long can that last? Try to have more faith in yourself. Remember the vision that brought you here in the first place, and you'll see this is just another stop along the way, not your destination. In another day you'll be ready to move on, and this whole weird episode will be nothing but an uneasy memory, like a dream that you can choose to ignore.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
