It's more likely to be the deeply emotional energy at work right now, slowing you down. If you normally like to work out at a high intensity, it's a great time to go swimming instead. It's also a great time just to take it easy. Napping or daydreaming are especially nice because they let your mind wander.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
