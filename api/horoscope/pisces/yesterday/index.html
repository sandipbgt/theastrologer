    "horoscope": "If you're romantically involved with someone, your relationship could be quite intense today. Even your connection with a good friend can strengthen and deepen now. But don't be surprised if difficult feelings come up now, too. If this happens, stay calm and speak honestly, from your heart. Process your emotions, don't avoid them. This is the way to build up your bond instead of breaking it down.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
