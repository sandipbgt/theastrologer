    "horoscope": "If your energy is low today, don't push yourself to go, go, go. While you may have tasks on your agenda that you can't get out of, it's much better if you can allow your mind to wander, because your head is already in the clouds. Besides, there's a lot of creativity in daydreams. You might surprise yourself by coming up with a truly visionary idea with real-world applications.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
