    "horoscope": "Your feet are planted firmly on the ground, which is good, since your head is so often in the clouds. You're blending all your perceptions -- physical, mental and intuitive -- and the world is your oyster. What do you want to do with this charmed day? You could bring great depth to a new creative project, or make solid steps toward a long-held goal. You could simply reconnect with the people you love best. It's entirely up to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
