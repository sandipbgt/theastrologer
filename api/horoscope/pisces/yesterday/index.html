If you're locked into work or some other commitment, you may have to put off your urge for company and laughter. But if you do have a chance to spend quality time with friends and family, take it. A tender hug or a funny story is soothing for your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
