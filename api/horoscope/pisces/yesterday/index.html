    "horoscope": "Being a part of a crowd holds great appeal today. You want to work side by side with other people, toward the same ideal. If you can look up to a visionary leader, so much the better. The stronger your sense of belief in what you're doing, the more energy you can muster. Just be sure to rest up at the end of the day. Such energy could be overwhelming!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
