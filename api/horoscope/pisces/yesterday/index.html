That slow, gentle touch of yours can really work wonders, you know. A little payback is even possible if you play things right. Stay calm and be generous, and you'll get what you need. Don't be greedy, though -- leave some for others. They have their own problems to deal with, just like you do. In a few days, things will feel clearer once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
