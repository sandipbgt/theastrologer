    "horoscope": "Well, you're quite the model citizen all of a sudden. Crude people envy your class and polish. Accept their blunt praise with a smile instead of laughing at how they express it. Meanwhile, reasonable types like your roundabout logic, although it doesn't seem that amazing to you. Hey, it's just how your mind works. So you're kind of a celebrity just for being who you are. Now what? Get past the urge to give demos for tourists who want to peek under the hood. Make this start working for you at a higher level today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
