    "horoscope": "Don't push yourself too hard today. Your energy is high, but you're also more easily frazzled than usual. Don't be surprised by problems or delays in whatever you do now. These should be minor, but depending on your mood, they could be enough to frustrate and upset you. Avoid getting all worked up over unavoidable snags. Just proceed slowly, deal with issues as they arise, and keep your sense of humor about you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
