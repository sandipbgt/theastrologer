If you do have to sign a contract or make an important decision now, make sure you understand all the information before signing on that dotted line. Getting the perspective of a trusted friend or professional will help, too. Better yet, postpone the decision. Even just an extra day or two will help you get your thoughts aligned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
