The restless energy that fills you is the type that could make you stub your toe or miss your exit on the highway, because your thoughts are wandering. Do your best to concentrate, especially if you're working on something important. Slow and steady, dear!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
