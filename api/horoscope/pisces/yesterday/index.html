    "horoscope": "Your feelings are stirred up today -- wonderfully so. You're feeling things so deeply that even sadness seems precious! Your compassion for other people is also heightened now. This is true wisdom that comes from the universality of feeling. You can draw from your own life experiences to understand other people and their emotions. This enables you to reach out to someone with genuine empathy, which might be just what they need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
