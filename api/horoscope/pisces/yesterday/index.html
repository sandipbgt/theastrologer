    "horoscope": "The world needs your compassion today. Lots of people are feeling sensitive and easily upset now, or just melancholy. Your friends or coworkers may be on personal journeys of self-discovery -- journeys that are painful and difficult. Developing greater awareness of self and other is rarely easy! And that's where you come in. You can provide the sweet strength that people need right now -- the tenderness that can help them access their own softness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
