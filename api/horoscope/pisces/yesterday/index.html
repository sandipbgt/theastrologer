    "horoscope": "This promises to be an emotional day in the best kind of way. Exploring your feelings leads to greater self-understanding, which feels wonderful. It's an even bigger pleasure to connect on that level with a friend, and gain a greater appreciation for who they are at their core. If there's something deeply personal that you've been trying to work through, this is a great day to surge ahead in your personal development.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
