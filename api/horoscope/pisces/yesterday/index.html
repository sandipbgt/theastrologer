    "horoscope": "Generally, you're in a positive frame of mind -- as long as you rise above any stray feelings of confusion or discouragement. You're devising big plans in that dreamy head of yours, but do make sure they're feasible, and not just pretty illusions. Focus on concrete ways to help someone in need, but make sure you set good personal boundaries. Sometimes you're drawn to lost causes, Pisces. Break that habit today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
