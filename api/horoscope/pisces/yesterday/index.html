    "horoscope": "If you really care for someone, you'll make room for them in the boat. But don't throw yourself overboard into the deep. From the very beginning, you'll need to understand what they're here for. It's about sharing a little more of what you can give, not sacrificing everything you have, and it'll only be for a day. It's about soothing their fears, not smothering them with protection or denial. You can do this. It's totally within your skill set. It might even be your specialty. That's probably why this person came to you in the first place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
