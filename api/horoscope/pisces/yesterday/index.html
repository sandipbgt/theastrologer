If you try to reach out to someone on a feeling level, you may be met with cool logic instead of warm emotion. If so, don't let this worry you. For now, most folks are focused on taking care of business. Use this opportunity to do the same.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
