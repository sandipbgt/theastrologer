    "horoscope": "Today, you have staying power. Your energy comes in a steady stream and your emotions are gentle, like calm waters. You can manage even complex projects and problems because now you're centered squarely in the real world. There's little worry that you'll overextend yourself or wear yourself out by trying too hard to help everyone. Instead, you'll focus well, work hard and perform a task well done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
