    "horoscope": "Sometimes, your fertile imagination produces plans or ideals that just aren't made for real-world living. Though they're beautiful and convincing, they just wouldn't hold up to the light of day. But the utopian visions that are currently running through your mind are actually feasible. Instead of dismissing your ideas as nothing more than dreams, record them. You can use your far-seeing perspective to mold a plan for the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
