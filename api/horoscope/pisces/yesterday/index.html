    "horoscope": "You're more focused today than usual, or at least more alert. Hard work and long odds don't faze you, so this a good day to pursue a goal. You sense intuitively that you'll make it or break it on the strength of your own creativity -- and you're nothing if not creative! Just plan things out, if your goal is an important one. Impulsive moves may not work out well in the end.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
