    "horoscope": "You're incredibly big-hearted today, but focused, too. You're concerned for friends and strangers alike, and compassionate regarding their problems. You might end up giving someone advice today, or consoling them if they're upset. You don't mind nurturing others in this way. In fact, you're happy to help. And the person on the receiving end of your kindness certainly appreciates your efforts. You've helped them feel more secure, and that's priceless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
