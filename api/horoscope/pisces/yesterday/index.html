    "horoscope": "A tender connection with a loved one warms your heart today. Even a kind smile or gesture from a stranger reaffirms your sense that the universe is holding you in its embrace. The only trouble is, when you're this idealistic, the opposite also holds true: A harsh word from someone could flatten your spirits! Try to keep your chin up. Genuine compassion can neutralize almost any act of insensitivity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
