    "horoscope": "Think back to when you were younger and more innocent -- when you were a kid, maybe, or just when your eyes weren't yet opened to some of the world's harsher qualities. You can get back to that space today without much effort, because you remember just how it feels. This is the perfect time for mending fences with anyone with whom you've been on the outs. You can apologize and listen to their side of things. If there's no one to make up with, become a goodwill ambassador. Build bridges between diverse worlds.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
