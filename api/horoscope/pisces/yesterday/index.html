You can handle this space-out-of-time feeling, knowing as you do that what most of us call 'reality' is little more than a grand illusion. Take what you can from the old, but look forward to the new. Change is the only constant in life, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
