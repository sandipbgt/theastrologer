    "horoscope": "Many people are under the influence of deep emotional upheaval today, and some may react with jealousy, suspicion or manipulative behavior. On days like this, it's especially important for compassionate people like you to be as loving and forgiving as you can. This isn't to suggest you should allow yourself to be hurt or taken advantage of, but do recognize that everyone is operating under tension right now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
