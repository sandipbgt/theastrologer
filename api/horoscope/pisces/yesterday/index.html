This is no time to be a martyr -- instead, keep your perspective and admit that everything you give to others is your own choice. After all, you give so much because your heart is so big and full, which is wonderful. Instead of worrying that you're giving too much, try to reach out wholeheartedly to your favorite people. That way, you'll know you're connecting with someone deserving of your selfless efforts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
