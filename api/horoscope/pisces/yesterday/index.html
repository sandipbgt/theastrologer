No, you just stumbled into an empowerment session, and it's your turn to bathe in the good vibes. Oh, come on, don't say there's nothing for you here. Don't rack your brain for excuses. Check it out, OK? But instead of making it a quick once-over, take a long, slow look. Recognize that your long night of sadness is finally coming to an end. Happiness is dawning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
