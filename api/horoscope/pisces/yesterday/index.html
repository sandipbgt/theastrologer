    "horoscope": "Today it feels good to work on something tangible. Gardening, artwork and building things with your hands are all excellent for centering you in your physical self. The same goes for vigorous exercise. It's important to get out of your dreams and imaginings and into the real world now. Creative work is good, because it allows you to manifest your vivid imagination in a real-world form.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
