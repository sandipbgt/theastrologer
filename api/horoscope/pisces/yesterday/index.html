    "horoscope": "You're in a philosophical mood today. Your mind turns toward big ideas that could overwhelm you with their fascinating, nebulous quality. In fact, if you get a little lost in the realm of the mind, it's a good thing. You're quite creative now, not to mention idealistic. If you let yourself wander on a mental level, you'll come back around sooner or later -- and probably with a new theory or philosophy in place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
