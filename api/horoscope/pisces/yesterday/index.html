    "horoscope": "Generosity comes as naturally to you today as breathing. Everywhere you go, you're focused on making others comfortable. Be sure to extend some of this warmth toward yourself, too. You deserve the kind of devoted kindness you're showing to others! Spend as much time as possible at home now, or with people you know intimately. Your current energy is best suited for familiar places and faces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
