    "horoscope": "It's hard to concentrate when you have too many thoughts running through your mind. That's the situation you'll have to face today. Restlessness and distraction conspire, making it hard to take decisive steps forward in your work. You may have to accept that following a project through to completion just isn't in the stars today. Focus instead on gathering information. You can organize it later, when you're thinking more clearly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
