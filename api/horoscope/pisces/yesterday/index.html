    "horoscope": "You're drawn to bold personalities today, colorful folks with a flair for drama -- people whose bright energy makes you feel something intense. If you're viewing a movie or a play, you'll have a lot of fun. But if you're interacting with someone in person, it's important to remember that charisma is separate from integrity. It's fun to be dazzled by someone, but be wary of being swept off your feet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
