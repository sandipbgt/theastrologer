    "horoscope": "This is your day to take it easy. You've earned a break -- you've completed another personal lunar cycle, and now it's time to recharge. It's a great day for restful, low-key activities like napping, yoga, reading or writing. But if you're feeling more energetic than that, just listen to your body. You're good at tuning in to other people's feelings and needs. Today, tune in to your own, and honor them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
