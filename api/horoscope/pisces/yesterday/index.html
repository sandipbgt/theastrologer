    "horoscope": "Today is a very good day for turning your dreams and fantasies into a workable reality. Mine your imagination for brilliant ideas, not to mention rich sources of inventive energy. Normally you might have lots of ideas that you never pursue, but now you're focused enough to see if they might actually hold. A great way to keep this momentum going? Invite someone in on your ideas. Working together increases motivation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
