    "horoscope": "Taking a stand has always been difficult for you -- you're almost too good at seeing all sides of an issue and feeling compassion for others' needs and points of view. But today you need to stand up for yourself on an important issue. In the past, your noncommittal answers may have led others to play you for a fool. Well, the joke's on them. Now's your chance to show them how much you've grown and how strong you've become. Best of all, you can do this without making any new enemies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
