    "horoscope": "It's a good day to establish some kind of routine, if any area of your life is lacking in that regard. If you've been a bit careless lately about getting your work done or keeping your house clean, renew your commitment now to stay on top of those things. It's important to keep your life running smoothly. Doing so allows a clean, clear, open space for your imagination to roam!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
