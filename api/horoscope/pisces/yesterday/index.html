    "horoscope": "Sometimes you spend a lot of time in your head --  thinking thoughts that aren't very practical or realistic. But today, you're enjoying having your feet on the ground. It's a great time to have people over for dinner or to connect with an old friend on the phone. You're the perfect host -- as good a listener as always, and full of heart. Everyone will feel heard and understood, and do what they can to return the favor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
