    "horoscope": "Focusing on work or household chores is about the last thing you want to do today, unless your work involves beautifying your home or office. Creative endeavors are enjoyable, and it's easy to lose yourself in color and design choices. You're extra-sensitive to your friends' feelings and needs today, too. This is one of the things they love best about you, but don't overlook your own needs and opinions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
