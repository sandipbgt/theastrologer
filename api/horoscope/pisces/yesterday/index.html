    "horoscope": "Okay, so you're having a hard time. Something isn't going as planned, and you're feeling the urge to turn tail and run. But try not to get so upset over little challenges. That's what life's about: Face your issues so you can grow stronger and move on. If you stand up and test your strength this time, you're more likely to do so the next time some roadblock crops up. And it's not as if you have to do this alone. Ask a friend for backup.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
