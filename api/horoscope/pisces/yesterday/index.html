    "horoscope": "It seems like every effort you make today is thwarted. Everything you try to do is harder than expected; even minor successes come along with issues that need to be dealt with. Maybe your low energy is getting in the way of your success. If you aren't feeling a hundred percent, go easy on yourself. There's always tomorrow, and you're sure to feel better soon. You're sensitive by nature, so for now, don't put too much pressure on yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
