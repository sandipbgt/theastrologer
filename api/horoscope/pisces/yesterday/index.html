    "horoscope": "If you feel an urge coming on today, you'll probably do well to follow it. Spontaneous behavior can only benefit you right now. Your instincts are humming, so they shouldn't steer you wrong. And everyone is noticing your sweet, even-keeled nature. People are probably lining up to help you, or just to hang out with you; everyone wants a little bit of you to rub off on them. And why wouldn't they? For a brief moment, it's as if you're leading a truly charmed life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
