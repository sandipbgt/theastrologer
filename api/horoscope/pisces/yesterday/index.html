    "horoscope": "You can easily be swept up in the breakneck pace of life  today. You might feel as if your head is spinning! This is all very exciting, but it's a little too easy now to be reckless. Keep your wits about you, and make good, solid choices even if you make them quickly, on the spot. Above all, rely on your instincts. If something seems a little too risky, it probably is.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
