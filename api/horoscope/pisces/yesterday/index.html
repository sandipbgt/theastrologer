It's as if you can read between the lines in any conversation or encounter, and learn what's truly going on beneath the surface. This makes you a great listener, and a wonderful confidant for your friends. When they talk to you, they feel heard and understood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
