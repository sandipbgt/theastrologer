    "horoscope": "If someone close to you needs space today, do your best to let them go without protest, emotional or otherwise. The current energy is all about big, progressive ideas, and many folks do their best thinking in solitude. If you're in the mood for company, you can probably find a group that could use your help and input. Just don't expect warm fuzzies from your teammates. Right now, most people mean business!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
