    "horoscope": "You're misty-eyed about old, bittersweet memories. You're definitely feeling pushed in one direction and pulled in another, and it's bringing  troubled emotional reactions. For today, you may not know if you're coming or going. But look at it this way: At least you're here, feeling your way through life with that big, soft heart of yours. Just try not to take everything so seriously. Things will look a lot better in just a few days.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
