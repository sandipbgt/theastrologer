    "horoscope": "Generosity should be easy enough for you. You're calm and grounded yet still in touch with your higher purpose. You have so much to give, and there are so many needs to fill. Reach out to all those deserving people today, and don't worry about getting in their faces when you do it. Everyone needs to understand you're on a mission, because otherwise you'd just look like a pushover. This is only as personal as you let it get. Even the deserving people aren't obligated to accept, which just means that you'll have more to give someone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
