Spending time with someone you love could take on almost spiritual significance, because you're able to see that you aren't just two separate people; you're two souls, conjoined. If someone near you needs help, you'll do anything you can for them, selflessly disregarding your own comfort to come to their aid.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
