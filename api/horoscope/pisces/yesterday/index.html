And others may or may not share your plans for the future. So how can you get them all on the same page? You could beg, deliver inspirational messages or try to second-guess what's going to work for them. But in the end you just won't know until they speak or act. Change gently today, if you want more sympathy for your decisions. As long as you keep things friendly, it'll be OK.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
