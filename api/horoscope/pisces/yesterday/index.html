There are just so many matters to attend to, and so many people to talk to along the way! Take several breaks throughout the day, so you can take deep breaths and rejuvenate your energy. This will help you stay centered in an otherwise scattered day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
