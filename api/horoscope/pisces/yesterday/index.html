    "horoscope": "You're in the mood for romance today. But you're also quite idealistic, which could be a tricky combination. It's easy to get disappointed if you're hoping fervently for something that doesn't end up happening. So why not suspend all expectations, and just resolve to have a fun day? Gatherings with friends or family inspire a lot of warmth and laughter. And who knows? Maybe something lovely and unexpected will occur.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
