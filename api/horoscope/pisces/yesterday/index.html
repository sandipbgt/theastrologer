    "horoscope": "A certain situation has become too confusing for you to handle today. You're all too aware of the many different needs, feelings and agendas weighing in on the matter, and you genuinely want to please everyone. But it's time to be pragmatic. You know what the logical choice is. Making it will bring you serenity, even if it's met within the moment. Keep reminding yourself that this is better for everyone in the long run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
