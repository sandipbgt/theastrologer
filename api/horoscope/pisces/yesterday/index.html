    "horoscope": "Harmony in your relationships is especially important to you today. Enjoy your friends and loved ones, but do try to keep your boundaries in place. It's all too easy now to give in when you should take a stand, purely out of that need to keep the peace. But some things are worth fighting for. If an important issue comes up today, find it within yourself to hold your ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
