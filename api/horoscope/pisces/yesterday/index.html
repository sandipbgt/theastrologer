    "horoscope": "Today you're as attuned to your own and others' subconscious depths as you are to anything surface-level. Your emotional expression is wide-ranging, and you're able to perceive and understand other people's motivations better than usual. There's plenty of emotional manipulation going on now, and you can see it clearly. But that doesn't mean you have to participate in it. With this amount of clarity, you're above that type of behavior.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
