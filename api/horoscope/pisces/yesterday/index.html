    "horoscope": "You've always been well loved, but now everyone likes you even more because you're so soft-spoken and agreeable. You're interested in more than just your own agenda. Being selfish or seeking opportunities isn't your plan during this brief period -- but you're so pure of heart that this advantage doesn't even register on your radar. It's easy for you to draw plenty of support as long as you keep up this kind of goodness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
