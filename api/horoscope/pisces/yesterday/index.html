    "horoscope": "There's one thing about always having one foot in the sprit world: You're never quite here in the real world! Who were you before? Who are you now? Memory plays tricks on you today. It's hard to orient yourself right now, especially with all the characters who are flitting across your mind's eye. Don't begrudge anyone who has both feet on the ground. Maybe they could help straighten you out. Avoid drama.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
