For one thing, you enjoy knowing that you're needed. And you have so much to offer in terms of compassion for your loved ones. At work, you can combine intuitive reasoning with grounded energy to get a lot accomplished. Take advantage of this focus while it lasts!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
