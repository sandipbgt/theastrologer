    "horoscope": "You may feel pressure today from your employer, professor or some other source to attain impossibly high standards in your efforts. The current cosmic energy does highlight people's perfectionist streaks. But try not to let others' expectations cause you too much stress. The important thing now is to do your best, and be satisfied with that. Trying to exceed a reasonable expectation of achievement will just make you feel inadequate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
