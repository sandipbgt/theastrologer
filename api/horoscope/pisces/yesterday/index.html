    "horoscope": "Today marks the beginning of a new, month-long period of personal growth -- lucky you! Set a goal, such as a project you'd like to tackle or a habit you'd like to kick or develop, and start working toward it. The next phase of lunar influence will be an energetic one, so set your goals now.
