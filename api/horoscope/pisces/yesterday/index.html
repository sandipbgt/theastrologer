    "horoscope": "Take comfort in physical pleasures today. Good food nourishes your soul as well as your body, and a shared hug grounds you in everything that's important in life. This is a great day for getting some work done, because it's easy to stay focused. But be sure to relax, too. Sleep in a little late, go to bed early or mellow out on the couch with a good book.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
