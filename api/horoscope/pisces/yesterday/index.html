Perhaps most importantly, staying grounded in your sense of humor helps guard against any feelings of insecurity that would otherwise set in. The current influence could have you placing pressure on yourself to perform, but humor keeps things light.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
