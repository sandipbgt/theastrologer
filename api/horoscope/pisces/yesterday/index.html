Help this person out if you can, but don't feel bad if you can't. Sometimes, the best you can do is just to keep taking care of yourself. You can't be everyone's savior all the time. Be very selective in where and how you focus your energies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
