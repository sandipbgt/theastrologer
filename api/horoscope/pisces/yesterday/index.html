    "horoscope": "Your energy and emotions are wonderfully grounded today. A sense of inner serenity helps you meet any challenge calmly. If you have to put in extra hours at work, it's no problem. You have the stamina for it. The same goes for tough projects at home, including ones that involve physical labor. It actually feels good to stretch your muscles and throw your back into something worthwhile!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
