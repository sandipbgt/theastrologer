    "horoscope": "Your responsibilities fly out the window today as a goofy, affectionate mood takes over. Good thing your friends and coworkers are feeling playful, too! But don't take it personally if your boss gets on you for lacking focus. This isn't an attack, it's a reminder that you need to get back on track and buckle down. As sad as it may be, sometimes life is about doing things you don't feel like doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
