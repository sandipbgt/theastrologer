    "horoscope": "This is the sort of day that could give rise to an emotional catharsis. A friend might come to you with a secret that's been burdening them for some time. You're the perfect person to act as their confidant, since you're so compassionate. And you would never push anyone to come clean about something until they were ready. Your gentle, nurturing care could help someone grow stronger today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
