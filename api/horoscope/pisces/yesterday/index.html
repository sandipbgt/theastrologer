    "horoscope": "You're working hard, and that's a good thing. But temptations of relaxation keep whispering in your ear. If you can't afford a vacation just yet, hang in there. If you stay the course today, things will get a lot easier. In the meantime, helping other people in your life will really help lighten your load. There's no reason you have to do everything yourself. You've helped them enough to have some of that karma come back your way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
