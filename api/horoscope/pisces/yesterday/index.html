    "horoscope": "Your imagination is in overdrive today. Big ideas come fast and furious, each more compelling than the last. This is exciting, to say the least. And it's perfect for, say, brainstorming a creative project. But don't become too attached to any one brain wave just yet. Things are still developing. Even a firm philosophy could shift dramatically in the next day or two. So stay open to brilliant ideas, but avoid committing, for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
