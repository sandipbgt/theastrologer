On the outside, yeah, maybe you're going along with others because it's easier than taking a firm stance of your own. But inside, you're developing vision and strength, which could burst out of you any day now. Remember, though, that if people are used to you not having a backbone, it may take them some time to get used to the newer, stronger you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
