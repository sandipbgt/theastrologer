    "horoscope": "Do possibilities loom threateningly? Are strangers making you uneasy? Maybe you're thinking way too much about stuff you don't actually know for sure. Under less happy circumstances this could be slightly crazy-making, but luckily you'll be surrounded by familiar faces today. It's like a big, friendly fence going up between you and the unknown. Take advantage of your privileged spot in this eye of the storm. Take your time, adjust your attitude, and hope for the best. You'll be a lot more ready once you have to go out there again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
