    "horoscope": "Your energy is high today, and your mood a bit unsettled. You might find yourself talking to anyone and everyone you encounter. There's nothing wrong with being chatty, but you could end up feeling as if you've said too much without meaning to. Tactless comments slip out before you realize what you're saying. At least you're being honest. That counts for more than you realize.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
