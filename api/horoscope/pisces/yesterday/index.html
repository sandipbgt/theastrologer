    "horoscope": "If pessimism threatens your mood today, don't give in to it. Keep your chin up and find creative ways to reconnect with your honey or yourself. If you've been missing one-on-one time with your sweetheart, ask them out on a date, or cook a romantic dinner at home. If you've been skimping on alone time, take a long walk, go see a funny movie, or take a nap. Any of these should help you feel more happily centered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
