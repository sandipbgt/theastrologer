You should be striving toward your goals, supporting others along the way, and humbly asking the universe for help. Instead, you're hanging your head in defeat and calling yourself unprintable names. Hey -- even if you've hit a few snags recently, you're still deserving of all the success you've ever dreamed of. You'll soon take several solid steps closer to that dream.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
