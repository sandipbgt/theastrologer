    "horoscope": "Leadership may not be your thing. Still, today you feel a spark of motivation. Suddenly, you want to take the lead after all. You're feeling independent. You don't want anyone telling you what to do! It even feels good to make your own mistakes. At the moment, you trust yourself more than usual to work your way out of a tough spot. Use this energy boost to build on your newfound confidence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
