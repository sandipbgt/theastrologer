    "horoscope": "Can you feel that bubble of creativity swelling inside you? And you were all set to push it back down, weren't you? That would be wasting an incredible gift. Don't surrender to a fight-or flight-reaction. Devote this energy surge to art or design. But even as you make something that could last for years, pour your all into the moment's flow, instead of getting too sentimental about what happened in the past. Another piece of your life pattern will emerge today, and then this whole episode will make sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
