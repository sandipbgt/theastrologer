Nobody's needs or desires are frozen in time. Yesterday's all-knowing cockiness becomes today's joke about the mistakes you made. Keep that smile on your face as you look toward the future. You're the one who has to adapt to changing circumstances. Nobody else can do it for you. Another day of hard work should correct your course. Maybe then you can relax and pat yourself on the back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
