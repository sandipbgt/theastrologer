    "horoscope": "Be efficient in everything you do. Move forward on multiple fronts. Show creativity in every medium. Maybe this sounds impossible, but you'll be surprised how easy it could actually be. You already have the tools and supplies to make today special. All you need now is the faith to go for it. A little sympathy, applause or investment wouldn't hurt, either. See what your friends and neighbors are offering. And don't ignore that stranger who's taking an interest in what you're up to. You never know who it might turn out to be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
