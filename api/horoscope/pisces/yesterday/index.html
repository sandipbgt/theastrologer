    "horoscope": "If you're determined to get somewhere, go there without getting in people's faces. If you have to push against the crowd, make it feel like a massage or some other kind of pleasant physical encounter. They'll tolerate you if you tolerate them. Keep it real as you manifest gently today. By not pretending, you'll stir up a lot of healthy curiosity in this calm but irresistible force you're putting out. You'll grow a stronger team in the process, too, because once you have them hooked, they'll follow you anywhere.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
