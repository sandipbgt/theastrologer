    "horoscope": "You're drawn to groups of people today. Whatever you're up to, you're happier if you have a friend or coworker by your side. This is smart thinking, because teamwork is favored under the current influence. Even just connecting socially with others is good, because it strengthens your bonds and creates allies for later. It's even savvier to connect with folks who are actively trying to change the world for the better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
