But be aware that you might also run up against people who are reckless and spontaneous, people whose energy is even more powerful than your own. A very interesting dynamic could result! At least it should be fascinating, even if it's a bit intimidating. It might even inspire you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
