    "horoscope": "If anyone can talk their way out of a box, you're the one. You can spin words together to create a most charming defense or rationalization. But today, bland declarations and flimsy excuses fall flat. This is the time for honest debate. Engage in conversation and discussion, listening to others and explaining what you've learned. Don't bring one useless argument to the table. Let everything you say be filled with your wisdom and soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
