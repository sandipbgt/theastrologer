    "horoscope": "Spend time with your favorite people today. Social gatherings are a nice way to spend your time, as long as things stay pleasant. But if someone causes a scene, it could really upset you. You're sensitive by nature, and now you're especially thin-skinned when it comes to conflict. But perhaps you can turn that into an asset. If people are arguing around you, try to be the harmonizing force that reunites them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
