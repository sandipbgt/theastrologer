    "horoscope": "Let's hope you're in the mood to be social today. You'll probably have plenty of chances! Invitations come out of the blue. You might even have to do some juggling to fit in all the planned and unplanned appointments, meetings and get-togethers that arise. Don't forget to build in a little you-time. Otherwise you might give so much of yourself that you have no energy left for your own pursuits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
