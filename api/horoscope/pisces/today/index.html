    "horoscope": "If honesty is lonely, so be it. But maybe your opponent is telling the truth, too -- just their own version of it. You, of all people, should understand that perspective is subjective, and each person views the world through their own personal filters. If you're upset with someone now, don't hold on to the feeling. Admit and accept it, and then let it go. Releasing it is healthier, and will clear the way for future cooperation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
