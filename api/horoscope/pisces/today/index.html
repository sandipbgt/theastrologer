    "horoscope": "Your feelings are overwhelming today. Love is powerful and consuming. A simple hug could be an incredible experience. A heart-to-heart talk has the potential for breathtaking honesty. This is because you're at your best: a feeling creature, living deeply within your own, subjective experience. And yet, emotions are universal. Rather than isolating yourself within yours, you're able to use them as a bridge to reach out to others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
