Your energy is grounded, which may be a welcome relief, and you know just what you need to do on a project. Isn't it nice to be this decisive? Normally, you feel swayed by the needs and feelings of other people, but today, it's easier to make your choice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
