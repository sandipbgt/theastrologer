    "horoscope": "You have an unconventional perspective on life today. Anything new you learn now will hone the extensive understanding you already possess about human nature and the way the world works. Plus, you're more open than lots of people to unusual concepts and fresh perspectives. You can absorb new information with little difficulty, and make it your own. This is a real gift, gentle. Use it well!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
