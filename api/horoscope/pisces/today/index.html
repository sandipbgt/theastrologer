    "horoscope": "Today, the path of least resistance will almost certainly seem like the best resolution to any issue. You don't want to make waves. You'd rather deny your own needs than cause tension with a business partner or close friend. And yet -- aren't your needs important, too? Isn't your opinion as valid as anyone else's? Instead of backing down today, look for a way to compromise. Everyone can have their needs met.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
