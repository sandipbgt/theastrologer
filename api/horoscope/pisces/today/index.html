    "horoscope": "You're an intuitive person, and you're a healer. Today you may have an opportunity to use those gifts to better someone's life. If a friend needs comfort, advice or support, you're there to offer yours. And you can tell who's in need, without having to be told. That's one of the things your friends and family appreciate about you most. You always know when they're sad or worried, and you're always there to help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
