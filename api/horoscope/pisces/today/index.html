You're in a very affectionate mood, and you want nothing more than to spend time with beloved friends and relatives. But you're also quite sensitive to tension now, even more than usual. If you sense distance between yourself and a friend, do your best to reach out and bridge the gap. Demonstrate your willingness to meet them halfway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
