    "horoscope": "Lots of people have high energy today, including you. And everyone's talkative and opinionated, full of ideas and impressions. You're a sensitive sort, so try not to take it personally if someone says something tactless to you. They don't mean to hurt your feelings. They're probably clueless that they crossed a boundary at all! Chalk it up to exuberance and move on. This is a good growth opportunity for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
