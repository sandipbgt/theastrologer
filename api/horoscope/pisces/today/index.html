    "horoscope": "The status quo isn't really working for you at the moment, and you're harboring some contrary, resentful feelings about it. Bottling up your strange feelings will only make you feel worse, but taking chances isn't any more comfortable, is it? Today could be pretty confusing, so prepare yourself. Try not to read anything more into this than is really there. If you let yourself get mired in tension and uncertainty, you could convince yourself you're worse off than you are. Instead, take it easy. Soon you'll figure out the right thing to do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
