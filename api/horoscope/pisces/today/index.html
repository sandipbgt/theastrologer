You might even feel more and more frazzled as the day wears on, because you're trying so hard to chase down details that seem determined to elude your grasp. Remember to take deep breaths,. With such high energy and a clear vision of what you're trying to accomplish, today should be fun, not crazy-making.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
