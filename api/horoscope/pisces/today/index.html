    "horoscope": "Nurturing others comes naturally to you. Today's energy makes you even more loving and affectionate than usual. Even if you're feeling a little bit melancholy yourself, you're still willing to offer a sensitive ear to any friend who needs your support. That's your selflessness at work. You're big-hearted enough to set aside your own concerns in order to remind someone else that they have a true friend.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
