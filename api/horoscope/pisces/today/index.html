    "horoscope": "You feel excited today, mentally turned on and tuned in. It's as if you've tapped into a current of universal electricity that has switched on your mind like a light bulb. Your usual comfort needs don't apply now as much as usual. You aren't just open to new experiences, you're actively courting them! Unusual concepts hold great appeal, as do unfamiliar people and places. Enjoy all the excitement,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
