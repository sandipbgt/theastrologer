    "horoscope": "You make an excellent counselor today, whether to a friend, a child or a client. Your gentle kindness is just right for someone whose feelings are hurt. They know you'll treat them with care. It's also a good day to inspect your own feelings, with the same consideration you'd give to someone else. You can develop a great deal of self-awareness and understanding now, simply by feeling your true emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
