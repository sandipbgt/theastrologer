    "horoscope": "You're always emotionally intuitive, but today it's as if you absorb others' feelings. In a sense, this is a gift you can give to the world now. By taking on other people's emotions, you're lessening their burden. And you're certainly strong enough to carry it yourself. In fact, you're feeling more centered and strong than you have in a while. And helping others only makes you feel stronger.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
