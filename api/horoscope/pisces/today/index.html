    "horoscope": "You have your opinions, and there are days when you long to express them, even though you don't dare to. Today is different. Honesty and directness are in the, and you can't resist. Go ahead and be straightforward, but not harsh. Nobody needs dry criticism or unkind judgments now. You can be both truthful and pleasant today, and that will put you in a very good position in weeks to come.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
