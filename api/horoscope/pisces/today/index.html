You'll tune in to something -- an idea, a feeling, a frequency -- that could end up taking you far in a relationship with a good friend or in your career. Write down any ideas, no matter how vague they might seem; you'll build on them later. Most of all, follow your instincts!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
