    "horoscope": "It's a great day to explore your memories of the past, or mementos from long ago. Old letters, photos and journal entries hold a wealth of insight into the person you used to be and who you are now. Plus, it's fun just to steep yourself in thoughts of the old days. It's also a good day to call up a long-lost friend or ask an older relative about their childhood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
