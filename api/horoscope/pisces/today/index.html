    "horoscope": "A strong humanitarian urge may push you to do something today in the name of helping others. It's a great day for doing volunteer work or donating time or money to a charity. Just be sure to keep your personal boundaries firmly in place. Sometimes you take selflessness a little too far! Find the balance between helping others and letting them take advantage of your kind heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
