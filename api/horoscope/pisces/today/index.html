More than that, you trust your perceptions. You're used to strange, abstract ideas that other people consider wacky! You know better. Just because a person or a concept seems odd, that doesn't mean it's without merit. Seeing it is your gift today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
