There's a time and a place for progressive thinking, and it's here and now. Sometimes big ideas have to surge forward, regardless of who gets caught in the storm. Embody that kinetic energy and move forward with it. You could make great gains in a cause that's near and dear to your heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
