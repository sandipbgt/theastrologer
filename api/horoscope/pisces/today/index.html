    "horoscope": "Being alone just doesn't feel right today. You want the company of your favorite people -- those friends and loved ones with whom you share a deep, strong bond. And tension is the last thing you want to experience. You're sensitive to the least amount of discord. You'll do what it takes to create a pleasant sense of accord with the folks around you. You might even make compromises you probably shouldn't.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
