    "horoscope": "Today could be pretty uncomfortable. You're all too aware of the fact that some issues in your life need resolution or improvement. Yet your instincts are telling you to complain and boss other people around. If you're going to be a loudmouth, at least be motivated enough to take care of things instead of pawning it off on someone else. Match your words with actions, and be ready to trade your comfort for results. Don't worry. This won't last forever. In fact, things will be better soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
