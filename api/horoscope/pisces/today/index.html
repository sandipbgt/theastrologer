    "horoscope": "Whether your friends and family are in a good space right now or one of them needs some comfort or support, you have an instinctive grasp of their needs. They hardly even need to tell you their feelings or problems. Even if they're far away, you're able to tune in to understand how they're feeling, including any worries they may have right now. Let them know you're thinking of them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
