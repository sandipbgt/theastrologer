This is just the perfect moment to get absorbed in some project that really matters, whether it's about survival, community, art or love. Just don't let your sweet nature go sour, even when you're all about rolling up your sleeves and putting your world in order. All this ought to keep you out of trouble today, if trouble means situations that you'd rather not be in. Save your brilliant solutions for the fun stuff, OK?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
