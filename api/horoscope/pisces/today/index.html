    "horoscope": "Things are low-key, just the way you like it. Looks you've been handed a lucky moment -- a day of down time where you can relax and float between projects or problems. You can even be impetuous without offending anyone -- and how often does that happen? Don't expect to get a whole lot accomplished for a while, unless you focus on wrapping things up and tying off loose ends. In fact, prepare to spin your wheels a bit. That's okay -- you're good at grooving in one place for a while.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
