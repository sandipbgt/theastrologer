Plan out your approach so you don't get stuck going back to redo something you missed the first time around. A plan is like a road map: Even if you know generally where you're going and you'll get there eventually, you'll save time and fuel by charting your course!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
