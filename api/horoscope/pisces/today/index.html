There's an easy fix for that: Don't think about it! People are doing their own thing today, even if they're working together in groups. Everyone is independent-minded now; that's just the energy that's swirling around at the moment. You should do your own thing, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
