    "horoscope": "It's good to speak plainly when you're trying to work out a problem. That way, your intentions are clear to everyone and you can exchange ideas more effectively. Still, be considerate of others' feelings and ideas, especially those who come from different backgrounds than your own. Most of us speak vastly different languages, you know, even if the words coming out of our mouths are the same. And you're all stuck together today. You may as well get along, and you're just the person to lead the effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
