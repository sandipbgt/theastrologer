But no -- they have to go announcing their many different needs and opinions all over the place. Suppose you stop fretting about their lax discipline? You're the one who told everybody to chill out, after all. Why not give it another day before you get all upset? You'll feel better by then. This is just a passing phase.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
