Someone could really benefit from the way you view business or friendships, and anyone who understands your genius will soon be following your example. Don't let the idea of that make you uncomfortable! Today brings you the unique opportunity to make a difference. Take that opportunity and run with it. There's nothing to be nervous about; if you put your heart into this, only good can come of it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
