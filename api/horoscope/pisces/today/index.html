    "horoscope": "Analysis goes only so far. Even the most straightforward thinking can tie you up in knots if you try to weave too many strands together. Elusive things will keep you looking for more evidence. Tricky little non-things will just keep you wondering today. Future forward people might have some difficulty pulling in genuine visions through the static of random hallucinations. Turn to your loved ones at times like these. They can offer you the ideal reality check. If you can hold it in your hand and feel it in your heart, you're probably good to go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
