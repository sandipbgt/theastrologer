    "horoscope": "You may feel a special connection with nature today. It's a good time to get outside, if the weather permits. You can also enjoy this grounded energy in other ways, such as committing yourself to steady work on a project. It feels good to move step by step through a process toward a tangible goal. Build something with your hands. The possibilities are endless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
