    "horoscope": "Today you're blessed with a very special energy, one that opens up your heart and softens up your compassion. Still, it's good to stay composed, even as you revel in the bliss of this sweetness. If you stay alert and play this right, you'll gain far-reaching benefits beyond your imagining. At the very least, commune with someone special or offer your warmth and sensitivity to someone in need. And whether you're spending time with family or in your own pleasant company, don't waste a single, precious moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
