    "horoscope": "Wanderlust sets in today. Familiar people and places don't appeal. You want to strike out into unknown territory! This is wonderful, as long as your courage and excitement last. But you might end up in the position of being all alone in unfamiliar surroundings. This can apply to intellectual pursuits as well as social groups and geographical areas. But a sense of faith in the universe should pull you through any uncomfortable spots.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
