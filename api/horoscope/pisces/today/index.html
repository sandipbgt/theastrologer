Indulge this on any level that seems appropriate. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination. The sublime and the ridiculous are equally appealing now, so whatever happens today, it's sure to keep you laughing. Don't you love this type of learning and growing?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
