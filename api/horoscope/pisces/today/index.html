    "horoscope": "Your escapist tendencies are heightened today. This could be a positive thing or a challenging one, depending on how you channel your energy. Any creative work you do now is a good thing, because it helps you express yourself -- which may not be so easy if you're just trying to explain your thoughts or feelings. Taking in art or listening to music is also a good idea now, because it soothes your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
