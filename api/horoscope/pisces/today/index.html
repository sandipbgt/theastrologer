    "horoscope": "You might spend much of today lost in fantasy. Reading books and watching movies are good activities now. They stimulate your mind as well as indulging that escapist part of your soul that wants to explore imaginative realms. Creating your own imaginative realm through writing or music is also a wonderful way to spend your time. Above all, let your thoughts wander where they will. The true adventure is in your head.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
