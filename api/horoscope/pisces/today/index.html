    "horoscope": "It's easier today than usual to concentrate on the task at hand. It's important to focus on the bottom line in all you do. Find the most practical, efficient and sensible way to complete a project. Trim any excess from your spending habits or your diet. Emphasize the things you know are virtuous and just, such as eating well, working hard and living up to your commitments and responsibilities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
