You're drifting through life in your usual state of dreamy wonder, despite the serious atmosphere surrounding you, and it'll be hard to keep your feet on the ground. At least everyone who knows you knows what to expect, so they'll be tolerant if you seem a little spaced out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
