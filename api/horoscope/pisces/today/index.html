    "horoscope": "Today you have a vision -- a beautiful idea of the future, of a better world that you can help create. Keep this image in mind as you go throughout your day. And look for opportunities to make it a reality. After all, it's fine to dream of a better life, but in the end, it doesn't mean much if you don't attempt to create it. Blend vision with action. Make something of your dreams.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
