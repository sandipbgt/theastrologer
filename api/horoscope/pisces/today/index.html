    "horoscope": "You're especially susceptible today to artistic influences. Your own creativity is especially strong under the current influence. If you're an artist, a writer or a musician, your muse can assist you in producing works of incredible imagination. Others' works of art also hit you at a deep level. It's a good day to spend time with creative people. Some of that visionary energy is sure to rub off on you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
