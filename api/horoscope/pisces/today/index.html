    "horoscope": "As one of the most spiritual signs of the zodiac, you're close friends with the great beyond. But today you're more otherworldly than ever. Your spirit is aroused in a way that can only be satisfied by spiritual or religious observances. So meditate, light a candle, attend a church service -- in any way that's meaningful to you, take a few moments to be reverent. This will make the rest of your day go more smoothly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
