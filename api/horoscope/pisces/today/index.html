    "horoscope": "You're at your most giving, generous best today. Your needs take a back seat to what other people are going through right now. You may not even be aware of an issue in your own life. You're just focused on helping others, and absorbing their emotions so they don't have to bear them alone. This is a wonderful gift, especially if you have children. But remember that you deserve help and nurturing, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
