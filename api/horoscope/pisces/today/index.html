Even if you're stuck at work, it's nice to look out the window or connect with the natural world through your imagination. Spending time with people you care about is another good way to take advantage of this smooth, grounded energy. You're even warmer and more loving than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
