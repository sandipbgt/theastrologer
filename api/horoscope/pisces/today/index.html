    "horoscope": "You're feeling passionate, but it's hard for you to decide how much of it you should show to others. After all, you don't want to upset anyone or push them away. So, timidly, you put one toe across the border, and then another, and then a whole foot. It gets easier for the rest of you to follow after that, especially as you start to realize you might actually be welcome here. Why not try making bigger, bolder gestures? Go ahead and act on those passions. This could get really exciting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
