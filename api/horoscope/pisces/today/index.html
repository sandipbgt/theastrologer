    "horoscope": "Sometimes you feel so wishy-washy and indecisive, but not today. You're still quite sensitive to others' needs and feelings, but you're more emotionally grounded than usual. Thus, you're able to be persistent, even when making tough decisions that you'd normally shy away from. This is your inner strength shining forth, gentle! Doesn't it feel good to know you can step up to the plate when you need to?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
