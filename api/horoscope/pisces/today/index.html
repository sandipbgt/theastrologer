    "horoscope": "Working efficiently is no problem today. You aren't distracted or confused, and it's easy to see what's most important in any given situation. Your ability to focus is heightened, so take advantage. It's a great day for tedious tasks like balancing your checkbook or researching the best way to save money. Chores like this even bring you pleasure, because you know you're providing for yourself and your loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
