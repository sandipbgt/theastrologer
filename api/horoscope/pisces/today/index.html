While people around you may be moody or even grouchy, you're able to take your emotions in stride, because you don't judge them; you simply feel them, letting them pass through you likein a river. It's a good day for a date with a friend, or even just a few precious moments spent alone. Close your eyes and daydream. Treat yourself to an imaginative fantasy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
