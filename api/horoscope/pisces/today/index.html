    "horoscope": "You like tidy solutions under ideal conditions. Yes, and pigs will fly, too! But you could spend some time with airborne farm animals today as your vivid daydreams overlap your active, physical life. No one else can see these projections or illusions, so they'll probably wonder why you're flapping your arms as you soar with your imagination. And even if it isn't taking you to such silly places, this is going to be a solo flight. Involve others at your peril. They might not react well if you keep insisting on something they just don't get.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
