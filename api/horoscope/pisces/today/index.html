    "horoscope": "You have so much energy now that you may feel scattered and incapable of making a solid decision. There's an easy fix, though: Find one project to focus on -- say, cleaning the kitchen, or clearing out a closet -- and attack it with vigor. Physical work will help you focus, which in turn will help clear your head. Then you'll be able to tackle the bigger, more important jobs that are still on your list.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
