    "horoscope": "Ordinarily your emotions are in charge, but today, your body takes over. Now you're a creature of physical ability and pleasures. Increased endurance enables you to work or exercise for an extended period of time. Anything that uses your muscles is extra nice. Stretching feels so luxurious! You may also notice you're especially attuned to temperature or texture. Whatever your body demands, satisfy it. Feed your physical desires, just for a day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
