    "horoscope": "You're in an industrious frame of mind today. It's easier than usual to spot the bottom line, which helps in determining your next step. No matter what you're doing, your emphasis should be on being practical and conserving resources. Time, effort and money are precious, and right now you have good ideas on how to maximize them. Put those ideas to good use as you move throughout your day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
