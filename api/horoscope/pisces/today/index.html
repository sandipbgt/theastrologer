But today, you'll have an extra-sensory edge that lets you understand all kinds of things you weren't aware of even a day ago. Be sure to use this heightened sensitivity. You could help friends or coworkers hash out an issue they're having, or zero in on someone nearby in need of your help. Whatever happens now, no one can hold you back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
