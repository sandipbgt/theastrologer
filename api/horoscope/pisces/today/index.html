    "horoscope": "You, better than almost anyone, know how to be outspoken without raising your voice. Use that talent today to produce ideas and solve any problems that have cropped up in your work or finances. Brainstorming with other people produces the best results, so keep everything congenial. You can share and test out your hypotheses together. Soon, when it's time to tackle life head-on once again, you'll have all the best ideas and tools for reaching a satisfactory conclusion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
