    "horoscope": "Soft of heart -- that's you, in a nutshell. And you've always been a sucker for others' dramas, even when you're able to view their situations objectively. For today, you'll be the perfect mixture of these two facets of yourself. You'll be able to help a friend with their sadness simply by being yourself, and reaching out to them with a friendly ear and a soft, welcoming shoulder.
