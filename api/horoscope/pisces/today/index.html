    "horoscope": "A peaceful sense of stability steals over you today. The current cosmic energy has you feeling emotionally grounded, making it easier than usual to stick to the task at hand. You have a clear sense of the rules or expectations in any given situation, so following them is a breeze. You can also be timely or stick to a budget, because you're more aware than usual of resources like time and money.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
