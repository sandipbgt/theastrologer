You can tell when someone is feeling lonely or needy, even if they don't breathe a word of their feelings. And their emotions don't frighten you. You need other people, too. So reach out and make that all-important connection. Strengthen your bond.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
