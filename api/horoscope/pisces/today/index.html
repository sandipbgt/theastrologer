    "horoscope": "Compassion is a crucial part of leadership, and few people understand that better than you. You know you don't have to charge out and force yourself onto other people in order to make a difference. You'll make great things happen just by listening to their concerns. Extend yourself in this way today. Lend an ear to people in need. It's a real gift for them, but it also gives you input for correcting your course or redefining your goal. Soon you can start a new project or continue an existing one with a greater understanding of the stakes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
