    "horoscope": "Yesterday's intense emotions continue today. These could range from longing to melancholy to passion and beyond. But whatever you're feeling, it's impossibly sweet, because this is you in your most intense and distilled form: a creature of pure emotion. Just remember that feelings are subjective. In a day or two, or even an hour or two, yours are likely to change. Enjoy this ride, but don't take it too seriously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
