    "horoscope": "Kindness goes a long way in many situations. You understand this better than most. But sometimes it's important to stand up for yourself or your beliefs, even if doing so disrupts the harmony you prize so dearly. Today, you may have to make a choice: Will you take the passive route in order to keep the peace, or put your foot down and risk discord? If you're in doubt, seek the middle ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
