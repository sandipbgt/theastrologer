    "horoscope": "Be bold today. No, daredevil stunts aren't really in your nature, and they may not be a good idea now, either. But the current energy boosts your self-confidence, not to mention your energy. It's easier than usual to take a chance, because you feel optimistic about the outcome. Of course, other people are also feeling bold and competitive now. You may prefer to just sit back and watch someone else in action!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
