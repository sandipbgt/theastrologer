    "horoscope": "You just want to get along with everyone today. You can tell when someone near you is getting upset or worked up over something, and you'll do what it takes to keep them calm and happy -- even at your own expense. Your kindness and selflessness are two of your best qualities, but they may work overtime today. It's all too easy now to let someone take advantage of your compassion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
