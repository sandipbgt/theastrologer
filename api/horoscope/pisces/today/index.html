    "horoscope": "You're like a child on their first trip to an amusement park -- wide-eyed, slightly frightened and very easy to impress. But not to worry, because nobody's taking advantage of you. Turn this into simple, pure appreciation of the wonderful life you lead. You're tuned in to the world's miracles, both large-scale and minor, and you may feel as if your heart is bursting with joy. Your receptive state of mind is ideal for learning, and you could surprise yourself with all you take in today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
