    "horoscope": "Compassion is part of your daily experience; it's who you are. Today, this empathetic quality is on high. Your intuitions are strong and sure. You may feel others' feelings as acutely as if they were your own. At the very least, you're probably able to sense someone's sadness or anxiety. This puts you in a great position to help them through their troubles, simply by offering them a kind word or a gentle hug.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
