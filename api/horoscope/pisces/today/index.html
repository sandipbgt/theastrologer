Know this, at least: Any former divisions between private and public don't matter now. When you're talking with your neighbor, don't worry about revealing too much about your emotional state. You're sweet and sympathetic enough that other people will want to treat you with the same kindness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
