    "horoscope": "You may feel pressure today from your employer, professor or some other source to attain impossibly high standards in your efforts.

Trying to exceed a reasonable expectation of achievement will just make you feel inadequate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
