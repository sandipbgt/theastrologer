This is both a gift and a burden: It helps you understand and relate to just about anyone, but you have to be very careful to set strong personal boundaries. Offer your kindness and attention to someone who needs it. But don't overextend yourself, and don't be afraid to ask for some compassion in return.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
