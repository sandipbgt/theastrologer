    "horoscope": "Expect steady, mellow emotions today. You feel inwardly secure, which makes the whole day run more smoothly. This is the kind of mood in which you know you can handle anything that might come up. Still, there are tools you can rely on if life gets a little hectic. Remember that methodical, tried-and-true systems work well now -- much better than trying to invent new solutions to old issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
