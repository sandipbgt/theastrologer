    "horoscope": "If going with the flow means going for the gold, you could easily strike it rich. There is a catch, however. In this case, you may have to pay a price if you can't navigate carefully. But that's just the part you can see. Don't get too sloppy with all the undercurrents surging through your experience. You might overflow your boundaries today, flooding other people's acreage with something too rich and extreme for them to handle. Clouding these waters won't help anyone see the light. And not much can grow without light.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
