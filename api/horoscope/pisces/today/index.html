    "horoscope": "If you feel yourself slipping or faltering, push yourself harder than usual to keep going. Watch what you do here. Extreme actions will make waves. At first it'll be exciting to surf this moving seascape, but there will be strong undercurrents, too. And you'll be uncomfortably aware of these today. Don't worry too much about that. Since you're the one who started everything sloshing around, it's good to be in touch with it on all levels. You're already developing a real awareness of your place in the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
