    "horoscope": "If things feel a little bumpy today, don't take it too much to heart. This is just a brief, minor rough patch -- and one that might exist more in your insecurities than in reality. Just keep reaching out to people who are important in your life, and let them know how much you care. If that seems like too much, then spend the day alone. Maybe you need to reconnect with yourself before you'll be able to connect with anyone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
