    "horoscope": "If you're not sure where to turn, that's because uncertainty is everywhere. Being two-faced now would just make it worse, even though it's natural to divide your loyalties, or put them on hold while you're still checking out the options. People might already be badgering you to join up, sign up, or invest in whatever they claim is best for you. But don't cave yet, OK? Stand up to the pressure today. Stay on message even if it means an emotional disconnect. In some cases it's better not to get involved, anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
