    "horoscope": "Your intuition and instinct are both running strong today. Now you can connect with others, because you're reading between the lines with real insight. Listen to what they're saying on the surface, too. It's important to keep emotions and logic engaged now, so you'll know both the why and the how. This is also a good time for tending to things at home. Spend time with pets or loved ones, or simply enjoy your solitude. Record your ideas and dreams in a journal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
