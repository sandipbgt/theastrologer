    "horoscope": "Today might be your favorite kind of day: one that is slow-paced, relaxed, and full of creative inspiration. You're feeling especially tuned in to the emotional or even mystical side of life. Your instincts are on high. It's easy to read between the lines during conversations with other people, because you're adept at sixth-sense communication -- the kind that reveals what someone is feeling without having to be told.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
