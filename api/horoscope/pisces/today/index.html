    "horoscope": "You're feeling scattered, excitable, and not in the mood for limits. Maybe you want to sleep in instead of setting the alarm, or party too late at night. The problem is, you're sensitive by nature. The more you indulge, the worse you'll feel. There is something you can do about it, though -- take a day or two to abstain and spruce up your image. You'll feel a lot better, and other people will notice and appreciate the change.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
