    "horoscope": "Your energy is wonderfully grounded today, and it's much easier than usual to focus on mundane tasks. Take this opportunity to get caught up on the duties in which you may usually fall behind, such as filing papers or paying off bills. Financial responsibilities are highlighted under the current influence, so it may be a good time to revisit your budget and make sure you're living within your means.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
