    "horoscope": "You feel wonderfully grounded and capable today. You have a firm grasp on what you'd like to accomplish, and how you intend to do so. Just remember, today's focus should be on budgeting your resources. Don't think you have to say 'yes' every time someone asks you for help or input. Learning to say 'no' sometimes is part of being a sensible, levelheaded person. Thank goodness, this lesson comes easily today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
