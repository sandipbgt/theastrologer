    "horoscope": "Today's energy is perfect for good times with your favorite people. There's a wonderfully easygoing vibe in effect. Most folks are in the mood for pleasure. No one wants to argue or experience discord. Even moving too fast is unpleasant! This is all about taking it easy and enjoying yourself. For your part, generosity plays a big part in this. You love knowing that you've ensured others' comfort and happiness. Remember your own, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
