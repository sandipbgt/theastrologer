    "horoscope": "Welcome to a warm, enjoyable day. You're feeling affectionate, appreciative and enthusiastic. But if the spotlight turns your way, do your best to be discreet! It's easy to get so passionate and eager that you end up overstepping your boundaries in some way -- sharing too much information with a stranger, perhaps, or bragging about something you'll later wish you'd kept quiet. Play it cool,. Keep your cards close to your chest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
