    "horoscope": "You have a lot more energy today than usual. You might even jump out of bed this morning, raring to go! It's important to direct this energy, so you don't burn out too early. If you channel it carefully, you can get a lot accomplished. But try not to waste it on impulsive moves. Think through your steps before you act, so that every move counts, and nothing you do is in vain.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
