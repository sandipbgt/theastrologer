    "horoscope": "Your urge to connect with loved ones surfaces in a big way today. You're accommodating with everyone now, but especially the people you know best and trust most. You want to show them your devotion in measurable ways -- a strong, warm hug, or a meal you make yourself. It's a great time to gather friends and family at your home for a fun, relaxing get-together. Emphasize comfort and unity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
