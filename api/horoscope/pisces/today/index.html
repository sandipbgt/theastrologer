    "horoscope": "Sometimes you enjoy spending time in your own fantasy-land, drifting through your imagination. But now it's time to relax your guard and let in some outside influences. Connect with the world around you. People will be pleasantly surprised by your creative outlook, and they'll want to get in your corner. Don't miss out on the opportunities that arise from these unexpected allies. With friends on your side, you can make anything happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
