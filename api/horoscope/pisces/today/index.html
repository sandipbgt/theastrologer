You know the importance of appearance. Looking good is an art form for you. Today, look past any illusions, and find out what's going on in the real word. It's not all that bad, you know. Expect the worse and that's what you'll find. Expect the best and you'll find it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
