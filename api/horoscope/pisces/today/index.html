    "horoscope": "Your intuition receives a boost today. Reading other people is all about tuning in to their body language, their facial expression and what they're not saying, as well as what they are. All of these elements and more make up a whole, feeling person. If you listened only to the words people said, you'd never get the full picture! Using your depth of insight sensitizes you to someone's innermost feelings and needs.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
