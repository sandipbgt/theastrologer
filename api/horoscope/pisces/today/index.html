Yes, the rules are clearly on your side for now. The sky's the limit, thanks to your high standards and stratospheric expectations, but keep your head out of the clouds. Oh, and be sure you're getting enough oxygen up there, too. Forgive anyone who falls short. You'd gain nothing by dropping down on them out of the blue.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
