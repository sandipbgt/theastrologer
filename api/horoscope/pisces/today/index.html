You love staying in touch, but all this back-and-forth takes a lot of energy! It may be difficult to stay organized and on task today, since there are so many distractions. Just do your best. Turn off your phone or ignore your email, if you need a break.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
