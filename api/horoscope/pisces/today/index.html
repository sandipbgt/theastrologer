    "horoscope": "Life feels sweet, fun and enjoyable today. You have a solid sense of yourself and what's important to you. You know who your real friends are -- and they're many. This makes it easy to relax and let any petty worries go, so you can simply enjoy your day. Working hard comes naturally now, and you can get a lot accomplished. That makes 'playtime' even more fun!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
