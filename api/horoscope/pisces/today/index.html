    "horoscope": "You're feeling plenty energetic, yet your instinct is to withdraw from the rigors and chaos of everyday life. Ordinarily you might feel stifled, but now you just feel safely sheltered. It's comforting sometimes to take a breather, isn't it? And today represents the alone time you've really been needing. So use it well. Concentrate on something you've had on your plate for a while, such as getting your finances in order. This is the perfect time to do what needs to be done in order to clear the decks for something brand new. It's coming soon!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
