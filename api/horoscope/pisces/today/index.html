These sterling qualities of yours have translated into rewards for everyone, including real success for you. In fact, you're securing your own support for the future. Right now, you don't need it, but when you do, it'll be there. That's got to be a good feeling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
