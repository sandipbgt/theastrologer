    "horoscope": "Today, the thoughts and feelings you experience could end up resonating with you for a long time. You're even more attuned to emotional vibrations than usual. It's as if you can read between the lines in any conversation or encounter, and learn what's truly going on beneath the surface. This makes you a great listener, and a wonderful confidant for your friends. When they talk to you, they feel heard and understood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
