    "horoscope": "Other people see you as nave. You're even more aware of it today than usual. You feel rather confused about the state of your life. The good news is you're aware that this is nothing more than a brief adjustment period. A project you've been working on may need some analysis to get it back on track. Or your finances might need attention. Whatever's on your plate, don't fret over it. Just jot down some notes and trust that things will be fine. Soon, you'll be playing with a full deck once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
