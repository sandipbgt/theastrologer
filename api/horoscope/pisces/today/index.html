You have an opportunity to deepen your self-awareness through self-expression. But you also might make a declaration that you believe utterly in the moment, only to change your mind later on. Oh, well -- perhaps that's part of the journey.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
