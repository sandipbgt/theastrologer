    "horoscope": "Your natural level of emotional sensitivity is high, but today it's heightened even further. You might experience subtle vibrations when you're around other people -- your own 'sixth sense' that cues you in to how they're feeling. You're especially sensitive to sadness and anxiety in this state. There's a fine line between helping others and taking on their burdens as your own. Do your best to stay on the right side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
