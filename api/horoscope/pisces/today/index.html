    "horoscope": "Today is your day. You're beautifully in your element, emotionally at one with the world around you. You take on others' trials and heartbreaks as your own, as well as their joys. When a friend cries, you cry with them; and you feel their pleasure or gratitude just as keenly. Even feelings of melancholy are precious now. Living within emotion is who you are, and what you were made to do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
