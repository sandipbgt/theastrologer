Even if the other person is far away from you, you sense their presence as if they're right next to you. Your intuition is stronger now than usual, so use it to tap into your most intimate relationships. Connecting with a friend or your spouse is healing for both of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
