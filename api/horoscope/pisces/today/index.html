    "horoscope": "Step away from the mirror. Walk on solid ground instead of hot. This is sure to be uncomfortable for you,. After all, reality is boring at best, unbearable at worst. But sometimes, you have to reconnect with your true self. You have to recognize and own the real state of your life, even if that's uncomfortable. And you can't do that if images obscure the truth. Get ready for a day of unease, and trust that you'll come through this smarter and more in tune with yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
