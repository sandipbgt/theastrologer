    "horoscope": "Your usual compassion and sensitivity deepen today into a sense of intimate connection with your loved ones. Even if you're far away from someone who's dear to you, you can feel their presence as if they're next to you. This is a wonderful time to reach out to someone you care about. Your devotion runs strong and true; you're passionately invested in others' feelings and needs. You can serve someone now with selfless dedication.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
