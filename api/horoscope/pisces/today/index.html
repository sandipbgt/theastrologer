    "horoscope": "You were so thirsty for more that you went there again, didn't you? Instead of stirring up your imagination with desire, try keeping your fantasies pure for today. Others can feel the energy you broadcast, even if you're not openly staring at them. Laugh about that if you want, but it's true. You'd feel it if someone was studying you from a distance, too. But none of this is helping you. It's time to ground yourself in structured, purposeful reality. Be happy where you are. Accept what is. Love the one you're with. Change will happen in its own time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
