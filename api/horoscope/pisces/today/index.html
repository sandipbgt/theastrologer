    "horoscope": "Like a lot of people, you're full of energy and courage today. You're filled with the brash power of the universe. You want to use it to its greatest advantage! And there's nothing wrong with that. The trouble comes when you make hasty decisions that lead to careless acts. It's easier than usual to make mistakes. It's that whole leaping-without-looking thing. At least this is a good opportunity to build your independence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
