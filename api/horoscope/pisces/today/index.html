    "horoscope": "Your ego drives are low today -- not that they're ever very high. You, more than most, tend to tune in to other people's wants and needs. Now, you're in a loving mood, and you hope for closeness. You're willing to accommodate someone's wishes if it makes the time you spend with them more harmonious. You can also help someone through a difficult emotional time now, because you're even more compassionate than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
