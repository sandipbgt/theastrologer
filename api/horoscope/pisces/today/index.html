It's a wonderful day to do something either physically or emotionally intense, or both. Get some one-on-one time with your sweetheart or share a long talk with a close friend. Even a vigorous workout feels great today, especially if it's done in or near. By the end of the day, you feel cleansed from the inside out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
