    "horoscope": "You want to please everyone, especially today. But that may not be possible -- unless, of course, you're willing to forgo your own wishes to fulfill someone else's. Putting your own needs last is okay when it comes to your children, or when your needs truly aren't that important. But when it comes to working out larger issues with your equals, don't be so quick to back down. Surely there's a way to balance this out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
