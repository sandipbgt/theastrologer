    "horoscope": "Your idealism could be punctured by the harshness of common sense. Reality can be so brittle, can't it? It's no wonder you prefer your dreams and illusions to 'real' life.

Understanding other people helps you communicate and negotiate with them more effectively.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
