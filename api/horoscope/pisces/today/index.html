    "horoscope": "Sometimes you're not great with money, but today your high energy could translate to a lucky streak. Ride it out as long as you can, but be smart -- it can't last forever. If it doesn't happen at all, then count your blessings. Sometimes, squeaking by is better than dealing with even short-lived fame and fortune. A sudden windfall would bring opportunists to your door, and you know how hard it is for you to resist a good sob story.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
