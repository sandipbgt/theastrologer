    "horoscope": "This is one of those wonderful days when you feel relaxed and grounded. Life seems manageable. You know what you're working toward and why, and you're sure of the steps it'll take to get there. Tackle a project requiring focus, because you're more clear-headed than usual and you're capable of sustained effort. Eat nutritious foods and do some walking or yoga to increase the sense of being grounded in your body.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
