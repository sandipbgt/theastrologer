    "horoscope": "You're filled with restless energy today, and it's hard to focus on the task at hand, much less make important decisions. If you have a list of errands to run, you should be fine. You'll even have fun chatting with other people in the checkout line at the grocery store. But it could be hard to concentrate at work, unless your only duties are returning emails and phone calls.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
