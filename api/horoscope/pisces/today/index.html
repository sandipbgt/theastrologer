    "horoscope": "This is the perfect time to steal some introspective time. Hole up someplace comfortable and dream to your heart's content. This is your chance to envision a beautiful life for yourself.  In your mind's eye, create a safe haven of a home, or the perfect, nurturing relationship. That way, when you're ready to share your thoughts, you can start working to make those dreams a reality. It'll be easier than you think -- you'll see.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
