    "horoscope": "Attend parties and other gatherings now, because you're in the mood for company. Just make sure you don't get carried away with fantasies about anyone you meet, because you're in a highly romantic mood, and it's easy to slip into a rosy daydream that doesn't reflect reality. That doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy talking with friends both new and old; just don't read anything into the conversation that isn't there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
