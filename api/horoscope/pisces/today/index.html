    "horoscope": "You're sensitive to subtle vibrations -- you're aware when your friend's mood changes from upbeat to pessimistic, for example, or your spouse is worried about something. It's easy for you to absorb these emotions and feel them as if they're your own, which is both a gift and a burden. Focus today on connecting lovingly with other people but also maintaining a personal boundary so that you don't have to soak up their feelings like a sponge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
