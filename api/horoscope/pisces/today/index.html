    "horoscope": "Your friendships and other interpersonal connections take center stage today. People may not seem quite as warm as you'd prefer, but don't take that to heart. They're probably just wrapped up in their own pursuits. That's the kind of energy that's swirling around today. Many people are so preoccupied, they simply forget to connect in their usual, warm manner. Perhaps that's a contribution you can make: gentle kindness on a busy day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
