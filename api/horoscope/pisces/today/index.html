    "horoscope": "You know what's good for you, and that puts you ahead of the game. But can you really say what's best for somebody else? Rethink your urge to force-feed, because that's where sensitivity ends and tyranny begins. And you certainly don't have to push yourself out onto that slippery slope. If your reservoir of good will is overflowing, why not dump some of that charity on those who actually want it? And maybe those who actually need what you're offering will finally put in a formal request. Wait for it and earn their respect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
