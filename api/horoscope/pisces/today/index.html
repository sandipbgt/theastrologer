Your best results will come from making a plan and sticking to it. Unless, of course, you need to revise it part way through! In that case, your flexible nature will help you switch streams and find a better course. Just keep reasonable limits in mind, and you'll find success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
