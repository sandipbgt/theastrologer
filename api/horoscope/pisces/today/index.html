    "horoscope": "You're deeply in touch with the spiritual, intangible side of life today. This includes your emotions, which are especially intense right now. It also includes that invisible thread that keeps you tuned in to other people at a level that sometimes seems psychic. That extrasensory awareness is keen right now. You might receive strong impressions and feelings that seem to come from nowhere. You're probably 'borrowing' them from someone else!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
