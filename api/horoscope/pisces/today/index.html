    "horoscope": "You're a from-the-heart kind of person. But today, be ruthless in applying common sense to everything you do -- even if it goes against that soft heart of yours.

Instead of feeling your way through a situation, judge it carefully and act accordingly. You can do this, gentle Pisces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
