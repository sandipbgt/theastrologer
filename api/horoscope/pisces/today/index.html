    "horoscope": "A sentimental mood grips you today. You might hug your child, spouse or pet extra tight, or smile over old memories. Steeping yourself in emotion feels wonderful now, even if it's bittersweet. After all, there's a certain romance to a melancholy mood. Watching old movies satisfies some soft, sweet part of your soul -- the same part that responds to poetry and stray puppies. Indulge this part of yourself today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
