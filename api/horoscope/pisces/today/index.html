    "horoscope": "It's a relief to get a little downtime today, because your energy is all over the place and you're distracted at best. Take a midday nap if you can, or do some yoga or meditation -- something to ground yourself and make your thoughts a little calmer. Spiritual activities are a wonderful idea today, because you're even more open to moments of awakening than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
