    "horoscope": "Any tendencies you have toward impulsiveness are heightened today. If you find yourself reacting too quickly to a situation, or even if you feel physically clumsy because you're moving too fast, take a few deep breaths and slow down. Try not to be impatient. Life is moving fast around you, but that doesn't mean you have to whiz along with it. Take your time and do things right.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
