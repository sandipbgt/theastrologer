    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if you need extra sleep today. You certainly need extra time to daydream. If you work at a demanding job, you may find it difficult to concentrate. Your mind just keeps wandering! There's no sense in fighting this, unless you absolutely have to get something concrete accomplished. But it would be better to shift meetings and other demands to another day, so you can let your thoughts roam.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
