    "horoscope": "For once you're comfortable living in the world of facts and figures. Things make even more sense to you than usual, because you're blending reason and intuition. With just a little effort, you can impress someone at work now. This brief period is also well spent connecting with friends, laughing as you share stories. Whatever you do, tune in with your whole being. This helps you understand people at an even deeper level than normal -- and that's saying something.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
