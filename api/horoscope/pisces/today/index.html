    "horoscope": "Listen to you yakking away. You appear to be venting hot air and selling vaporware, but what does it actually mean? Keep this up and you'll upset people by talking a lot and saying nothing. Give them a break, and give your voice a rest while you're at it. In fact, consider a day-long vow of silence. This isn't about being mean to you or even being charitable to your neighbors. It would be a nice, solid reality check, and a chance to let the dust settle and see what's really going on around you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
