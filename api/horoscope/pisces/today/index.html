    "horoscope": "Your escapist side is prominent today. You want nothing more than to lose yourself in a book, a movie, or a dream-filled nap. Dreams and fantasies are very creative, you know. The time you spend letting your thoughts wander can actually be quite productive. No doubt your boss will be happy to learn this! Let yourself fantasize about the future. You can manifest your dreams later, when you're feeling more focused.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
