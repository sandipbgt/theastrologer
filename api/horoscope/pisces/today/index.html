    "horoscope": "This could be an unstable month, as you teeter between selfless and selfish. Even if you don't want other people's noses in your business, there's still a chance they'll smell what you're cooking. Sometimes you'll be too shy for words, but other times you'll have the world's sharpest tongue. Nobody knows what you'll do next, not even you! Instead of hoping everyone has a short memory, start giving them a reason to forgive you. Because why would you want to be forgotten? For all you know, your finest hour starts today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
