    "horoscope": "When you feel shy, it's easy to make excuses -- you're not available, you can't chat right now. But enough, already. Face your fears. People are a lot nicer than you think. If someone extends an invite today, consider that they felt every bit as nervous about approaching you as you feel about accepting. Then accept. You'll both feel immediately more relaxed. Then you can move on to the hard part: deciding whether or not you make a good fit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
