    "horoscope": "On a normal day, your friends and coworkers describe you as helpful, supportive -- a saint, even. But today, you're working everyone's last nerve. At work and at home, you're tossing wrenches into everyone's plans as if you enjoy the resulting chaos. And nothing anyone says makes a difference. You may have to ride this one out solo. Everyone will still be there when you come to yourself, apologize for your behavior and start pitching in again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
