    "horoscope": "It's a great day to get together with a group of people and brainstorm big ideas. Whether you're doing a project at work or playing a game at a party, you're highly stimulated by the energy of the group dynamic. And you're more comfortable than a lot of people with abstract concepts. Delve into these areas now. Explore unique, innovative theories. Then do your best to explain them to others in concrete terms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
