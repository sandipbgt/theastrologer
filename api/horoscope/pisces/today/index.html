    "horoscope": "Now you're even more of a mystery to the people around you than usual. Of course, your feelings and perceptions have always been a bit too abstract for most folks to understand, but now your modesty mystifies them even more. How can you be modest when you're so incredibly compassionate and selflessly helpful to others? Don't worry if someone is jealous of you; it's just that you make your currently blessed state look so easy! If they only knew how hard you worked, they'd admire you even more.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
