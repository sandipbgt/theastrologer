    "horoscope": "You're drawn today to acts of selflessness, or even self-sacrifice. It's wonderfully fulfilling to help people or animals in need. But your energy may be a bit low now. Don't hold it against yourself if you simply can't do as much as you'd like to do to help someone. As long as your heart is in the right place, that's all that matters. Do what you can, and let that be enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
