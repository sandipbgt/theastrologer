    "horoscope": "Welcome to an emotionally saturated day. While some people are uncomfortable with this intensity of feeling, you actually enjoy it. After all, that's the level on which you live your life on a regular basis. And now, you're steeped in delicious feelings and memories. Even a sense of melancholy can be pleasurable now, since it's honest. Share your feelings with a friend. Use emotion as a bridge to connect with someone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
