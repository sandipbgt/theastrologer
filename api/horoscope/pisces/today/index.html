    "horoscope": "You're feeling everything extra deeply today. Your compassion is right at the front of your consciousness. Someone might tell you a story of their own struggles, and you'll feel their pain as if it's your own. It's a wonderful gift to have such sympathy for others. But you also have to work harder than others to establish solid personal boundaries. Find that balance today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
