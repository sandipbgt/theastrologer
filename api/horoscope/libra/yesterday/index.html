    "horoscope": "Today might feel like one uphill battle after another. Everything you think you want or need is just out of reach. Friends, coworkers and other people in your life with whom you're ordinarily close now seem to be on the opposite side of the fence. Is it an issue of perspective? If you keep on pushing against other people and their agendas, you could easily wear yourself out. Instead, stop and consider whether you're actually fighting for the right thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
