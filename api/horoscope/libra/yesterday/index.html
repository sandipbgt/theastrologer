Learn the lingo to become more than just another tourist. This is going to involve kindness and respect no matter how superior or inferior you might feel. Playing by the rules might not instantly make you a citizen or tribal member, or anything more than a friendly outsider, but that could be OK. You'll get inside somebody else's world view, and that has to be worth something.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
