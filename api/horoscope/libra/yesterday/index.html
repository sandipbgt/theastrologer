    "horoscope": "Today you're extra sensitive to other people's needs and feelings. This can be both a good thing and a challenging one. For example, if there's tension in one of your relationships, you're more likely now to take a passive role in deference to the other person. But sometimes, it's better to take a stand -- even if doing so is difficult. Try to judge each situation on its own merits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
