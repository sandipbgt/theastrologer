    "horoscope": "It's a good day to be introspective, especially if you sense that some area of your life is out of balance. If you've been having trouble with a particular relationship, look within yourself first, before pointing your finger at anyone else. How might you have contributed to this situation? Go ahead and be self-analytical. It's easy to analyze others, too. You have a better grasp than usual of the reasons behind their behavior.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
