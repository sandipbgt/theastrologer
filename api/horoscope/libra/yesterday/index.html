But on a day like today, when many people are in critical mindsets and it's tough to live up to their standards, you may have to live with the fact that you haven't satisfied someone's expectations. Keep your confidence up. You're still very good at what you do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
