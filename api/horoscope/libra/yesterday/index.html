Help someone who can use your generosity, but make sure to respect your own boundaries at the same time. It is possible to go overboard with compassion, and now not only is it possible, it's easy. Do what you can, but don't worry if you feel it still isn't enough. You've done a good deed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
