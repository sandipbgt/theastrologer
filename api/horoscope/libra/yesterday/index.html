    "horoscope": "Today is your day. You're in your element, and your energy is strong. You're tuned in to both people and ideas, so don't spend the day on your own if you don't have to. You'll be much happier in a gathering of like-minded people, whether in person, on the phone or in an online forum. Trading thoughts and perceptions is great fun. Plus, you can be the gentle voice of reason if tension develops.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
