    "horoscope": "Self-satisfaction is too easy amidst modern conveniences. Don't let easy money or user-friendly technology mislead you up a shallow grade of so-called deeper fulfillment. Rip out the ear buds, unplug from the grid and spend a day in rustic surroundings. You might resent the hard work and the sloppiness of nature, but you could also relish the chance for getting closer to your beautiful flawed self. Without all the enhancements and peripherals, you're wonderful just the way you are. But you knew that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
