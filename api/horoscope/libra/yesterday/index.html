    "horoscope": "It's a good day for creative work of any kind. Even if you aren't an artist, you have a strong sense of style, and you bring that sensibility to everything you do. Balance and symmetry are part of your aesthetic, so keep those ideals in mind today as you go about your business. If your checkbook or even a personal relationship is out of balance, you can make things stable once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
