    "horoscope": "Maintain the balance today instead of going one way or the other. This is going to require tact, diplomacy or talking out of both sides of your mouth, whatever you feel like calling it. And if they want a serious commitment from you, don't be shy about giving them a definite maybe instead. These evasive moves might end up costing a little extra, but aren't you worth it? Others can wait when you're still working on yourself. Take two days, three days, a month. You'll release your best version when it's ready and not one moment sooner.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
