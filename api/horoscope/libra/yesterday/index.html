    "horoscope": "The world is just as you like it today -- friendly, smooth, with an emphasis on beauty and creativity. Wear your favorite clothes today, and put a little extra time into your appearance before you go out to meet with friends. You'll look as special on the outside as you feel on the inside. It's a good day for social activity and any team project, whether at work or elsewhere.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
