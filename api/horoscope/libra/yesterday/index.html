    "horoscope": "Your mind is wide open today. This makes it easy to absorb information without judgment. You can consider ideas or approaches that you might reject at other times, simply because they're too challenging. Now, nothing is too much of a challenge. Everything you hear and learn is simply interesting! Take it all in, and take notes if you need to. Later, consider everything equally, and decide which parts work for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
