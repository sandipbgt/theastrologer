    "horoscope": "Suddenly you're casual, civilized and too cool for school. Perhaps you had the perfect workout at the gym or a moment of nirvana in yoga class. Were you visiting your guru or discovering the world's best cup of coffee? Maybe it's some or all of the above, or maybe it's just a perfect alignment in the body-mind-universe cycle. As long as you get that it can't be forever, you'll be able to go far today. If you're totally at ease with your inner world, start rebuilding your reputation. People like it when you're like this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
