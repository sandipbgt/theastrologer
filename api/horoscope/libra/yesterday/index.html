    "horoscope": "Today, you're at your mental best: peppy and outgoing, interested in every person and idea you encounter. You encourage other people to trade ideas. This makes for an interesting, stimulating day, but it also serves another purpose. Talking about your perceptions and comparing them with others' helps you make sense of things. You're building a logical, balanced view of reality, which helps you make better decisions and move forward with confidence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
