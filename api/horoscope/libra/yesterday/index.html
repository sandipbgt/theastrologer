    "horoscope": "A cheerful energy is brimming within and around you, brightening up your day. You're hustling and bustling, moving here and there, chatting up everyone you meet and getting things done. Socializing, networking and taking steps toward your goals, all at once -- that's you, Libra! In fact, fun should be your priority now. Yes, go ahead and make those connections. You have such a gift for lining up friends and allies who can help you out later. Today could lead to big things somewhere down the line.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
