    "horoscope": "Lots of folks are feeling independent today. The current cosmic influence brings out your leadership qualities, which actually puts pressure on you. Being decisive isn't always your strong point, since you like to consider all facets of a situation, including the needs of everyone involved, before determining your conclusion. Right now, hasty decisions feel downright reckless. But this is a good opportunity to build trust in yourself. Make your assessment and be firm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
