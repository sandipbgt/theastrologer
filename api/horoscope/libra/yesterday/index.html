Today, you'll strike the perfect balance with someone you really care for, and in so doing, you'll turn relating into an art form. Remember this useful skill for later, when the universe doesn't seem quite as indulgent as it does now. You'll be able to create these good feelings again when you really need them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
