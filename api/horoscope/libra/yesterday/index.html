Try to make a real decision other than the obvious resolve to escape at the first opportunity. Stick around for a while. Dare to assert yourself today. Take the risk of nudging reality onto a slightly different track. Once you volunteer for that responsibility, your life could instantly become richer than you ever imagined. There's nothing to compare this to if you haven't already experienced it. Just commit to making the effort, and then you'll see.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
