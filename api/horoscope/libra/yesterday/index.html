    "horoscope": "It's a great day to demonstrate your leadership qualities. You're a benevolent ruler, and other people are happy to follow your example. That's one of the benefits of being genuinely concerned with maintaining harmony with others! You really like people, so people really like you back. They treat you with warmth and respect. That makes it easier to get things accomplished, whether you're at work or at home.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
