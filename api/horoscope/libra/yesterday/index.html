    "horoscope": "It's a good day to correct any imbalances that have developed in some area of your life. If you've been straying from your diet or spending too much money, now it's a simple matter of recommitting to what you know is right. You have greater self-discipline than usual, which helps balance out your indulgent streak. Take an honest assessment of your work, finances and so on, and see what needs improvement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
