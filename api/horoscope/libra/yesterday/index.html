    "horoscope": "'Moderation in all things' could be one of your personal mottos. And today, it's an important one. Going overboard in any area isn't a good idea now. Playing by the rules, on the other hand, is good. Stay within the boundaries at work or in social interactions. Being reserved isn't unfriendly or antisocial; it's just prudent, for today. You'll get so much more accomplished if you're both cautious and diligent.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
