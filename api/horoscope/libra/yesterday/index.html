    "horoscope": "You're intellectually attuned to the world around you today. You'll approach everything you do with a sense of curiosity and a scientific eye, reasoning through the variables and testing out the possibilities until you arrive at a workable conclusion. This is an exciting and engaging process, even if you're working on something you would normally find tedious. Enjoy the sense of discovery, and the feeling of giving yourself a mental workout.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
