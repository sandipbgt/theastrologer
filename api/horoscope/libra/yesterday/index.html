That's okay with you, since you're open to possibility and ready for adventure. It's a good way to be, even if nothing happens. Enjoy this youthful flexibility while you have it. Soon, all your creative ideas will take form and become real.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
