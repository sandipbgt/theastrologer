    "horoscope": "Your focus now should be on trying to lead a well-kept life. You're a master at using charm instead of force. That skill comes into play now. You'll negotiate with friends and associates, and try to finish projects with an eye for detail and balance. This is a special talent of yours, so things should go well. Using this skill may turn your luck around. Can you think of ways to make this sort of behavior a habit? Doing so would benefit all your relationships and projects, and the rest of your life itself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
