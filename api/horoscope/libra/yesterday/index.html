The good news is, you're kindhearted enough to give people a lot of space and understanding, even if they behave in an unkind way. This is part of being a good leader: You lead by example, which inspires others to live up to the standard of behavior you set.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
