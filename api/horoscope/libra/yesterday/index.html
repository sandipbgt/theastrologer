If you notice that someone's feeling down, try not to take it upon yourself to distract them or fix their problems. Chances are good that their gloom will lift soon, like morning fog in the sunlight. In the meantime, focus on keeping your own mood elevated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
