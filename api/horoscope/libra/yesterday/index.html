    "horoscope": "What's that warm, sunny feeling wherever you turn? Don't worry, it's just fortune smiling on you today. You just have to pass on some of this glorious input, or you'll explode with the wonder of it all. Intelligence pours out whenever you open your mouth, and glamour drips from your very fingers. It's not like you really have a choice about these things, either. This is you in your element, and all is very cool -- even that warm, sunny feeling. No matter where you need to go next, you can find your way there from here.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
