    "horoscope": "You may not feel like buckling down and working, or tackling your to-do list. You're in the mood for good times and conversation with warm, lively people. Make it happen if you can, but if the daily grind is unavoidable, turn that into a party, too. Schedule business meetings for today, and enjoy getting off track with your colleagues. Or bring a friend along as you run errands, to make it more fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
