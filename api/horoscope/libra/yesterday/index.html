    "horoscope": "Think today about the next few weeks of your life. What would you like to do or accomplish? What resources will you need, and which people will you ask for help, input or support?

With specific goals in mind, you're much more likely to reach them, rather than getting caught up with distractions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
