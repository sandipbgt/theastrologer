    "horoscope": "Your closest connections with other people are highlighted today. You really want to get along with your spouse, best friend or business partner. It might even seem that agreement is the most important factor in your relationship -- even though it isn't. What about individuality and mutual respect? Do your best to find common ground, but try to embrace your differences, too. They're part of what makes you such a good team.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
