    "horoscope": "It's time to start living a full life. Savor everything that happens to you. Give it your all today. Get into the habit of working and playing like you mean it. Because, if you don't already, you certainly should. Attract nothing but good attention, and that will feed directly into how you see yourself. But this isn't about delusion or painting on a happy but false face that you don't actually feel inside. As long as you're being real, reality itself should treat you kindly. And you couldn't ask for better treatment than that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
