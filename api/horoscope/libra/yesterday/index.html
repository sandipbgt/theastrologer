You'd be far better off cooperating on someone else's terms, in no small part because doing so makes it more likely that they'll return the favor sometime down the line. So access your natural ability to play well with others and use it now, to everyone's advantage.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
