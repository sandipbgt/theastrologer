    "horoscope": "Innovative thinking is the name of the game today. You're feeling independent, but that doesn't mean you can't work well with others. It's a great day to form a well-functioning creative team, or to network with people who may become important allies in the future. Brainstorming also goes surprisingly well now. It's easier to access your own brilliance. And when you're at your intellectual best, you're a good example for others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
