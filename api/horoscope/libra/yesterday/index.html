    "horoscope": "Like a lot of people, you're feeling emotionally sensitive today. Someone's behavior or comment might hurt your feelings. The good news is, you aren't the type to react without thinking. You'd rather keep the peace than retaliate when you feel stung. You're able to give people the benefit of the doubt. Of course you should stand up for yourself when necessary, but it's a real gift to let things roll off your back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
