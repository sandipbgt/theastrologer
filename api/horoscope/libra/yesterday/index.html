    "horoscope": "You may be more decisive today than usual, which is a good thing. Your energy is certainly focused. But there's a difference between 'decisive' and 'impulsive.' Try to err on the side of the former! Even if you feel backed into a corner in some situation, take your time to be sure you're making the right choice. Don't let anyone push you into making the wrong move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
