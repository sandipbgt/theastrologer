    "horoscope": "Plenty of folks are feeling ambitious today. You may be, as well. Your leadership skills are readily accessible, though they may not be very overt. Instead of asserting your authority over other people, you tend to rule more by finesse. But don't be afraid to put your foot down about something if you need to. Sometimes, being a strong leader means taking a strong stance -- or even an unpopular one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
