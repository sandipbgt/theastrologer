Today, you're nowhere near making a decision, because there are just too many opinions to consider. But this is the best part! Talk with other people and brainstorm creative ideas with them. Have fun with this. You'll arrive at a decision soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
