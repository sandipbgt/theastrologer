    "horoscope": "You crave closeness today with someone who knows you well, such as your spouse, partner or best friend. But this person knows both your strengths and your weaknesses, and loves you just the same. If you need to have a heart-to-heart talk, this is a good day for it. Just be honest about your own feelings and motivations, and reach out with love. Intimacy will deepen as a result.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
