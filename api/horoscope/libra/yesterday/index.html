    "horoscope": "Today, express your needs and desires to someone, even if it feels awkward and uncomfortable. Sometimes it's good to push yourself outside your comfort zone. If you've had your eye on someone special, let them know how you feel. If you're in a romantic relationship, open up to your partner and make yourself vulnerable. You'll be glad you did, even if, in the moment, you feel nervous about what might go wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
