    "horoscope": "Today, the boundary that normally separates fantasy from reality is unusually thin. You might wake up from a dream and spend a few moments fully convinced it really happened. It's also easy to imagine all kinds of impossible things -- monsters under the bed, anyone? It's important to keep a sense of perspective! On the other hand, why not tap into this richly imaginative vibe? You can use it to enrich your creative work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
