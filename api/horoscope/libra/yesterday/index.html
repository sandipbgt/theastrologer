    "horoscope": "There's no sense in wringing your hands over things you can't affect. There's plenty that you can do to make the world a better place, and you're pretty good about doing it. You should swallow your worries for today. Put your concerns behind you. Be more agreeable to others and they'll be more agreeable with you. Destiny would be kinder to you if you meet it with open arms. Embrace change.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
