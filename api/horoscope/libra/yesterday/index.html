    "horoscope": "You're quite sensitive today, especially in tense situations or confrontations. You might realize how thin-skinned you're feeling when someone's comment pushes a button you didn't even realize was a tender spot. When you're in a mood like this, it's a good idea to be gentle with yourself, and avoid spending time with abrasive types who might rub you the wrong way without even realizing what they're doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
