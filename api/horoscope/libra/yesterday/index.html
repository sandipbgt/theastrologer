    "horoscope": "You feel deeply attached today to the people you love, and you need to connect with them. Time spent with a lover could be very intense. Even your bond with your best friend feels complex and compelling. Just don't be surprised if the other person is behaving strangely. Possessive, jealous or controlling behavior is common right now. It's up to you to keep yourself emotionally balanced and on equal ground with others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
