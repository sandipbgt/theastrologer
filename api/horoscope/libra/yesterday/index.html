And you're sure to impress them with your honest approach to communication that somehow completely sidesteps cynicism. Art speaks to you now, as does anyone creating that art. You might end up purchasing a special piece that you've been eyeballing, but probably you''ll simply enjoy as many fruits of creativity as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
