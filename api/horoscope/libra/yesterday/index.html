If you're able to bring people together, it will be in the name of hard work. If you're able to create beauty, it will come with some sort of restriction. That's just the way life is right now. But don't worry. Things will brighten up soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
