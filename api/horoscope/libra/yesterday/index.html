    "horoscope": "Different worlds are coming together, and you're front and center. This could easily result in major chaos, but instead, all goes smoothly. Why? Because you're calmly in charge, using your smarts and your keen eye to coordinate everything like a master conductor. Today you're everyone's friend, and you know just what needs to happen and when. Most amazingly of all, you make it look effortless as you move from one group to the next, making small talk while conducting important business. Working with the current energy flow is so much easier than struggling against it, isn't it?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
