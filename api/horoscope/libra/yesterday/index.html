But this is far less likely a reflection of reality than of your current state of emotional insecurity. For whatever reason, you're feeling a bit vulnerable in your relationships or your work, and you're turning that feeling against the people in your life. Try not to take this too far -- it's just a mood, and it'll pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
