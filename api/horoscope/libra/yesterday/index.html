    "horoscope": "Ordinarily, you're happy to stay wrapped up in your warm, cozy little reality, but today is all about emerging from that pleasant cocoon into the bright, bold world. You're infused with adventurous energy, and you know you can make anything happen if you just get the ball rolling. It's important to you to have harmony in your relationships, so be sure to use a reassuring smile and your best manners. After all, people might not be expecting anything like you. They're more likely to get behind your efforts if they sense that you're a good bet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
