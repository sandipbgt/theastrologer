Be affectionate if you want affection. Other people here already believe in your basic decency, and by now they've probably forgiven or forgotten most of your bigger mistakes. In some ways, you're a blank slate. Use today and demonstrate that you deserve their trust. See what a little good cheer, cooperation and honesty can do for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
