Not everything quite adds up, but you sense that with just a few additional facts or more time spent weighing your options, your course will be clear. This is more a day for gaining perspective than for making decisions. The time for action will come soon enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
