    "horoscope": "A situation may arise today that helps you develop greater self-awareness. This could be the type of situation that, given the choice, you wouldn't choose to experience. But it's almost sure to be the type that, looking back, you'll feel grateful to have gone through. Some of life's best moments are also the most intense, and today's influence lends itself to that dynamic. Be brave, and learn as much as you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
