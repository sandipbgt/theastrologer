    "horoscope": "You're in no mood to work today. You just want to enjoy yourself and your friends. You may have an incredible sweet tooth, too, and an overwhelming urge to treat yourself to something new, but practice some self-discipline. Don't allow yourself to slack off today. It's time to apply yourself to the task at hand. If you focus, you'll find you're able to put in hours of solid effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
