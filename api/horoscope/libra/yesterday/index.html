    "horoscope": "You're in a lazy mood, aren't you? You might spout opinions without supporting them, so if you have to support your position at work or in class, you might be in a bit of trouble. Well --this mood will pass soon. In the meantime, do things to support a feeling of close, warm security: Take an afternoon nap, read a good book, or lift weights at the gym to increase your sense of your own strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
