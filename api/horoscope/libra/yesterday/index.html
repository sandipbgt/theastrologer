    "horoscope": "Today is about toeing the line, paying thorough attention to detail, and living up to expectations. Fortunately, this should be a snap for you. You want and intend to fulfill your responsibilities, and you genuinely care about pleasing others. This helps you stay on task, even when you'd rather set your duties aside and relax a little. Besides, it's just for a day or two. Then life should loosen up again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
