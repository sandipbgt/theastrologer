It might be as simple and transitory as the stylish outfit you wear to work, or it could be an actual object, poem or painting wrought with your own hands and from your own imagination. Create with a warm and generous heart, and you'll know you're accessing the best part of yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
