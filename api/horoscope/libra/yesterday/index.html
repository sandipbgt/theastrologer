Even old, stale ideas seem fresh, simply because your perspective is renewed. This is the kind of day when teachers become students again, and students are suddenly able to teach their insights to others. Enjoy the sense of integration in your broadest philosophies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
