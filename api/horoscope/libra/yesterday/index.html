    "horoscope": "Life sure is sweet, and that has you laughing good-naturedly. You can share the joke with the world, if you like, but you certainly don't have to. However, part of the charm of this moment lies in connecting with other people. Communication can take you far now, because you have a way of lifting others' spirits as you let them in. The possibilities are truly limitless, as long as you're tuned in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
