    "horoscope": "It's time for tension and arguments to dissolve. Do your part by cooperating instead of challenging anyone. Their point of view is as valid as yours, after all. Calm any doubts with a smile. Once everyone's ruffled feathers are smooth once again, you can heave a sigh of relief. You deserve a day off! No one should have to deal with opposing forces on a regular basis. Good thing you're such a natural at diplomacy and bringing people together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
