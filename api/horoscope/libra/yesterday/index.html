    "horoscope": "They can't get enough of you. Maybe this flatters you. Maybe you've already had way too much of them and just want to be alone. You'll blow hot and cold today. So what? You never set out to lead anybody on. You just happen to like people, and it was a charming moment. Good friends will understand your mood. People on your team will back off and wait for you to come up with some results. Soon this whole prickly incident will be over and you'll go back to making appearances and signing autographs. Hey, nobody said being a star was easy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
