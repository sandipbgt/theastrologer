Good thing you're such a pro at staying positive, even when the picture looks grim. Draw on this energy during this brief period, because you're feeling a little off, which makes it easy to get frustrated. But there's nothing wrong with using placeholders. You'll come back and finish the job soon, as soon as you're feeling more clear-headed and on top of things. Go ahead and fill in the blanks of a working document.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
