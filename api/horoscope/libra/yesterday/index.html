While it's wonderful to be compassionate, right now you're more vulnerable than usual to people who would take advantage of your kindness. Try not to be gullible. Listen to others' troubles, but take them with a grain of salt. And remember that you have your own life to manage. You can't solve everyone else's problems as well as your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
