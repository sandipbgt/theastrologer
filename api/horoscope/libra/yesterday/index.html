    "horoscope": "Instead of being your usual, social-butterfly self, why not stay close to home today? Spending time with close friends and family soothes your soul. And that's important now, when you're feeling a little bit anxious or vulnerable. Any worries or grouchiness will pass soon, and may never solidify into anything serious. But it just feels nice now to be around people you know and love. It's the easiest way to be yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
