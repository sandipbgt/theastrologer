    "horoscope": "Look deeply into secrets, feelings and hidden places today. Go through an old closet or box of letters, or reread your journal from your youth. Delving into memories and emotions is incredibly revealing now. It could even spur some creative writing or another emotionally expressive project. Though you normally prefer to keep things sweet and harmonious, don't shy away from your own dark corners today. Self-awareness helps you grow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
