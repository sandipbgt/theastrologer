You could start an artists' colony with all your admirers, or at least host a creativity salon today. This is your chance to preside over a meeting of talented minds. You have a great deal to add to the group, and they'll feed off your ideas. There's no limit to what you can imagine once you start.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
