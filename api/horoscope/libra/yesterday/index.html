Probably more compulsive than anything else. In fact, there's something elegant to your eloquence. And there's no question that you mean well by sharing all this information. But it's a two-way process here, and maybe others have something you need, too. Try listening occasionally today. Don't you want anything in exchange for all that you're giving? You deserve to let them return the favor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
