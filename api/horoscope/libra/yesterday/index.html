If you make the effort to talk them out, you can make a lot of progress toward rebuilding that strong connection. Just remember that balance is key. Every relationship, whether romantic, professional or simply kindred spirits, should be about give and take on both sides. If you're giving too much or too little, that needs to be corrected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
