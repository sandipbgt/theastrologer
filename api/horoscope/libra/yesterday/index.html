    "horoscope": "Life gets slow-paced and enjoyable today. If you have a materialistic streak, don't be surprised if it swells now. You're feeling romantic and creative, which heightens your appreciation for style and beauty. You're drawn to color, texture, flavor and other sensual pleasures. And money may seem utterly unimportant! This is the kind of day when you might splurge on something you know you don't need and can't afford.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
