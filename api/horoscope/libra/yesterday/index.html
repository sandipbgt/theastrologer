    "horoscope": "Today, focus on establishing balance in any area of your life that may have gotten out of hand. This might mean taking a look at your spending, and setting up a budget for yourself to rein it in. Or perhaps you want to set up a new diet or exercise regimen, or clean out your desk or closet. Any of these activities brings you a great deal of satisfaction now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
