    "horoscope": "Things have to follow a certain order today, and you may feel impatient with the wait. If you lost some work you did on a project, do it over rather than moving on without it. It'll take some time and effort, but it's almost certainly worth it. Today is about putting focused effort into something important. Maybe you'll see some improvement in things if you really give it your all. You can relax and have fun again in a few days, but for now, resign yourself to doing a thorough job.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
