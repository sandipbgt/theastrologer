    "horoscope": "You know how to be gracious but tenacious at the same time, and that's just the balance you should strike today. You have a definite plan of action, which is a good thing -- there's less chance of being indecisive when you've already determined your goals and how to reach them. Just be sure to mind your manners as you push gently forward. This warning probably isn't necessary, since you're almost always charming and polite, but still, it bears stating.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
