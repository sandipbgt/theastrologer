Don't waste any more of your precious time brooding over a lost opportunity. There could be even better ones today, and they'll all go by just as fast if you're not paying attention. Your forward progress through life is often a series of random events. Even if you can't plan ahead, at least you can reset your frame of mind to turn them into happy accidents. Adjust your mood and everything's different .(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
