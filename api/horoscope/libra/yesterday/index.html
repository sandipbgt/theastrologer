    "horoscope": "Your energy is smooth. Your focus is on bringing people together rather than creating unnecessary rifts or strife. You'll be a benign force today, and your hands and karma are clean. But you may be wondering, now that you don't have an edge, can you get others' attention? Never fear. The old saying about drawing more flies with honey applies here. People will pay attention to you precisely because you're openhearted and welcoming. You don't need to throw your weight around to get support. Set your ego aside and work with other people to get something accomplished.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
