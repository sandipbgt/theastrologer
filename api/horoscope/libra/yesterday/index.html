Instead, it seems necessary, because you're entrenched in full-on self-protection mode as you face down a stressful, confusing situation. The thing is, no one is threatening anything of yours that truly matters. Try to recognize that fact, as soon as you can. That way, you'll be able to relax, face this issue down and resolve it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
