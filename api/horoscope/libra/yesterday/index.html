    "horoscope": "Promoting yourself might look like a vanity move. Following your passion might seem excessive when everyone else is just sitting there frozen. As far as they're concerned, you're going way over the top just to make a few simple improvements. Why should you care what they think? Because they could be right about using too much to do too little. Would it really cramp your style to save some of this for later? Take it slowly today, just to see how that feels. Maybe your critics won't seem so repressed after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
