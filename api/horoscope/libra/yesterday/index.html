    "horoscope": "Today might be your favorite kind of day -- the kind when friendly conversations and spirited debates abound. You're connecting with people and using your mind to solve interesting intellectual puzzles. What could be more fun? Connecting with others is key now, so don't spend the day alone. If you have to work on your own, make it a community effort by keeping in touch with your colleagues via email or phone calls.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
