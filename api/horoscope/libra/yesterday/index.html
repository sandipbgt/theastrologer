It's easy to demonstrate your depth of honesty, simply by being thorough in everything you do. Treat even minor tasks as worthy of careful attention and consideration. Even if you're simply puttering around at home or doing mundane tasks at work, enjoy the sense of peace and accomplishment that comes from doing a job well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
