Or spend time with friends, and linger over food, drinks and laughter. The most important thing now is not to rush things. To be in a hurry would be such a waste of this contented, amiable vibe! Even if you're working, be thorough. It's not a race. (c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
