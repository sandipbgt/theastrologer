    "horoscope": "Maybe you're all grumpy and lonely, and maybe you don't even know why. Could it be that too much baggage is impairing your communication skills? It's not like you can see over the top of what you're carrying to read people's lips. And if they can't get an accurate hit on your expression or body language, where does that leave the conversation? Of course, what's useless to you might not be useless to everyone. Disperse some of these riches today. Make some friends through your generosity, and clear your own way for continued growth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
