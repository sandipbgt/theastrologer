You make sure everyone's agenda is respected -- this alone is sure to improve relations. Today, you'll show everyone what you're capable of, and then can use their support to get work done. You've got lots of support coming your way -- be sure to take advantage of it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
