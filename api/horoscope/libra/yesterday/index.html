    "horoscope": "Whew -- today's energy could give rise to some intense conversations! Even with coworkers or new acquaintances, it's hard to stay at that surface level in conversation. Somehow, things keep getting steered toward deeper subjects, such as fear and anxiety, love and desire, and so on. You may wonder whether this is strictly appropriate. But it's easier just to go with the flow of conversation than to stay in 'safe' realms!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
