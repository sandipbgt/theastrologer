Even if your coworker or a friend finds a way to cause trouble, you're able to use kindhearted diplomacy to step in and save the day. Everyone's listening and looking up to you now, because you're so friendly and genuine. People want to hang out near you and bask in your glow. Be their good example in how to make every new day extra special.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
