Doesn't everyone deserve to have their needs met? Yes -- and that includes you. Today, you may have to dig deep and find your backbone. It's in there somewhere, just waiting for you to notice it. Know that it's worth taking a stand to avoid feeling used or ignored later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
