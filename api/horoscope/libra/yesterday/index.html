    "horoscope": "Today you might crave harmony in your relationships above all else. In this kind of mood, it's hard to put your personal needs ahead of your desire for team unity. Thus, you might let someone else take the lead on a project or in a decision that affects you directly. If it's something important, set boundaries or take a stand as needed. Harmony is valuable, but you have to stand up for yourself, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
