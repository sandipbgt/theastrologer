    "horoscope": "You're all about playing a fair game. Maybe you don't think chaos is ugly, but you're good at tying all those loose ends into artful knots. Even if you don't plan this stuff, it happens anyway. You're probably controlling it on some level, and of course word gets around. People can smell what you're cooking from miles away, so for today, blend old ingredients into something new. Then they'll really be lining up outside your door! Whatever schemes you have in the oven, make it so that everybody gets a piece of the pie this time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
