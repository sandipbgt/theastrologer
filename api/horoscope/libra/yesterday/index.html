    "horoscope": "You're feeling solitary, and a day on your private island sounds like heaven. You might fantasize about burying yourself on the couch under a mountain of pillows, with a stack of DVDs and the remote control as your only companion -- but the world is waiting. And you can't just run away every time life gets a little bit challenging. So come ashore and face your troubles. They're smaller and more manageable than you think.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
