    "horoscope": "You may need extra sleep today, because your usual high energy is likely to be low. Take a nap, if you can, or get to bed early tonight. That has the added benefit of more time in dreamland -- that wonderfully imaginative place that your mind visits so easily under the current influence. You're a creative person by nature, and now especially. Letting your thoughts wander, whether you're awake or asleep, enhances your work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
