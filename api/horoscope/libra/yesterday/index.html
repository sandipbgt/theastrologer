    "horoscope": "A sentimental, self-indulgent mood settles in. You may be tempted to worship at the altar of your kitchen -- cakes, cookies and ice cream, oh, my! And a certain amount of indulgence is certainly in order on a quiet afternoon at home. Just make sure you aren't eating extra calories to fill an emotional void. If there are feelings in your heart that need addressing,them in your journal or with a friend.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
