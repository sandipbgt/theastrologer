    "horoscope": "You're concerned today with status and recognition. While there's nothing wrong with that in itself, you may end up behaving in ways you aren't proud of later. Focus on what's really important. If you're going for a new job or a promotion, of course, it's smart to make a good impression. But if you simply want recognition for your hard work, trust it will come your way when the time is right.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
