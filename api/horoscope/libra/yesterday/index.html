    "horoscope": "You're in an extra cooperative mood today. In fact, you're willing to bend over backward to get along with someone, if that's what it takes. It's a really nice quality, this urge to stay closely united with others. Just make sure you can still take a stand when you need to. Sometimes you have to be firm, even when you know that doing so is going to upset someone close to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
