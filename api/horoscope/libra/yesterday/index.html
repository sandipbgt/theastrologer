    "horoscope": "Your usually high spirits may dip a bit today. If so, don't take the vague sense of discontentment too seriously. Keep your energy up by throwing yourself into helping others. Service to a person, pet or cause feels wonderful. Just be sure to choose your cause carefully. Trying to help those who refuse to help themselves won't ultimately be very productive. And you have much better places to put your energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
