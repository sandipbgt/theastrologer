    "horoscope": "Get-togethers with friends are especially fun today, because you're in the mood for company. You may be tempted to keep refilling your glass or plate, but try to restrain yourself, or you could pay for it tomorrow with a headache or stomachache. Also, don't be afraid to speak your mind in conversations. Getting along is important to you, but being straightforward doesn't have to create tension. Your friends will respect your honesty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
