Think of this brief period as a dinner party filled with VIPs, but no one's wearing a name tag. You could meet someone who will later become your partner in some grand endeavor -- someone who will be instrumental in helping you achieve a treasured goal. Treat them well!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
