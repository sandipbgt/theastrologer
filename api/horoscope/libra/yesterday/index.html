    "horoscope": "People may not realize this about you, since you're such a cooperative person, but you're a natural leader. Today, this part of your personality is activated. While someone else might respond to the current energy by trying to dominate others, you're more likely to take charge in a teamwork-oriented way. If you're in charge of a group project, it's a savvy move to let others have as much autonomy as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
