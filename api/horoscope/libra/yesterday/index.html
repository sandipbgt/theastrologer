Your own energy is humming like a well-tuned engine, fueling anything and everything you want to accomplish today. Better yet, you're a natural now at drawing like-minded, dynamic people to your side. They make up just one part of your wide pool of resources. As you work to bring everything into balance, don't forget how lucky you are. And remember that life isn't always this much fun, so enjoy yourself!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
