    "horoscope": "It's a good day for hard work. Your social nature may not gravitate toward this -- it's more fun to gather with friends or be creative. And yet, you're levelheaded enough to appreciate balance in all things. If your Inbox is full of unanswered emails, work through them systematically now. The same goes for a pile of papers, or spending habits gone amok. It's deeply satisfying now to impose order on chaos.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
