Whether that goal is to win a board game or to improve some important structure that affects all your lives, it's satisfying to work side by side with other people. And you, dear, bring something special to the table: the ability to negotiate a truce if tension starts to develop.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
