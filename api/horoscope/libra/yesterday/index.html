    "horoscope": "Whatever may be on your agenda for today, you're in the mood to have fun while you're doing it. At work, you make time to laugh and chat with your friends. At home, you cuddle with your child, spouse or beloved pet. You're generous and affectionate, which means new friends could come into your life today. Connect with old ones, too, by calling someone on the phone or sending them a warm email.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
