    "horoscope": "Time to put on your thinking cap. You're newly confident to the point of brashness, and you're primed and ready to make something truly exciting happen. Be forewarned -- an older dynamic may not work. In fact, it's better to try something completely new and inspired. Today is all about fresh energy and bold approaches. This is a good time to reassess your relationships and figure out who's still a true companion. That way you'll have help in getting this thing off the ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
