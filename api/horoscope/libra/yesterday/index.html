Best of all, your charisma is the warm kind that invites other people in rather than holding them at arm's length. After all, you would prefer affection to awe just about any day! Enjoy the energized, connected feeling of togetherness that's available now as you spend time with your favorite people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
