This shouldn't be tough, since you're goal-oriented by nature. Tap into that take-charge energy that drives you. Use it to make solid progress on a particular endeavor. You might wish you could rely on teamwork, but you'll probably have to work solo.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
