    "horoscope": "You're a leader at heart -- a gentle leader, perhaps, but a leader all the same. That urge to take charge is highlighted today. The only problem is, it's highlighted within a lot of other people, too! Do your best to share responsibilities and delegate tasks when appropriate. That way, everyone can feel as if they're an important part of things. Besides, it's easier to work together when duties are clearly defined!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
