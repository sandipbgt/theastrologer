    "horoscope": "It's easy to get confused today. Reality and fantasy merge into one. You might wake up from a dream and have a hard time determining whether it really happened! This sense of unreality can be fun, but it can also be disorienting. And if self-doubt enters the picture, then disillusionment could follow. Hopes and dreams sometimes turn out to be unrealistic. But it's still important to keep favored goals in mind!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
