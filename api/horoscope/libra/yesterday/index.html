    "horoscope": "Tension may be inevitable today. When you get people together who are feeling high-spirited, it's just a matter of time before they start butting heads! When this happens, you might go into negotiator mode, instinctively trying to keep everyone calm and happy. But if you look a little more closely, you'll probably realize people are in excellent moods. A spirited debate is fun! You might be the only one who's feeling anxious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
