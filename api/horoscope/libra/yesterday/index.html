    "horoscope": "Your vision is extraordinary today. You're able to imagine the best possible future for the planet, or at least the people in your home or community. That's the beauty of those rose-colored glasses you wear. They help you give everyone an ideal to live up to! And looking on the bright side of life helps compensate for all the negative people in the world. So envision the future as a pleasant, uplifting place to be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
