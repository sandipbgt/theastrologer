    "horoscope": "You're a revolutionary, or at least a true romantic. You know what you want, and boy, do you want it bad. But you're going to hit obstacles in the form of other responsibilities, other people's agendas, and maybe even their flat-out refusals. Listen to them instead of trying to barrel on ahead. Enthusiasm is great, but not if it's fueled by misdirected aims or unconscious desires, and that's a distinct possibility now. Time to check yourself before you wreck yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
