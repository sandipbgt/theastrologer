    "horoscope": "Maybe you'll look, but you don't feel like you have to touch, at least not yet. You're breezy and hands-off. You're happy to sing that airy, distant melody from somewhere outside the spotlight, in the wings, or even from a different building. You're not about to get in anybody's face, but you wouldn't have a problem if they came looking for you. It's intentional yet effortless, a sincere belief in pacifism mixed with the ease of not wanting to bother. If you're this cool for one more day, you're sure to impress someone important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
