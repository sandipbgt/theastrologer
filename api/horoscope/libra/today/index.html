If you're worried about overstepping your bounds, don't. That might happen, but it won't be the worst thing in the world. It would be worse to feel something strongly but hang back out of fear. Sometimes, refined behavior isn't the most important thing. A bit of boldness is in order!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
