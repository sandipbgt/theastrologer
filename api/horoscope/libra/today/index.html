    "horoscope": "This is one of those days when you're better off not inspecting your feelings too deeply. Just feel them, and let them pass through you at their own pace. This takes a lot of compassion toward yourself. But you can handle that. Simply take the warmth and goodwill you always display toward others and turn it inward. Take it easy and be kind to everyone -- yourself, first and foremost.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
