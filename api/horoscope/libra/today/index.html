    "horoscope": "Do your best to stay focused today. Procrastination serves no one, and least of all you. And it certainly doesn't make your responsibilities disappear! Applying yourself to your duties might be the last thing you want to do, but apply yourself anyway. Once you plow through that to-do list, you'll be glad you were so diligent. And the sooner you finish your work, the sooner you can realize those relaxation fantasies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
