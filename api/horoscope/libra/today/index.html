    "horoscope": "You're an artist by nature. Today, do your best to become a craftsman as well. It's important to put time and care into everything you do now, whether you're at work or pursuing a project of your own. Instead of jumping into something on faith or inspiration, take the time to make a detailed plan. Then put it in motion, with an emphasis on efficient progress. Now you're the total package, lovely Libra.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
