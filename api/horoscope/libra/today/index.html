    "horoscope": "If someone seems insensitive today, they're probably just trying to take care of things. And while you'd prefer your business transactions to come with a healthy helping of social niceties, today, that just isn't in the stars. People are feeling hurried and harried, so they're skimping on the social frills you consider essential to a good life. But don't worry,. Life will lighten up again very soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
