    "horoscope": "Your organizational skills are heightened today, so use them. It's a good time to plan a project, because you're both creative and realistic. You'll neither aim too high nor restrict yourself too much. Being aware of what's feasible keeps you grounded, and that's a good thing. Knowing your limitations allows you to be innovative within those confines. That's the whole point of boundaries -- and that's where creativity really blooms!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
