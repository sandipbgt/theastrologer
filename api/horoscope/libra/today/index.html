    "horoscope": "Today should be sweet. Somehow the day flies by and the tasks you have to accomplish don't seem so terrible. Worker bees fall in love with their work, because, really -- how bad is it flying from flower to flower and making honey? If you take this attitude, your workday will be over before you know it. And being a social animal, you'll enjoy the genuine affection among members of your hive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
