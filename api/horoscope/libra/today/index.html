But this person knows both your strengths and your weaknesses, and loves you just the same. If you need to have a heart-to-heart talk, this is a good day for it. Just be honest about your own feelings and motivations, and reach out with love. Intimacy will deepen as a result.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
