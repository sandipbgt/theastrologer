Seek logic and efficiency in anything you do today. Streamline your routine as you run errands or work through your task list. It's a great time to impress your boss or a client, because your attention to detail is rarely more precise than it is today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
