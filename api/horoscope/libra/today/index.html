And if you haven't spent enough time on work or organization, do so today. Get things in order at home or at the office. Throw out anything that isn't useful, including possessions, habits and systems. Clear the decks for a more organized life!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
