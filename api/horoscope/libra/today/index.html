    "horoscope": "You're easygoing today, relishing the breeze in your face, trailing your fingers in theas you glide through life. So why the sudden athletic impulses? What's up with the power bursts and grandstand plays? This is what happens when something really hooks you in. Your true self will break the polished surface in all its passion and energy. You'll throw yourself at the object of your desire without looking to see if it's raising its arms to catch you. Expect to make some compromises today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
