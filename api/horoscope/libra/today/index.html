    "horoscope": "Put your personal touch on a project today. You have a fine sense of balance, not to mention a distinct aesthetic taste. Even the most mundane task can benefit from your artistic eye. If you make dinner for your family, arrange the food artfully on the plates. If you're giving a presentation at work, put extra time into your graphics or the language you use to make your pitch. This is your forte,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
