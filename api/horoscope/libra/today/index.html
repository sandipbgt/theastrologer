    "horoscope": "You're highly impressionable today. Each person you talk to is able to sway your point of view, simply by presenting theirs. Well, it's not your fault that you relate to so many different perspectives! But it might be best to avoid decisive action today. Wait until your own position is clearer. There's no reason you should have to make up your mind if you aren't ready yet. Keep clarifying,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
