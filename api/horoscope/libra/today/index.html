    "horoscope": "Today it seems even more important than usual to spend time with loved ones. You may be feeling quite emotionally sensitive, and being close to the people you trust is a real comfort. Of course, if there's tension or discord at home, that could add to the sense of unease. In that case, rely on your natural skills as a negotiator to get people talking. You can work through rough patches gracefully.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
