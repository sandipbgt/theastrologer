    "horoscope": "You're always softhearted, but today it's as if you're made out of gooey caramel. You're soft, sweet and easily dented! The best way to use the current energy might be connecting with your loved ones or getting lost in a silly movie. Otherwise, you might overreact to someone's offhand comment and get your feelings hurt -- but bottle up your unhappiness instead of talking it out. Be tactful but direct, gentle.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
