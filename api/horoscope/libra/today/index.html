    "horoscope": "It's a great day to enjoy yourself in your favorite way. You're feeling highly creative, so take in some artwork or music, or make your own. Or spend time with friends, and linger over food, drinks and laughter. The most important thing now is not to rush things. To be in a hurry would be such a waste of this contented, amiable vibe! Even if you're working, be thorough. It's not a race. (c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
