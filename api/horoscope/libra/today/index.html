    "horoscope": "You've always been a romantic at heart, but today the depth of your feelings may surprise you. Desire takes center stage, whether you're single or coupled. Both friendships and intimate relationships can be complicated by jealous or possessive behavior. If you start feeling upset or needy, take a deep breath. Inspect the hidden emotions that lie beneath. Perhaps you're worried or feeling vulnerable. The same might be true of your friend or mate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
