    "horoscope": "Are you an agent of change or a wimpy excuse-maker? Will you follow the playbook chapter-and-verse or make it up as you go? Are you being too vain? Too humble?

Maybe everything's fine and you can just stay on course. Maybe you'll need to do a total about face and march off in the other direction. It's good to be prepared for anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
