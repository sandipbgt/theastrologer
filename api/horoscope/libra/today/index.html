    "horoscope": "Try not to feel discouraged today if life seems a little harsher or more difficult than you anticipated. Things are probably no different from usual. You're just in a slightly raw emotional space. But your creativity is also highly charged today. It's a great day to escape into your own imagination. Reading, listening to music and daydreaming can all bring up wondrous images and ideas. Tune in to them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
