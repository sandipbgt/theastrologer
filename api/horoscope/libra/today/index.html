When you're in the grip of divine inspiration, everything's cool and anything goes, whether that means passionate one-on-one time or standing alone on a mountain somewhere. Of course, your inner condition will be obvious to the outer world. Who could miss something like this? And if others come along to bask in your bright light today, will you complain? What a concept! Just savor whatever happens to you, and you could see some long-term life improvements start happening in the short term.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
