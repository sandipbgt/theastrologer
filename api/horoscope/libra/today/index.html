Maybe it's just that your personal energy is meshing incredibly well with that of the world around you. You're even more fair-minded and friendly than ever, making this a wonderful time to connect with potential allies. A generous, 'pay it forward' attitude will help you kick off a month of fairness on your own terms, (c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
