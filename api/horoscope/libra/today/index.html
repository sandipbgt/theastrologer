    "horoscope": "Today it's hard to keep your mind on the task at hand. Emotions crowd in when you're trying to concentrate, or your attention strays to a strange dream you had last night or the date you're looking forward to. Your idealistic streak broadens, which could have you entertaining visions of your ideal relationship or career. This isn't such a bad thing: Envisioning your best life could help you create it in reality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
