    "horoscope": "Like many people today, you're in the mood to relax and enjoy your friends and loved ones. You might avoid work at all costs, no matter how pressing your responsibilities might be. Who wants to spend the day in drudgery, when you're in such a loving mood? But it's all about balance,. A little work, a little play, a little alone time. That will get you through the day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
