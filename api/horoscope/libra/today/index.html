Since you're a natural negotiator, you can help keep things running smoothly, even if your team is made up of people with very different values or ideas. Part of your strength lies in the fact that you encourage this diversity. You're open to everyone's input, and you're willing to try out every idea -- even the ones that seem absurd. You're creative enough to find diamonds in the rough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
