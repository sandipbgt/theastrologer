    "horoscope": "Learning is a gradual process, one that shouldn't be forced or hurried. In that spirit, take today to relax, regroup and refine your techniques in some area of your life that isn't working quite as smoothly as you'd prefer. You're open to learning something new and improving now, and once you've mastered these techniques, you can share them with others. It's great to pass on knowledge like this, Libra. It makes you feel good to give back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
