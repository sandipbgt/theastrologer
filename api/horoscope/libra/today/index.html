    "horoscope": "You can't decide anything today. All options are equally good or equally bad, depending on whether the glass is half full or half empty. But optimism won't last long under this kind of strain. Even if you're a mild-mannered, go-with-the-flow kind of person, uncertainty will make you moody and stubborn. That's only going to hold you back, you know. Maybe it's best to avoid others when you're feeling like this. They don't deserve you in this mood. And neither do you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
