If you're stuck at your desk all day, find a way to communicate with other people. Call someone on the phone, or chat via Instant Message. Send a text or an email. Better yet, get together with friends so you can talk and laugh in person.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
