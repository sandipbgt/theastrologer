    "horoscope": "Life is a little more fun today than usual, and you deserve a good bit of credit for the lighthearted vibe. Even if you're stuck at work or running errands, you joke with your coworkers or chat up friendly strangers. Soon, everyone's having a good time. You can be very productive today by tackling several quick tasks. Trying to focus on one longer project would just make you restless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
