    "horoscope": "Your native intelligence shines today. It's a wonderful day for a job interview, a presentation or any other situation in which you hope to impress someone. But it's not about gaining distinction. You don't care about recognition. You care about changing the world for the better. Toward that end, resolve to do at least one thing today to improve conditions for someone else.
