But today, you're feeling a bit insecure, and that could push you to spend money you don't have on status symbols that you don't need. Keep your credit cards safely in your wallet, where they belong. Remind yourself that people admire and respect you for who you are, not what you own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
