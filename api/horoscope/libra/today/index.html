You don't have to make a decision yet, and the absence of pressure feels good. Just keep testing the waters  -- you'll dive in when you're good and ready. If you take your time now and really feel things out, you'll be in a much better position to determine your next move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
