    "horoscope": "It's a great day to connect with your artistic side. Visiting an art gallery or a museum soothes your soul. Spending time in your garden or in nature gives you a grounded sense of well-being. Anything that promotes peace of mind is a good thing, because it helps you stay balanced, emotionally and otherwise. So tap into your inner sense of calmness and creativity. Enjoy exploring the natural world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
