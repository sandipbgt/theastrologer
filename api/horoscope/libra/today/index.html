    "horoscope": "You're in a romantic, affectionate mood today. The more time you can spend with your friends or loved ones, the better. If you're stuck at work or doing tedious chores, the day will seem to drag at a snail's pace. But time with your family will pick the speed right up. It's a great day for connecting with your friends, too. Go on a date or treat yourself to something sweet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
