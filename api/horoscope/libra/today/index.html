    "horoscope": "You're normally so agreeable, so tactful and charming -- what happened? Just kidding! Well, mostly. You do seem to be a little cheekier than usual. Saying what you really think is rare for you, so today will be a well-deserved departure from the norm. You'll let people know exactly what's on your mind. And at least you're listening fairly to their thoughts and responses, too. The beauty of all this is that your wild suggestions just might work. Give everyone time to absorb the solid method hidden within your current madness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
