    "horoscope": "It's a good day to bring order back to any area of your life that has gotten out of hand. The current influence helps you establish logical rules and systems to live by. This is useful whether you've been spending too much money, exercising too little, or anything else. It's an especially good time for anything career-related, so be sure to put some energy into that area of your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
