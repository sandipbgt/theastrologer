    "horoscope": "You're impulsive today, in the best possible way. You have a fun, vibrant sense of possibility. Somewhere within your mind or heart, you understand that your best opportunities will come through a willingness to take risks. On that note, if there's some personal choice or life change you've been considering but you haven't been certain about whether to go forward or not, this is the time to capitalize on your sense of adventure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
