    "horoscope": "Life is suddenly intense for everyone around you, and emotions are flying. You could feel a little off-kilter, but try to maintain your sense of balance, even when you're swamped with feeling. You have a deep desire for connection with another person now. Or, you could find yourself absorbed in creating a piece of artwork that expresses some meaningful aspect of your own soul. It's up to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
