    "horoscope": "You're often concerned with how others perceive you, and today that concern swells to actual worry. Perhaps you're anxious about your performance at work, or whether you'll get that raise or promotion you've been wanting. Try not to overspend on clothes or accessories in a bid to make yourself look more professional or appealing to others. It's good to dress to impress, but remember that your tact and intelligence speak volumes, as well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
