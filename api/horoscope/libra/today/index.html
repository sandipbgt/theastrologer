If a sense of melancholy sets in, recognize it for what it is: a fleeting emotion that may or may not be attached to events in your real life. Try not to place too much importance on worry or sadness today. Any feelings of this type will linger only briefly, and then dissipate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
