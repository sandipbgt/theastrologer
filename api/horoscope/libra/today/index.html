    "horoscope": "Your feelings are stirred up today, which may be an uncomfortable experience for you. It's hard to feel worries churn inside you. It's also tough when your friends or relatives aren't getting along, or when you're having a rift with a friend. Any of these is a possibility now. The good news is that it's a great day to reach out to someone and repair your bond. Reaffirm your commitment and your loving connection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
