    "horoscope": "You've always been a people-pleaser, and you might be a little too accommodating today. That's nothing new, but do try a new way of dealing with this issue. Be gentle but firm about enforcing your limits when you reach them, whether that's during your workout, in an intimate relationship or when doing favors for a friend. Remember, you need to take care of you first. Everyone else can wait until you've tended to Number One.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
