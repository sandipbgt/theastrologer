    "horoscope": "You're always concerned with fairness and equality, and your sign is known for its focus on achieving balance and harmony. Now your mind reaches even higher. Elevated concepts like integrity and legality become your principles to live by today. There's no room here for slippery dealings; this is all about being aboveboard and ethical in everything you do. Taking the high road should help with any indecision you may feel today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
