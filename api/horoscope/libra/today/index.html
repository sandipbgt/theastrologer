    "horoscope": "If you've ever thought you had psychic abilities of any kind, expect them to be heightened today. Of course, this may just be your keen, sensitive mind at work.

Sensing their feelings makes you feel responsible for them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
