Instead of surrendering your individuality to the highest bidder, use some of that sharp spiciness as a barrier. You can also show everyone what you're made of by speaking your mind. If you're worried about getting along with people, be tactful, but remain honest. That way, everyone, including you, knows exactly where you stand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
