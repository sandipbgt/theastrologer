    "horoscope": "Don't let career worries or squabbles at home get you down. Today could seem a bit rough, but good things come from challenges. You're strong enough to handle whatever roadblocks come your way, even as you hide your inner strength behind a veneer of smiles. Push yourself to get through the day as gracefully as possible. When you feel like frowning, smile. When you feel like crying, laugh. Get some exercise, and take a nap. You'll pull through with flying colors.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
