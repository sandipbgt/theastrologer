    "horoscope": "Old memories crowd your mind today. Perhaps a phone call or email brings up the past. In some way, you'll find yourself balanced between what has gone before and what you're striving to move toward. This could be an uncomfortable sensation, especially if you feel stretched between family expectations and your own goals, or if an issue with a loved one needs to be resolved. Think logically as well as emotionally.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
