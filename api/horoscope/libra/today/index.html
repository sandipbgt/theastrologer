    "horoscope": "Today, feelings of impatience are building to a crescendo. If you don't do something to remedy this tension, soon you'll be more fretful than a stringed instrument. So why not play a relaxing tune and calm down? You don't have to give in to your anxieties, you know. Remind yourself that these are just feelings, and not necessarily reflections of reality. Maybe that will help you acknowledge them and then dismiss them in short order.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
