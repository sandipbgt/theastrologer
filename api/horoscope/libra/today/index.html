    "horoscope": "Seek what you know you can find, instead of reaching for the stars. Connect and merge with those who'll accept you, rather than storming the gates of places where you'd never fit in. Is it really OK to rely so much on those  moments of ecstasy, discovery and bonding? You'd hate to turn into just another experience junkie, because those people are like perpetual tourists, always looking and never satisfied. Climb outside of yourself to get a better view of who you are and why you desire what you do. Find kindred spirits today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
