You can review your budget or hash things out with your partner in a levelheaded way, with an eye for improvement. So don't worry if it seems like there's a lot to figure out at the moment. You'll have all the time you need. Just take it slowly, and keep putting one foot in front of the other.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
