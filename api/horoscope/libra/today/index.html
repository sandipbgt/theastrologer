    "horoscope": "You love peace, but at the moment, you don't need quiet. You're in a great mood and you're definitely up for company. There's a spring in your walk and pep in every move you make. You can really impress the right people. In terms of business, any strides you take today will be productive ones that go in the right direction. Don't be afraid to rely on friends and coworkers for assistance. Most of all, enjoy this positive feeling!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
