But for now, you're free from that timid feeling. Instead of worrying or putting out a lot of extra effort, you're ready to let loose and make merry. Today is your personal holiday -- no matter what the calendar or your boss might say -- so have fun!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
