    "horoscope": "It's another day of organizing anything in your life that's out of balance. It feels good to establish a system where, previously, there had been chaos. You'll feel more lighthearted knowing you've cleared the decks -- especially since you'll soon have the start of a whole new personal cycle. Today, wrap up any ongoing projects you have on your plate, and then wait for the next influx of purposeful energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
