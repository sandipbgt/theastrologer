For example, if you're tempted to relax and enjoy yourself a little too much, the 'gentle leader' image will remind you to get back to the task at hand. And if a disagreement arises at work or at home, that image will help you tap into your conflict-resolution skills.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
