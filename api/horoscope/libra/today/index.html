You're putting out such positive light and energy that people can't help but be drawn into your aura! It's a great day for good times with your favorite people. Gather a loud, fun-loving group together, or grab your favorite person for some one-on-one time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
