    "horoscope": "Today is about smart, calculated self-limitation. That means making a conscious choice to spend less money, resist the urge for a second helping, or decline a social invitation because you know you need to get more work done. These small acts of self-discipline might make life feel a little less bright and sparkly, but it's just for today. And cutting back now will pay big dividends later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
