    "horoscope": "If you feel a little frisky, a little cocky, a little amped up, don't be surprised: You're operating under some bold energy. You're far more vocal than usual about how you see the world. But though it may feel good to shout out your truth for once, there's really no need to be so aggressive about it. You're completely authentic today, which means you can afford to be gentle with other people. Your best course of action now is to act quietly and decisively. That way, you'll draw allies instead ofto your side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
