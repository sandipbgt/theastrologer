    "horoscope": "You're hardly known for your thick skin. Quite the opposite, in fact: Your friends love you for how sensitive you are. Developing a more durable hide might be today's important lesson for you, however. For instance, if someone is nasty toward you, don't dignify them with a response. The path of least resistance is better than wasting time with hurt feelings, or flaring up and starting a fight. And who knows? Perhaps you were just feeling overly sensitive. Maybe they didn't mean anything by it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
