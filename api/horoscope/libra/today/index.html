    "horoscope": "You'll be a civil presence at work and a wholesome influence on your friends and family today. You'll inspire everyone around you to be a little softer with their criticisms and easier on themselves as well as on one another. In turn, they could inspire you with their ideas for completing some important project or resolving an issue you've been wrestling with. The lesson of this brief, sweet period is that if you live carefully, you may learn to be carefree. This experience is sure to be good for what ails you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
