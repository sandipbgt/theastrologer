    "horoscope": "Use today's high, optimistic energy to make plans for the future. As always, consider which friends or professional associates you'd like to team up with on a certain endeavor. Whose input do you most value? Whose support is most helpful when you reach a rough patch? These are good questions to ask yourself as you size up the project in your head and start fleshing out a team.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
