    "horoscope": "Today you feel young and restless. You can feel things changing under the surface, even if you can't yet see how the new form will take shape. That's okay with you, since you're open to possibility and ready for adventure. It's a good way to be, even if nothing happens. Enjoy this youthful flexibility while you have it. Soon, all your creative ideas will take form and become real.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
