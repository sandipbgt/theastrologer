For the moment, it's enough that you're known among your friends. If you're single, this could be a very good time for a date with someone new, since you're sure to impress them. If you're already partnered up, put some effort into wooing your honey. The current energy is ripe for romance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
