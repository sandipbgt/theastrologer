    "horoscope": "Your mind is sharp but your heart is as soft as ever, making you an ideal companion today. With the wisdom of an old soul, you'll offer good advice to friends and colleagues. But with the enthusiasm of a child, you'll enjoy downtime spent with the people you love. A project may be easier than usual, because you're so attuned to both details and balance. Be sure to hold on to the best of both these sides of yourself -- the child and the old soul, the detail-oriented worker bee and the wise person with the balanced perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
