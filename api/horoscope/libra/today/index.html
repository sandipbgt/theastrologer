Whether you're single or coupled, it's easy now to get caught up in fantasies of the 'perfect' mate or relationship -- though that doesn't exist except in your mind! Try to appreciate your partner or your life for what it is. That's true romance: falling in love all over again with what you already have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
