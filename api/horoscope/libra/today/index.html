    "horoscope": "If you think about it, you have everything you need -- and yet you're still grumbling about being shortchanged in some way. Can you at least try to be a bit more gracious? The current energy lends itself so much better to friendliness and generosity. Instead of focusing on the things you think you lack, focus on sharing what you have with someone else. This should help you feel better, and remind you that you're actually doing pretty well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
