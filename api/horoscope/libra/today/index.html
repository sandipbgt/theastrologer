    "horoscope": "You're totally OK with elegant, heartfelt solutions. And there's so much of that going around, too. You're in the habit of respecting other people's deep genius. Turnabout is fair pay, and they'll surprise you today. Let them stand back and feast their eyes, because it'll be your turn. Yes, that's right. This is no time to be shy about going for all the cool stuff you can. You've just seen who you're sharing the world with. Whether they're competitors or partners, you should be up for the challenge by now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
