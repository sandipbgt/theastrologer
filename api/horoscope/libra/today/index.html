    "horoscope": "Giving is beautiful whatever the gift might be. Just look at the math and physics of it. All this simple equation needs is you as the giver and someone else as the receiver. What are you passing along here? Love? Money? Time? Copies of your music collection? It all depends on how much you like the person on the receiving end, because you could be giving them grief, bad information or computer viruses. But you know what? Don't dwell on all this dark matter. Forget your expectations and start something unique. See where it takes you today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
