    "horoscope": "Communication with other people takes up much of your day. Conversations, phone calls and email or instant message exchanges are enjoyably stimulating. And they reveal plenty of information you can use later. Be sure to keep a pen and paper handy to jot down all the ideas that come to you. Don't try to decide now whether or not they're viable. Just get them down, and decide later if you can use them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
