You will affect the space around you, and you won't be making any friends if you're sharp, angry or resentful. Your complaints may be totally valid, but don't go around beating others over the head with them. Instead, you might want to spend the day mending fences or even tearing down useless walls. Old grievances will hurt less once you restructure things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
