    "horoscope": "Your feelings go up and down today. One minute you're feeling fine, but the next, you're remembering an old flame or a beloved relative, and emotion washes over you like a wave. Worries about money or your future could also crowd in, making for a confusing situation, to say the least. But you can get a handle on your emotions simply by talking them out or writing them down.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
