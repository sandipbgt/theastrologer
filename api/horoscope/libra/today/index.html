    "horoscope": "Reach out to people you think you can trust. Conspire and cooperate. Initiate newcomers into your secret order, whether you're bringing them on board for something silly or serious. Of course this will look selfish to outsiders, but true insiders should be delighted to share. You'll do your part, anyway. For today, new blood will be the wonderful, critical, mysterious element that could turn this little costume drama into an act of importance. And you'll be coordinating the whole thing like some imperial puppet master. How cool is that?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
