But it's all too easy for you to get stuck in a relationship or situation that doesn't serve you, simply because it's easy and you're used to it. Try not to depend so much on set patterns. Instead, start thinking now about how to liberate yourself. Claiming your freedom won't be scary. In fact, it should feel strangely good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
