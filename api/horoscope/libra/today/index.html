    "horoscope": "Your easygoing nature might not be your friend today. It depends on how much you want the hard work you're likely to attract. People will expect you to give them, solve their disputes or suggest what they get for lunch. Wow them with your fair, obvious judgments, and hope they take the hint about thinking for themselves and leaving you alone. But try to be a good sport if everyone doesn't see the light. You have to admit it's funny being so popular for doing so little.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
