    "horoscope": "No matter what age you are in years, today you feel fresh-faced and youthful. Life seems as bright and shiny as a new penny. You know the world holds opportunities, and they're yours for the taking. The key is to think and act independently. That doesn't mean you have to act alone -- yours is the sign of partnership, after all. But do challenge yourself to be open-minded and freethinking.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
