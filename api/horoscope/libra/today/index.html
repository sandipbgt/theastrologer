    "horoscope": "Good feelings and compliments abound today. You're as gracious about receiving gifts as you are generous about giving them. This a great time for parties, dates and other get-togethers. Of course, even at a party with friends, you can still be in networking mode. In fact, today could be very constructive if you focus on communicating with lots of different people. You're reaching out now, which helps you make connections, even as you strategize your next move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
