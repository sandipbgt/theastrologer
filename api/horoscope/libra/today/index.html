    "horoscope": "The strangers you run into now seem especially funny, and your neighbors are flat-out lovely. It's great to smile and laugh with everyone -- why not take it a step further?

Gathering with loved ones is favored now,, especially if it means traveling some distance to do so.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
