When it comes to matters that affect your friends, coworkers or family, you want everyone to have an equal say before any decisions are made. Now it's easy to create that balance. You're listening well and expressing your ideas with an appealing energy. You can draw people to your corner or explain your views.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
