    "horoscope": "You're feeling stubborn, but this is no time to hide your feelings or be manipulative or deceptive in any way. Instead, be as open and honest about your agenda as possible. People need to know where you stand. They might have no idea how you really feel, so putting your emotions, needs and expectations into words is important. Someone else could actually benefit from knowing you feel so passionately about things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
