You never know from where inspiration might come. Furthermore, you can offer useful advice to others when it's needed. They'll appreciate your balanced viewpoint. In general, life will be easy and positive today. You're in good health and spirits, and you're doing the right things to stay that way. Why not focus on figuring out how to make these good feelings last?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
