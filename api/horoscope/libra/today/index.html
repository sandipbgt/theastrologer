    "horoscope": "Your instincts are humming today. Will you heed their wisdom, or assume nothing is true unless you can support it with logical, tangible experiences? You're used to thinking creatively, so it shouldn't be too difficult to take a leap of faith in your ideas. And oh, the benefits you'll reap. This is especially favorable if you work in a creative field, but following your intuition now is a positive thing regardless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
