    "horoscope": "Today is an excellent day for a group project, especially one that requires brainstorming, creativity and energetic output. These are among your strengths right now. Perhaps you have a meeting at the office or need to act as a diplomat between friends who are arguing. Even if you're just playing a board game with your family, you'll find that you benefit from others' energy. Being around people sharpens your own ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
