    "horoscope": "Since harmony is important to you, you're usually easygoing with your friends and loved ones. But today, you might be downright submissive. There's no reason you should sacrifice your own needs for someone else's, but you'll do just that if it seems like the only way to maintain closeness. A generous quality is certainly important in relationships, but just make sure you aren't giving away anything truly vital.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
