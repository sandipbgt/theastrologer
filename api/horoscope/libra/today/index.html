    "horoscope": "Somehow you're lighter than, free, spontaneous and rising. Don't you just love that floating feeling? You're buoyant even on dry land. Access to privileged places could be yours today. Knowledge is forever, and love can last even longer than that. Try to keep all this in perspective, though. For instance, be more tactful around the have-nots. You don't want to rub their noses in what's missing from their lives. If you can't share, at least don't show off. And anyway, wouldn't it be better to have this kind of fun in private?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
