Lots of folks have an in-your-face way of challenging each other now, and you could get caught in the crossfire, or even become the focus. But don't mistake high-spirited ribbing or debates for actual conflict. There's a distinct difference.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
