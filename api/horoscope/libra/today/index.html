    "horoscope": "You're a people person by nature, so you know how to get along in almost any gathering. This is an important skill to use today. Even if you have to offer someone criticism or make a tough decision, you can do so with gentle politeness. It's all in how you word it, and you're a master at crafting beautiful words. Emphasize fairness, and no one will find fault with your actions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
