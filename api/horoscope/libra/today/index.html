    "horoscope": "Hey, what's with the mood shifts and attitude? Why are you so temperamental now? Maybe you're starting to doubt the so-called truths you've been told. Maybe there are so many variables that you don't even know what to believe any more. Then there are the people who don't seem to have these problems. Do you resent their easy lives? Be nice to them today, and maybe they'll let you in. But keep in mind that once the visit gets old, once the party winds down, their lives aren't that different from yours. So much for jealousy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
