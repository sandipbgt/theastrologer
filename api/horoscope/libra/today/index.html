You're more responsive to meetings and group efforts, where you can discuss interesting ideas and brainstorm as a team. You're also perfectly fine with hanging out in the break room and chatting with whoever happens to drop by! And that's okay. Sometimes, the best, most creative and unique ideas strike when you're just riffing with someone inspiring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
