    "horoscope": "They can't get enough of you. Maybe this flatters you. Maybe you've already had way too much of them and just want to be alone. You'll blow hot and cold today. So what? You never set out to lead anybody on. You just happen to like people, and it was a charming moment. Good friends will understand your mood.
