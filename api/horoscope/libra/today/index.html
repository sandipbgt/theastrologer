    "horoscope": "You've never been short on imagination, and other people intrigue you as much as beauty, justice, and creativity. Today, your natural curiosity will influence your decisions in a big way. You're hungry for new people, new information, new experiences. Get out of the house, or even out of town -- this kind of lusty energy begs for a new perspective. Wherever you are, think broadly and redraw your map of the world, making it larger and more inclusive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
