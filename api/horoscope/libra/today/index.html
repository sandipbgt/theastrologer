    "horoscope": "Ordinarily you're so generous, but a vulnerable mood has you hoarding resources now. Sharing is well worth the effort, though -- even if it feels like a challenge. Isolation may seem appealing, but what you should really be doing is reaching out to family, neighbors and strangers alike. Dare yourself to work through the minor upsets you've encountered recently. Being good to yourself would be a start. Go work out at the gym. Then cook up something delicious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
