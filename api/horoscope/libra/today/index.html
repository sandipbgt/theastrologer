Honesty is key, because it lets everyone know where they stand. If everyone's agenda is clear, then it's easier to figure out how to adjust your plan so it benefits more people. That being said, do what you have to do. Hey, at least you're having fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
