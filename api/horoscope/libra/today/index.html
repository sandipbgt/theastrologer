You're not too nice to play up your advantages, though, and that's a good thing. Today is your time to shine, so use every gift, talent and opportunity you can. Just make sure you're still approachable. You want to create your own success, but not at the expense of someone's friendship or respect. Knowing you, you'll strike that balance with ease.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
