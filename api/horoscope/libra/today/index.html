    "horoscope": "Protocol, manners and discretion are vital today. It's all about following the rules. You know the drill -- charm and diplomacy help you succeed, but aloof or arrogant behavior will only hinder your progress. Do your best to promote good feelings between people, and nothing else will matter. There's a deeper meaning to your existence. Find it today, in relationships, nature or study -- whatever rings your bells!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
