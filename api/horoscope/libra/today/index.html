    "horoscope": "Today is a day for spontaneous acts of self-liberation. Especially if you've been working hard lately, it's time to explore and celebrate your freedom, whatever that means to you! Travel is highlighted now, so hit the road if you can. But the world of ideas is just as thrilling as the physical world. Even reading a book or seeing a film can open your mind to something fascinating that you never thought about before.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
