    "horoscope": "Your bohemian side comes up today. There's little you enjoy more than trading ideas and philosophies with friends. And if you can gather in a coffee shop while wearing black berets, so much the better! All jokes aside, getting inspired is easy now. You have flashes of insight at every turn, and this goes beyond mere cleverness. Follow your hunches. You could be on to something truly unusual and astonishing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
