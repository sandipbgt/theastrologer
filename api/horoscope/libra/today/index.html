Either way, you may find yourself sifting through your recollections, pressing on spots in your mind as you might press a bruise, to see if it still hurts. This is a good exercise, even if it makes you sad or lonely. The only way to process your feelings is to feel them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
