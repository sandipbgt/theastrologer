Waffling and indecision are possible now Should you follow your instincts, your emotions or your intellect? This is a weighty question. Still, maybe you don't have to take things quite so seriously. After all, it's only one day. And you've got lots of energy. Focus on being invigorated, and let time lead you down the right path.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
