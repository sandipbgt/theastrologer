    "horoscope": "Today, don't be afraid to step in if tension develops at work or among friends. You can play negotiator, serving as the voice of reason when everyone else is too stubborn or upset to give ground. Of course, if you're directly involved in the conflict, you may bend over too far backward in an attempt to restore harmony. If you give too much for too little in return, balance has not been restored.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
