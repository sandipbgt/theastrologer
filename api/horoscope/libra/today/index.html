    "horoscope": "High spirits will lead you on. Solid beliefs will keep your head from getting too far ahead of your feet. Can you see the balance and symmetry of it all? Also notice that your goal will start looking a lot closer today. As much as you approve of how you're doing now, don't let your ambitions and desires eclipse your friendships. Your companions are part of this whole adventure, too, and they deserve their share of the light and heat you'll be putting out. Success is always sweeter when you can share it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
