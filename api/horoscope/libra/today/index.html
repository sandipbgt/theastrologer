    "horoscope": "You may feel a little isolated today as you go about your business, but if so, know that it's a temporary state of mind. Everyone's a bit on the serious side now, it's true. Life may seem humorless. But this offers you the perfect opportunity to buckle down and get something accomplished. Focus is yours if you summon it, and you'll certainly impress your clients or employer by being so industrious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
