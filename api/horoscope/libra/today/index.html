    "horoscope": "Feeling chatty, are you? Sure, you'll be verbal today, but there's no edge or angle to your patter. It's more like peacefully shooting the breeze. You can tell people about your life and ask them to relate their own stories. Maybe you'll come across someone who sparks an important idea, or simply end up with a new friend or two. But these good things will happen only if you pursue them, so be sure to reach out to other people now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
