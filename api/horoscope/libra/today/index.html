    "horoscope": "The balance just tipped. Push came to shove. You have to take action now, so drop what you're doing. You've let things go for so long that the moment demands motion. At least your charm will make it easy, so switch on the company manners and you're good to go. And if you're feeling creative, your sense of fun could even turn this thing into some new sport. Live richly in the moment, and before you know what's happening, this moment will stretch out for a full day. See how far you can take it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
