    "horoscope": "The world is full of hotheads today. That's the current influence at work. Folks are making rash decisions and jumping to conclusions. Don't be surprised if you witness an argument, or worse, get involved in one yourself. And this is despite the fact that you do whatever you can to avoid conflict! Sometimes, it's inevitable. At least you're the type to fight fair. You can keep a disagreement from getting out of hand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
