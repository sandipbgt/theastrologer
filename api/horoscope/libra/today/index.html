Surely you can't be expected to think of everything. And the more things go wrong, the thicker you can spread that blame. You may feel entitled now, but it's a luxury that'll come back to bite you later. Why not keep the debt and gossip to a minimum while you still can? Don't involve anyone new in your little secret today. Things are confusing enough already.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
