    "horoscope": "Today might be one of those days when you're too nice for your own good. You're feeling vulnerable, and perhaps even insecure. Your edges are softer than usual, and you're treating others with a gentle touch. But be gentle with yourself, too. If that means withdrawing from a tough situation for a day or two, that's okay. Don't deal with bullies or hard choices if it makes you feel bad.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
