    "horoscope": "Close relationships are on your mind today. Your connection with your spouse or a business associate may need attention. It's a good day to get back on track if things have become imbalanced between you. After all, even minor inequalities can build up over time. If one of you consistently takes on more responsibility than the other, a sense of resentment could build. Avoid that by making sure you're both pulling your weight.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
