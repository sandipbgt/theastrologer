    "horoscope": "Expect some emotional ups and downs today, whether your own or someone else's. The current energy makes many people feel more sensitive than usual, which can have both positive and challenging effects. On the positive side, it's a wonderful day to share a loving or romantic moment with someone who is dear to you. On the challenging side, feelings could be hurt, either yours or theirs. Tread gently, dear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
