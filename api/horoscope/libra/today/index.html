    "horoscope": "You have a goal in mind -- something you'd like to accomplish within the next month. You're excited about it, but you know you can't reach it alone. It's a great day to ask your friends or business associates for help. Getting others' perspectives or their support is a smart way to operate. Just don't let conflicting opinions throw you off. In the end, your opinion is the one that matters most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
