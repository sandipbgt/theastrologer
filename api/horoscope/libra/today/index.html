    "horoscope": "You may not feel particularly strong today, and that's why it's especially important to protect yourself in relationships and negotiations. It's all too easy now to give up too much. You may not even know what you want. Your own needs are tangled up with your awareness of the other person's feelings. How can you honor both equally? That's your challenge for today. Be forewarned that it may be difficult, but aim towards it anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
