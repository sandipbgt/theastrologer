After all, gushing won't help nearly so much as simple affirmations that show how much you value everyone's support. And it's not as if you don't deserve it. You've gained this support through hard work and careful planning, not to mention being a good person. So take the recognition in stride and appreciate it properly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
