    "horoscope": "Leave it to you to make a shrewd perspective look like sweet, friendly charm. Your eye is sharp and your mind keen today, and even the smallest detail won't escape your notice. Could this be a hidden talent revealing itself? Of course, you've always been great at analyzing people and situations. It's the folks around you who may be surprised to find you're not as compliant as you seem. The good news is, they're delighted to find your judgment so sharp. You'll impress them even more if you really let these inner talents shine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
