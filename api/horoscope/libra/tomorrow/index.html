    "horoscope": "Good manners are OK, but enough is enough. Stop with the bowing and scraping already. You're all friends and equals here, remember? You get to do whatever you like, for today anyway. There won't be any parents, teachers or bosses lecturing you, whether in real life or inside your head. Plus, your credit is pre-approved. Now that you have this little window of freedom, what's the plan? Bring your potential and talents online. Start or finish something important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
