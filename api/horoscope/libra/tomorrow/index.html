Rather than expecting the impossible, just keep gathering information. As you work on organizing and processing it, you'll learn enough that you'll have something to tell other people when they become more interested in your project. It's always best to be well informed, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
