    "horoscope": "You hate disappointing others, but right now that's less of a concern than usual. You're blowing off others left and right as you tend to your own demanding emotional needs. Do you think you're winning yourself any allies? Probably not. And you know flaky behavior doesn't become you, but that's your M.O. -- today, anyway. Turn this around. Engage with the world instead of disappearing from it. Get involved in a positive way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
