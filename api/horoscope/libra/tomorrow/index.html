    "horoscope": "You're extra open-minded today. In fact, you might even purposely seek out people who are different from you, or want to try cuisine, art or other experiences that are outside the realm of the familiar.

You have a thirst for new knowledge, so anything that teaches you something new or leaves you with a fresh perspective on the world is a good thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
