That goes for personal projects as well as professional ones. Everything is enhanced by input from people you respect -- as long as their input doesn't eclipse your own. Work now on striking a balance between listening to others' opinions while asserting your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
