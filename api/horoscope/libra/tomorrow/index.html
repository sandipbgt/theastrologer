Hard work is important, and it's rewarding if you love what you do. But if you're only pursuing a goal in hopes of impressing others, you may end up wearing yourself out -- and you still won't feel satisfied. In the end, your self-respect is the only thing that counts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
