    "horoscope": "You've been trying your hardest. You've been wearing the biggest smile you've got and speaking in your sweetest voice. And yet, you just can't seem to win them over. All this toxic niceness is backfiring. It's time to do something decisive to save the situation, or at least yourself. Today, figure out a way to shake them awake by other means. And don't neglect the benefits of stating your case or your opinion plainly. You tend to avoid being direct with people, but sometimes it's the only way to get through to them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
