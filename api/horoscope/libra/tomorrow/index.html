    "horoscope": "Life turns sober today. You might prefer a more lighthearted atmosphere, but this is a good opportunity to take care of business. Family or work responsibilities are calling you, and it's time to respond. Your natural diplomacy helps you deal with even sticky situations tactfully. That will come in handy now, as you navigate your way through balancing other people's needs and expectations with your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
