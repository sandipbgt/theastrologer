    "horoscope": "People are a little restless today, especially if they've been spending too much time with other people or trying to be cheerful even when they don't feel so good inside. This could be a tense day for some -- but probably not for you. You're genuinely cheerful, because your heart feels light, warm and loving. Spread your good vibes to anyone nearby who needs them.
