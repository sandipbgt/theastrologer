    "horoscope": "Your good spirits are infectious today. Even in the most tedious gathering, you're able to keep everyone relaxed and laughing. You weave connections where other people can't. Best of all, you'll keep people looking on the bright side of things, towards a better future. This makes it easier to discuss methods and ideas people might normally consider too unusual to consider. And it certainly keeps conversations interesting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
