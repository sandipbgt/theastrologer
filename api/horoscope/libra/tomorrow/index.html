    "horoscope": "Seek out new people and experiences today. You're especially open-minded now, which has benefits beyond your own life and ongoing education. Your ability to project nonjudgmental acceptance helps other people, too, because it models that value for them. You're setting an example by being your friendly, tolerant self. So embrace the unfamiliar, even folks or concepts that seem pretty out there. You'll probably learn something valuable from them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
