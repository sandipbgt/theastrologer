Time is limited, too, which makes it extra important to keep an eye on the clock. This is one of those days when being five minutes late can skew your whole schedule. So stay on track. Soon, life should get lively again. Right now, it's all about focused effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
