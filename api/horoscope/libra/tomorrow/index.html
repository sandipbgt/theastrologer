    "horoscope": "Passionate feelings swell under today's influence. You can have a wonderful time exploring these whether you're single or coupled. Watching a romantic comedy is a great way to feed into this energy. So is creating a work of art that expresses your emotions. You crave company, so make it a point to spend time with friends. Laugh, share, and reaffirm the bonds that hold you together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
