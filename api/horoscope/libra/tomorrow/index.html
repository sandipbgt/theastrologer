    "horoscope": "Work duties weigh heavily upon you today. Or you help a family member. You push yourself to go above and beyond the call of duty. It's possible now be pessimistic without even realizing it. Try not to lose sight of your goal, which is to achieve balance in all things. Do the needful for your job or relatives, but reserve time for yourself and your friends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
