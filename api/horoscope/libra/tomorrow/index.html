    "horoscope": "Don't even try to please everyone -- it's especially impossible today. Your focus is off, and so are your instincts. You're swinging back and forth between the magnificent and the utterly tasteless. Well, at least you have diverse interests, which can be fun, given the right company and setting. Spend time with someone you care about -- if you're attracted to them, even better. But don't waste energy trying to be what you think they want. Instead, be yourself, plain and simple. And don't worry -- this uneasy feeling will pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
