    "horoscope": "A restless energy blows through today, livening your spirits. Spending the day on your own, with no one to talk to, would be very dull indeed! If you're stuck at your desk all day, find a way to communicate with other people. Call someone on the phone, or chat via Instant Message. Send a text or an email. Better yet, get together with friends so you can talk and laugh in person.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
