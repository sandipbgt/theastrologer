    "horoscope": "The easiest way to avoid a battle today is to keep to yourself. Don't say anything that's not absolutely necessary, which includes most of your current opinions -- your view of the world is a little screwy at the moment. Your energy is off, and it's better for everyone if you just sit back and take it easy. Of course, withdrawing completely won't do, either. Find a happy medium between 'lone wolf' and 'in your face aggression.' Spend time with people you love and trust.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
