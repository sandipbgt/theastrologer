    "horoscope": "You have a lot of concern for other people today. So much so, in fact, that you might neglect your own needs in your quest to fulfill others'. It's easy to let someone take advantage of your kindness today. You don't even realize you're bending over too far backwards until you fall down! Spend time with people you know well and trust deeply. They will help you avoid issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
