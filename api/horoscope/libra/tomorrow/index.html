    "horoscope": "Is it you, or has life just gotten a whole lot more fun? You're passionate, affectionate and expressive now, and you're whipping up a frenzy of admiration. Some people would be a little, overeager with all this attention, but you're graceful even in the midst of excitement. Better get out the camera. You may want to document this day, so you can look back later and smile as you remember everything you got up to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
