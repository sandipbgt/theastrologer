    "horoscope": "You aren't used to operating under such revved-up energy, are you? You're ordinarily so peaceable that you don't quite know what to do with yourself today. Of course, chasing down bold schemes is kind of fun, and even the restless harmony that fills your soul feels interesting. This is a great time to get things done -- big things, like pet projects you've been wanting to get off the ground for some time. Just make sure you exercise a bit of self-discipline. Mastering your impulses might be annoying, but it could mean the difference between success and failure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
