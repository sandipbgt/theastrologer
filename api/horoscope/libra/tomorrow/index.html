    "horoscope": "If you've ever thought you had psychic abilities of any kind, expect them to be heightened today. Of course, this may just be your keen, sensitive mind at work. It's easier than usual to pick up on subtle cues and signals from your environment. You're ultra aware of how the people around you are feeling -- perhaps more aware than you want to be! Sensing their feelings makes you feel responsible for them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
