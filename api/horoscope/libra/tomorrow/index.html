    "horoscope": "Be careful. There's royalty, sensitive loved ones or a baby in the house. Mind your manners today, just in case you're about to make an impression on someone who matters. Be alert to what others want, even if it's something you'd never even consider. But you don't have to go around compromising your future. Just be yourself in the right time and place where prying eyes and ears have no business. That way, they'll have something on you, you'll have something on them, and you can all laugh about it. Once you break the tension, everything is beautiful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
