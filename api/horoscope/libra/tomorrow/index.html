    "horoscope": "You're ardently passionate about someone or something today. These feelings could easily become obsessive, which may or may not be a bad thing. If you're immersing yourself in a creative work or a healthy relationship, then have fun with the intensity of feeling. But if you're feeling drawn toward someone who isn't appropriate for you, remind yourself that feelings change quickly. Try not to do anything you'll regret later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
