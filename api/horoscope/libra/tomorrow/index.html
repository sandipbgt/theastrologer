    "horoscope": "You're naturally creative, so you're inclined to use that skill in everything you do. But today, an imaginative touch may not be necessary for getting things done -- and it might even hinder things. The kind of energy at work today calls for a traditional, cautious approach to problem-solving and personal advancement. So even if your instincts urge you to add a pretty flourish, take the most straightforward route toward your goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
