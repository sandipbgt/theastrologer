    "horoscope": "You're working within a limited budget today, and that can be tough. You're used to being lavish and indulgent with your resources -- sometimes, beyond what you can actually afford. On second thought, maybe this is a good lesson for you: to rein in your desires and live within your means, if only for today. Even if life feels a little bleak now, you'll feel better about yourself tomorrow, knowing you can tighten your belt when necessary.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
