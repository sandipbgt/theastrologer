    "horoscope": "You truly want everyone around you to be happy. Today, that comes out in the form of heartfelt generosity. Sometimes your giving can be a little over the top. It's the difference between treating a friend to lunch, or treating the whole table to a lavish dinner! But as long as everyone is smiling and enjoying themselves, you don't mind the cost. That's part of your charm!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
