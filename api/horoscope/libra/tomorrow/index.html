    "horoscope": "Today is a cool, lively breeze playing over the landscape of your life. This should come as a welcome reprieve, especially if you've been bogged down with work or complex emotional entanglements. Your inner free spirit has come out to play and couldn't be in a better mood. It's a great time to connect with an old friend or someone new and special. In any situation, even the simplest ones, responding from the heart feels honest and wonderful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
