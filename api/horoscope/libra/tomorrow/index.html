    "horoscope": "It's the golden rule in action. It's that whole thing about getting what you give, all over again. Show kindness if you want to be treated kindly. Be affectionate if you want affection. Other people here already believe in your basic decency, and by now they've probably forgiven or forgotten most of your bigger mistakes. In some ways, you're a blank slate. Use today and demonstrate that you deserve their trust. See what a little good cheer, cooperation and honesty can do for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
