    "horoscope": "Stop worrying! No one's really upset with you. Friendly relations still run strong, just the way you like them. You thrive on peace and harmony, and they're as present now as ever. So what's the problem? Perhaps you made a mistake recently, and someone has given you some feedback on how you could do things differently next time. Don't take this personally. No one else is upset about your slip-up, so you have a full day to fix it without worrying about apologies or hurt feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
