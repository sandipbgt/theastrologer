    "horoscope": "Today you'll lavish your attention on material things. New shoes, a stylish outfit, that shiny new camera phone... But this sudden urge to possess more stuff denotes more than just temporary materialism. It means you're feeling a bit insecure, and you're trying to fill that void with possessions, to make yourself feel safe. Remember, sentiment matters more than market value. Seek spiritual a connection. Soon you'll be feeling quite balanced and content.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
