    "horoscope": "Intellectually, you're perfectly in your element today. Your mind is like a finely tuned machine. Wonderfully witty, imaginative ideas appear out of nowhere -- but if you aren't careful to record them in some way, they'll fade into the ether. Your creativity is high, but you may not have the presence of mind to follow through even on the most brilliant idea. Save it for later, when your motivation is higher.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
