Instead of talking openly to everyone who will listen about your feelings or your plans, adopt a quiet alertness. Keep your eyes and ears open, and your mouth closed. This may seem unfriendly, but it's not. Sometimes it's just smart to protect yourself. Keep things under wraps until you know it's the right time to reveal the truth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
