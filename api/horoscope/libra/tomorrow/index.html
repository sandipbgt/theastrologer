But even as you squint and grin in the glittering spray of the moment, you should be paying attention to the small things that are getting swept away. You'll hate it later if you couldn't find where you left them. So take a snapshot, sketch out a map or use whatever little trick works to keep things fixed in your memory. Today you'll need the complete picture. Only then will you really be able to abandon yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
