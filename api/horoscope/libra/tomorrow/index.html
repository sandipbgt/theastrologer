You might have a deep discussion with a friend that leaves you both feeling more centered and self-aware. But it's also possible that an argument with your sweetheart leaves you feeling vulnerable and confused. Stay true to yourself, even if things get confusing. You'll work it out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
