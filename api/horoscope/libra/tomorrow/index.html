    "horoscope": "Today, it's as if a fresh breeze has blown into your life, bringing along interesting people and ideas for you to play with. It's a great day to spend time with friends both old and new. You're drawn to creative folks who can inspire your own inventive streak. So be sociable, but with a purpose. Discuss creative projects, and ask for feedback on your ideas. Turn every gathering into a brainstorming session.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
