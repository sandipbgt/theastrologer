Your edges are softer than usual, and you're treating others with a gentle touch. But be gentle with yourself, too. If that means withdrawing from a tough situation for a day or two, that's okay. Don't deal with bullies or hard choices if it makes you feel bad.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
