    "horoscope": "You're full of vivid, creative ideas now, and you can really make something of them if you put both your mind and your heart into it. That shouldn't be difficult, either: You're filled with fun, vibrant energy. If you can make this a group project, so much the better. Why not paint a room in your house with some friends, or get your work-mates on board for a bold and exciting new undertaking? Whatever you do, it's time to be creative,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
