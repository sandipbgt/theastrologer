    "horoscope": "Today will surge with aspiring and desiring. You want, you'll try, and you might just get whatever it is. Then what? The right or wrong people could unite in an explosive mix. It sounds like spectacular fun from the sidelines, but that doesn't always mean you want to be in the middle of it. Therefore, you should be extremely careful about who you touch today. It'll help to know something about chemistry, because certain elements remain highly unstable no matter how cool and composed they look. Don't experiment against your better judgment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
