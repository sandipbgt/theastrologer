    "horoscope": "Dreams, hopes and wishes. You live your life by these,. You want them to come true, and now you have a way in. Start living a life of wonder and imagination. Stop tuning out this amazing world where you live. Accept strange events that happen around you. Relish the feeling of getting caught up in them. You're standing at the gate of an intense, juicy opportunity to make yourself part of something bigger and different. So what are you waiting for? Grab that handle, pull it open, and let yourself in for whatever is coming to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
