    "horoscope": "If a situation arises today that requires courage, you're up to the task. Many times, it's hard for you to a stand or make a tough decision. You're often too concerned with others' needs and feelings to assert your own. But today your energy is high. You feel centered and brave. And if a tough situation develops, you'll know just how to handle it with grace and spunk.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
