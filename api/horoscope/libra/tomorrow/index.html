    "horoscope": "It's a great day for romance. Just try not to tip the balance too far toward yearning. Whether you're single or coupled, it's easy now to get caught up in fantasies of the 'perfect' mate or relationship -- though that doesn't exist except in your mind! Try to appreciate your partner or your life for what it is. That's true romance: falling in love all over again with what you already have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
