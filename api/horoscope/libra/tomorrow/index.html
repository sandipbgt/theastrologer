If you're in a professional setting, such as at work, a conference or a meeting with clients, you'll impress others with your sharp mind and quick thinking. Even among friends, your intellect shines, whether you're playing board games or just having a conversation. Your witty exchanges remind everyone why they like you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
