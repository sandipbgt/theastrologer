    "horoscope": "Let's be honest: You've led a bit of a charmed life. You know how to relate to people, and your natural creativity has served you well. But for today, you're even better than usual at winning friends and influencing people. You can  draw heavily on your natural communicative ability. Why? Among other things, you have excellent taste, and everyone knows it. Friends, clients and coworkers are coming to you, asking for your advice on their various projects and situations.
