    "horoscope": "You may feel less social today than you usually do. If so, there's no cause for concern. It's a good day to retreat from the world. Let yourself sleep in or take a nap, if you have time and you're so inclined. Read a book or do some reflective journal writing. Being quiet and sitting with your thoughts is a nice way to spend this subdued day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
