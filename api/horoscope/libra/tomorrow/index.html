Any group of people is bound to have some differences of opinion, and sparks are certainly created now as people discuss their views. But not all debates have to be filled with tension! Assume that people are just hashing things out in a friendly way, and they probably will be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
