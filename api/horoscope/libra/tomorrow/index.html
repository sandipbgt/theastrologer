Bouncing ideas around leads to wonderfully inspired brain waves. You could blast through an old problem or a new obstacle, and come up with something really unique. This applies whether you're at work, at home or just hanging out with friends. Whatever you're up to, have fun with the mental workout this day brings!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
