    "horoscope": "Your best qualities are shining today. You're witty, intelligent, attractive, and a natural diplomat. You should be proud of yourself! You're the kind of person others really like to be around, because you make them feel like they're the only thing that's important at that moment. All this good feeling makes business meetings go well, too. And it's a great day for socializing, since your warm energy is extra attractive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
