    "horoscope": "Think 'efficiency' in everything you do today. Economy of effort is important right now. That means keeping an eye on the bottom line as you work through your to-do list. Combine errands in one trip to save gas and time, or delegate certain tasks to your children, spouse or coworkers. This will help you stay focused on the things you know you can take care of on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
