    "horoscope": "Getting along with others is even more important to you today than usual. Thus, you're at your charming best, whether in a group or one on one. It's good to know instinctively how to get along with others, and cooperation is never a bad thing. Just make sure you don't give in on important decisions, when you should really take a stand. Remember, some things are worth fighting for.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
