You're all about balance, and that's the talent you should rely on now: keeping things fair and within the bounds of reason. Everywhere you go and everything you do, you're making improvements, whether you're conscious of doing so or not. This must be a measure of the passion you feel for the life you lead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
