Be glad you don't have to work so hard on appearances or fine tune the audio, just in case you were worrying. Turn your attention to more pressing matters. Start pushing back at whatever is closing in on you. The good news is that you're still a long way from being trapped. And if you start your push early enough, you'll have fun and get some exercise, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
