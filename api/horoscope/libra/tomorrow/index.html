    "horoscope": "It's easy to get a little clingy with your loved ones today. You're feeling a bit insecure, and you crave the comfort of familiar faces. Of course, if you're stuck on your own, you'll have to find a way to calm your own nerves. And no, that doesn't mean calling up every old friend in your address book! Today offers you a good opportunity to learn to rely on yourself when you're feeling emotional.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
