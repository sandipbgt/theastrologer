    "horoscope": "What's with you, anyway? One minute you're lonely and even a little needy, and the next, you're pushing away both close friends and well-meaning strangers. Which do you want -- the vulnerability of companionship, or the isolation of solitude? Maybe you aren't sure what you feel, much less what you need. Still, decide soon, so you can concentrate on getting it. Of course, if you stay confused and indecisive today, this mood will pass anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
