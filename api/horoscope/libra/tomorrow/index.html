    "horoscope": "You have a lot of love to give, today more than ever. You're warm toward friends and strangers alike, because you understand where they're coming from. This enables you to treat them with great empathy. Don't be surprised if you give out lots of hugs or caring advice under the current influence. Because of your core of strength, it's unlikely anyone will take advantage of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
