    "horoscope": "If some people seem insensitive today, don't take it personally. Many folks are simply feeling reserved now. Duties and responsibilities are weighing heavily on everyone's mind, even yours. Today's energy just isn't suited for lighthearted social gatherings. It's much more important to work hard and take care of business. That's where your focus should be. Take this opportunity to get a lot accomplished. Soon, the world will be playful again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
