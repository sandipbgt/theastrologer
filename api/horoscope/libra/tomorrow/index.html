If you're in a romantic relationship, this could potentially create a very exciting dynamic. However it could also cause trouble between you and your sweetie if your desires aren't aligned. Remember, it's all about balance. You have to give a little to get a little.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
