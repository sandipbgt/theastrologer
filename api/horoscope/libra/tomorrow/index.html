    "horoscope": "You're in acquisition mode today. You're picking up whatever isn't nailed down as you charge along the path of least resistance. Bringing a shopping list probably won't help. Hit up the flea markets, garage sales and clearance events instead. What you get will be totally unpredictable. And the best -- or worst -- thing is that it'll be all yours, so you'd better like it. You have to wonder why people are glad to let you have this stuff. In a karmic sense, all sales are final, at least this time around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
