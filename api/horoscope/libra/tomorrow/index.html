    "horoscope": "Spending time with family or loved ones brings you great pleasure today -- especially if you hang out with children. Kids help you get back in touch with your own playful, creative nature. They inspire you to dig your fingers and toes into the dirt, or to paint using your favorite colors without worrying whether they 'go together.' Lose yourself in adventure and experience today. And above all, have fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
