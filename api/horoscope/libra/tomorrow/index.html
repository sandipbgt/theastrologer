Resolve to stay cheerful and optimistic. Don't waste time worrying about what's going to happen in the coming weeks or months. Trust that the universe will bring you everything you need in order to grow, improve and be happy -- because it will!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
