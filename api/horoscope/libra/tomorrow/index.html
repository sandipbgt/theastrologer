    "horoscope": "On a normal day, you're the first one at the party, if not the host. You love being around other people. But isolation might seem a little more appealing now than usual, because you're in no mood for company. Don't worry about it. Take all the time you need. Being sociable is in your blood, so you'll be back amongst the crowd in no time. For now, let yourself unwind to feel more relaxed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
