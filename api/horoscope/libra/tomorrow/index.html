    "horoscope": "Normally you love being out and about, but today you might want to stay close to home. You're feeling more emotional than usual. Worries crowd your mind, and whether they're valid or unfounded doesn't matter. It's easy on days like this to turn to comfort foods to try to fill the emotional void. But there are much better ways to deal with it. Write, draw or talk as an outlet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
