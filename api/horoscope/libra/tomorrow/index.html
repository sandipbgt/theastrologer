    "horoscope": "You may be called on today to mediate a disagreement between friends or colleagues. You're perfectly equipped to handle this kind of responsibility now, because your sense of justice is firmly in place, but you're also tactful and kind. You have a great way of letting someone know they're in the wrong without making them feel bad. This is a real skill, Libra. Diplomacy is important. So is getting along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
