    "horoscope": "It wasn't a rendezvous with destiny, more like a blind date with possibility, but maybe you're a bit too prickly right now to keep that tentative appointment. It happens. Send your regrets and take the day off. If you miss that train, another one will be coming sooner or later. Meanwhile, take deep breaths to fill up your emptiness. Remember how to smile. You're not exactly dropping out of the race, but you do need to rehumanize yourself before going on. They'll all love you again once you're attitude- and illusion-free.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
