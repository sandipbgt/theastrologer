Be the moderator, mediator or go-between when other parties fail to understand each other, or refuse to even be in the same room. Sure, it's a community service for members who don't operate at your level, but you have your reasons for being so diplomatic. The right people will see those reasons and know what you're up to. And when that happens, you'll know you're getting somewhere.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
