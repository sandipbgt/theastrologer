    "horoscope": "Your friends and coworkers seem a little aloof today. You might prefer a warmer, more sociable atmosphere, but you're preoccupied with your own responsibilities, too. The current energy is just right for getting a lot accomplished, no matter how tedious or complicated the job might be. A methodical approach works best. It allows you to see any places where the process breaks down, so you can rework or revise, and move on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
