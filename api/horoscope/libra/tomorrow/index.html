    "horoscope": "Your closest connections with other people are highlighted today. You really want to get along with your spouse, best friend or business partner.

Do your best to find common ground, but try to embrace your differences, too. They're part of what makes you such a good team.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
