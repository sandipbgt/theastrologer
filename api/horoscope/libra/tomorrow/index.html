And if you are stuck at home or in the office, find ways to visit other places in a virtual sense, such as exploring a different culture on the Internet or chatting with a faraway friend via text or Instant Message. Even watching a film set in a different place or culture will stimulate your mind and your senses, and get your creativity flowing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
