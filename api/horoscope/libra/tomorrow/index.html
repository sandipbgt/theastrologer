    "horoscope": "You're rarely one to make waves. You want everyone to get along, and most days, you're willing to put your own needs second if that's what it takes to make that happen. But today, a bit of rebellion is welling up inside you. You're feeling energetic and intellectually tuned in, and personal freedom isn't just a nice concept -- it's a necessity. Claim your liberation! Just try not to burn any bridges in the process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
