    "horoscope": "Efficiency and economy matter today. Conserve your resources, including time, energy and money. If you've spent too much money lately, start now to put a savings plan into effect. And if you haven't spent enough time on work or organization, do so today. Get things in order at home or at the office. Throw out anything that isn't useful, including possessions, habits and systems. Clear the decks for a more organized life!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
