Today, combine cerebral understanding with an emotional perspective, and you'll gain an even deeper view into what it is to be human. Playing detective is fun now, too. Anything that's lost, you know you can find it. You may uncover more than you bargained for, but at least it'll be interesting!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
