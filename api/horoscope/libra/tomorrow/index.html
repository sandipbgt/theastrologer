    "horoscope": "It's a great day to get out into the world. Be social, or strike out on your own. Either way, court new experiences. Getting out of your usual routine or surroundings feels great. It's like a breath of fresh air moving through your life, making everything seem new and interesting! Your curiosity is tickled by anything foreign or exotic, so take a trip, try a new recipe or chat up a stranger.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
