    "horoscope": "You're looking out for everyone's best interests today. If a dispute comes up among your friends or coworkers, you can serve as the voice of reason. You're naturally attuned to fairness, after all, and you want everyone to get along. People respond to your kindness and your sense of humor. Soon, you'll have everyone laughing. But your presence brightens up any group. You may not even have to negotiate a dispute!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
