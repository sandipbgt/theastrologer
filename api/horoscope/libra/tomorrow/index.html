    "horoscope": "Today you're extra aware of others' needs and feelings. This is a gift for the folks who are touched by your compassion, but it can create problems for you. Tension is even less appealing than usual, which means right now you'll do whatever it takes to avoid conflict. But what if a situation arises in which you really need to put your foot down? Being kind but firm is an art, dear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
