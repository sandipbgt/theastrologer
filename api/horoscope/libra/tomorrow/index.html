    "horoscope": "A melancholy mood may set in today, but if so, it will be only briefly. The truth is, you might be too busy even to notice your moods. You have a lot on your plate, and the only way to get through it is by focusing on the end goal -- making measurable progress by evening. While you might prefer to get others' input or support, you may have to put your head down and go it alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
