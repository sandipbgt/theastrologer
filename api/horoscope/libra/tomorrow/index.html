    "horoscope": "Good little worker bees will finish outstanding projects today. But what if yours isn't 'outstanding'? That's just fine. As long as you've put your best effort into it, you know you can stand by your work, no matter what anyone else might have to say about it. Tap into your natural creativity, and your output will be even stronger. Best of all, you still like what you do, regardless of whether it's museum-quality. How many people can claim that? Most of us aren't nearly so self-accepting, and the fact that you are is a real gift.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
