    "horoscope": "Spend the day with someone you care about. Your friendships, partnerships and personal connections are very important to you, and it's a great day for letting the people you love know how you feel about them. Why not be creative about this? You can make a handmade, personalized card for someone, and write a poem or a heartfelt sentiment inside. The personal touch makes any gift that much more special.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
