    "horoscope": "You're a little indecisive by nature, and you accept that. But you don't want to be seen as spineless, do you? You're mopey and pessimistic, which is nothing like your usual, cheery self -- and friends and work mates are starting to notice. But spending the day alone isn't the answer. You don't need solitude -- you need to change your isolated ways, climb into the light and stand tall. Life is still swirling and sparkling around you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
