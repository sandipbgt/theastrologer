Even if you're chatting in a social setting with someone you've just met, you may find yourself asking probing, personal questions. With extreme tact, of course. It's all in your approach. And you're such a socially graceful person by nature, you'll find the right way to broach even the stickiest of subjects.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
