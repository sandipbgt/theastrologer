    "horoscope": "Welcome to a cloudy, emotional day -- even if it's sunny outside. The current influence is making many people more sensitive than usual. You might find yourself gravitating toward comfort foods or retail therapy. Hey, if it helps you feel more balanced, it's worth it, as long as you don't go overboard. Spending or eating too much are strong possibilities now, so watch out for them. Pamper yourself, but within reason.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
