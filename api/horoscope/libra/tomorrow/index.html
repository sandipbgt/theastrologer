This doesn't mean you shouldn't be flexible if you realize some part of your strategy isn't going to work. That's part of the current influence, too -- analyzing your progress as you go, so that you can recognize when it's time to revise your approach. This will help you reach success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
