Just enjoy being carefree and helpful around others,now that you have a sure thing in your own life. Accept this truth without bragging. Instead, start giving back to the world just because it feels like the right thing to do. Let today be your statement of how sincere and committed you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
