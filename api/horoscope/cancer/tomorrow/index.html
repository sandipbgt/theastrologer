    "horoscope": "Why all the waffling and hand wringing? Why are you so afraid to spend your capital? Simple decisions are like soap operas today. Each one seems to come with a supporting cast of lost souls and impossible situations. When you're not choking yourself with worry, you're killing other people with kindness. You know what? You need a vacation from all this, bigtime. Approach that simple decision as a way out. Choose something totally different, let it carry you away, and don't even look back on the mess you'll leave behind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
