    "horoscope": "You're feeling sentimental and in the mood for love today. An evening out with someone special is sure to rev your internal engine, but if you're single, even just going to see a romantic comedy with a buddy gets you in a good mood. Or staying home, lighting a candle and cooking a good meal, or watching the moonrise... There are plenty of good ways to invite romance into your life,. Of all the signs, you may know that best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
