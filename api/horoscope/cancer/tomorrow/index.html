    "horoscope": "Today, your social calendar might be full, whether you're in the mood for company or not. Do your best to stay energetic; it's important now to be alert to networking opportunities. If you need a few moments alone to recharge your internal batteries, take them, by all means. But after taking some deep breaths and resting your eyes, get back out there! Challenge yourself to smile even if your energy sags.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
