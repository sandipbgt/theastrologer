    "horoscope": "You tend to enjoy rich foods and other indulgences, and that urge for pampering increases today. Try out a complicated new recipe, especially if you use exotic or gourmet ingredients and invite some friends over for a taste test. If retail therapy is more your style, window shopping could turn into a full-on spree. If your budget or diet can't handle the strain, do your best to be moderate!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
