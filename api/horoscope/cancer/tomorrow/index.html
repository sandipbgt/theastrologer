It's more than okay now to try something new -- doing so is sure to lead to success. You have a gut feeling about what'll work, and don't be afraid to follow it. You'll surprise yourself and everyone else with the great things you can accomplish.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
