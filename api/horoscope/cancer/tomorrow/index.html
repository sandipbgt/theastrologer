    "horoscope": "Being outspoken is okay, but if you're overbearing about your opinions, well, maybe that's not so okay after all. And, that kind of controlling behavior is likely today. Maybe you're feeling out of control and compensating with rigid, conservative thinking? It's possible, especially if people start laughing at your attitude or demands. If so, try not to get your feelings hurt, though that's quite a tall order. Remember, that's just the price you pay for inflexible thinking and aggressive behavior.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
