    "horoscope": "You're used to going with your gut on important matters, so making decisions isn't usually a difficult process. But today, you can see all sides of an issue, and it's hard to choose just one. If you can live with the indecision for another day or two, you'll be able to gather more information and make a better choice. Otherwise, you could make a snap decision that you might regret later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
