    "horoscope": "Your social life may pick up today -- at least, the invitations might come pouring in. It's up to you whether you go or stay home. You might be tempted to skip the dinner party or happy hour, convincing yourself it's easier and more comfortable to stay home. But today it's a good idea to get some new energy flowing in your life. Get out of familiar surroundings. See new places and faces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
