    "horoscope": "Your loyalty to your bosses and colleagues has always been one of your best traits. Rely on it now to get you through the day. If you feel rebellious against someone's commands or expectations, remind yourself that compromise is key, for the present. If you can execute your duties faithfully today, you'll show everyone that you're worth taking seriously. And eventually, you'll have a bigger say in how things are run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
