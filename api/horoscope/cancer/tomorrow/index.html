There's nothing wrong with that, unless you suffer ill effects like an aching belly or an expanding waistline. Today is one of those days when you're in the mood to indulge, so go for low-density foods like sweet fruits, whole grains and nourishing vegetables.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
