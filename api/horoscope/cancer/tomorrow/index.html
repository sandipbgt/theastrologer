    "horoscope": "It's a good day to put hard effort into a project with a definite objective. It may take a lot of energy, for example, to work overtime at the office in order to gain a larger paycheck. But at least you know what you're working toward, and why. Throw yourself into something that helps you achieve your goals. It's a good time to save money or pursue professional advancement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
