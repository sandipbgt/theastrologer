    "horoscope": "You're generous with your time and affection today, and anything else you have to spare. This generosity stems not only from the feelings of contentment and confidence within you, but also from a bit of vulnerability that exists there, too. You want others' warmth and approval, so you're giving out your own, lavishly. That's the very definition of the Golden Rule,. You're treating other people as you hope they'll treat you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
