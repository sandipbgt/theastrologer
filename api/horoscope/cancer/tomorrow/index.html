    "horoscope": "You might feel moody today. But being this saturated in your emotions actually feels good. If you have any personal or relationship issues to work through, now is the perfect time. You know exactly where you stand, and you can read other people's feelings accurately, too. And processing emotions is cathartic. If you don't have anything of your own to work through today, help a friend with their issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
