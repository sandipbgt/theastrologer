You're tuned in to interesting facts and figures, so you might discuss the morning paper over breakfast with a friend, or chat via email about the latest online headlines. Ultimately, these tidbits may not be all that important; they could be the equivalent of a crossword puzzle -- little more than an interesting distraction. But at least you're engaged in the world around you. That counts for a lot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
