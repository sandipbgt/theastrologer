    "horoscope": "Your security needs are always strong, and today they're even more so. You may feel most comfortable in familiar surroundings, or with people you love and trust. In settings like this, you can relax and be yourself, which enables you to tend to others' needs more freely. But if you're in a new place or in the company of acquaintances or strangers, you may feel the urge to withdraw, whether literally or emotionally.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
