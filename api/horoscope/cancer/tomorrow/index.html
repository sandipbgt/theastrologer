    "horoscope": "It's a good day to treat yourself with gentle care. In the morning, do some gentle stretching or meditation. Eat well, and exchange hugs with your family or friends. Go to bed early tonight. These small things will help you stay emotionally and physically balanced all day long. It's also a great day to reflect on your feelings or your past. Reading old letters or writing in your journal gives you perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
