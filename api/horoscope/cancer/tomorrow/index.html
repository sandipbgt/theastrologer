The whole world is in a festive mood. Why don't you stop worrying and join them? Of course, if you're simply more comfortable focusing on your responsibilities, use your extra energy to get everything in order. Just don't judge anyone else for wanting to be out having fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
