    "horoscope": "Careful, steady progress is the name of your game today. Crossing your t's and dotting your i's brings you a satisfying sense of completion. Doing a job thoroughly -- even something mundane, such as folding the laundry or mowing the yard -- makes you feel calm and in control of your life. Then, you can stand back and admire the work you just did. After all, performing these small tasks makes life run smoothly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
