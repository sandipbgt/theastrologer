    "horoscope": "You feel saturated with feeling today, and with strong emotions often come self-indulgent tendencies like overeating or retail therapy. But neither of those things makes you feel better in the long run. If there's something you need to record in your journal or talk out with a trusted friend, do so today. You'll feel so much better when you begin to understand your own emotional depths.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
