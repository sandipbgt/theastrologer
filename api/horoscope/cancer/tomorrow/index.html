    "horoscope": "Today, a lighthearted, playful mood sets in. Staying home, especially alone, just doesn't appeal. You want to get out and greet the world. You'll probably find yourself chatting with strangers as you run errands, even if you're normally a shy type. And at work, you'll talk and laugh with your coworkers, which could easily get in the way of doing actual work! That's okay, though. Building interpersonal connections is important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
