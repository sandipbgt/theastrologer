    "horoscope": "Taking part today in a ritual or family tradition feels like soothing balm to your soul. Even simple ones, like eating dinner together, strengthen the bond you share with loved ones. Reading a story to your child before bedtime builds a sense of belonging with you. If you live alone, honor yourself by taking extra measures for your own comfort, such as good food, exercise and getting to bed early.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
