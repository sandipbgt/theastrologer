But today, ambition and accomplishment take on added importance. You want to impress your employer or take advantage of a career opportunity. Perhaps doing so is the right thing for your family, too. If you command a higher income, for example, it's easier to take care of loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
