    "horoscope": "There are times when you act very mature, but today you'll show youthful spirit. Of course, you may have the attention span to match, but this comes with the territory. You can't expect adult behavior from children. As long as you understand this, you'll be fine. Don't promise the impossible today when someone asks you a favor. Tell them the truth -- that you'll get back to them later. You'd hate to hurt anyone's feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
