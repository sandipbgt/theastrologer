    "horoscope": "Sympathy, empathy, lust -- today, you're swimming in the memories of cherished times long past. You've had an experience or two, haven't you? And all of it -- the feelings, the longings, the heartbreak, the excitement and more -- is stored in your mind and your heart. It's ready to be taken out, dusted off and relived every now and again. This is one of those moments when you're in the mood to remember past glories, and today, this may be all you need. But don't forget to keep your current relationships alive, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
