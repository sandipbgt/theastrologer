    "horoscope": "Today you're imbued with even greater emotional strength than usual. It's one of the things other people admire about you most. But it's most apparent on days like today, when you're compassionate, caring, sensitive and filled with strength, all at once. Helping others is easy when you feel so centered. Nurturing someone is as easy as cooking them a good meal, or giving them a hug.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
