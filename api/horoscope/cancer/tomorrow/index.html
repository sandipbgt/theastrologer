    "horoscope": "Today, you're very much in your element. You may feel saturated with emotion from the moment you wake up. Your dreams might be pregnant with feeling, too. Stories on the news or in the paper might bring up unexpectedly deep reactions. But this is actually a pleasurable experience for you -- living from this entirely subjective point of view. Your feelings and intuitions are the way you find and create meaning in life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
