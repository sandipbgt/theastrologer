    "horoscope": "You're in your element today. Your instincts are humming, and you're wise enough to pay attention to them. They might tip you off to a friend who's in need of some comforting, or a loved one who could use your particular brand of nurturing. And you feel strong and centered enough to provide this kind of support when it's needed. The universe favors selfless acts under the current influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
