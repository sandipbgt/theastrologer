If you practice any calming discipline like meditation or yoga, these will be especially handy under the current influence. Even if you feel as if it's impossible to channel your thoughts and your spirit, the mere attempt to do so will help in itself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
