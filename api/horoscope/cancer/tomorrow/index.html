The current energy has a way of putting people's strongest qualities on display, for better or worse. This goes for other people, too. You may notice your coworkers pushing for recognition in ways you consider unnecessary or even obnoxious. If you have children, their antics will make you laugh, but they could also wear you out!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
