    "horoscope": "You're keeping your cards close to your chest today, but in a good way -- the healthiest way. You know what you're worth, so you don't need to boast about your accomplishments or worry about your shortcomings. The best folks are already on your side, so you don't need to court further approval or affection. You're supported by loved ones and the universe itself, so you can relax and enjoy yourself,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
