    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic energy is subtle, but you're emotionally attuned enough to sense its effects. Your dreams might be more vivid, or they might affect you at a deeper emotional level than usual. In this state, it can be hard to distinguish between fantasy and reality! And yet, it's kind of fun when that veil thins between the 'real' world and the world of imagination. Perhaps you can find a creative way to use this influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
