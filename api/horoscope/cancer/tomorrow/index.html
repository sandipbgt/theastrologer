    "horoscope": "Change isn't really your thing, unless it's slow and gradual. You need plenty of warning when things in your life are shifting! But today things might take a sideways slide all on their own, and completely unexpectedly. If so, try to keep it in perspective. Most changes are improvements. Those that aren't are learning experiences at the very least. Keep a firm grip on your sense of humor!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
