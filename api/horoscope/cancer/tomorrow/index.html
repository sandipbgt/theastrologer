Today you'll probably switch back and forth between missions to avoid confrontation, get a better deal, or go with the hottest prospect. It's illogical in some ways and sane in others. Petty, material or animal concerns are hard to overcome. Maybe you should set your high ideals aside for now and come back to them when you're more focused.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
