    "horoscope": "It's easy to romanticize your relationships today, and overlook certain, very real problems within those relationships. It's natural to want to avoid conflict, but sometimes, that's not possible. In fact, intimacy relies on the ability to openly disagree with a partner. Your connection is strengthened by working through these obstacles. If you stay quiet when you should speak up, you're doing yourself a disservice, and you aren't being honest with the other person.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
