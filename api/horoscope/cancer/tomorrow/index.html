    "horoscope": "Your independent streak comes to the fore today. You probably won't take kindly to anyone telling you what to do! If you work in an office setting, it's a good idea to tackle jobs you can do solo. The same goes for any sort of group effort. Trying to mesh your own agenda with others' may be too difficult. On the other hand, it's a good way to develop your patience under pressure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
