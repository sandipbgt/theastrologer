    "horoscope": "Other people may see you as passive. But while you may be docile, you're certainly not devoid of feeling. In fact, you're more tuned in than usual to life's subtle vibrations. You have good reasons for letting someone else take charge today: For one thing, you're busy gathering your own inspiration and letting it settle into something more concrete in your mind. Soon, when your ideas have solidified into a real plan of action, you can take control once again. For now, enjoy the feelings and sensations that roll through your consciousness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
