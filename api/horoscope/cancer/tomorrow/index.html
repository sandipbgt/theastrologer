If you want things to feel smooth and positive again, all you have to do is be honest with everyone about your agenda -- including yourself . Give people a real reason to trust you. That's not so hard, is it? And you'll certainly feel better about yourself in the long run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
