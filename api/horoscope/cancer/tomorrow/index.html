    "horoscope": "You're in your element today, enjoying a day that's full of tradition, meaning and memories. The kitchen has a strong appeal now. Even the idea of cooking an international dish tonight goes over well, at least with the adults in the crowd. Expectations and familiarity are important, but it's also a good idea to try something new. Take advantage of this adventurous mood of yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
