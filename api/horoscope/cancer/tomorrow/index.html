Some would be rooted to the spot in fear, but you're standing fearlessly. Why? You're ordinarily somewhat shy of change, but this time around, you understand that you're in the middle of a brief, necessary waiting period. You have a few days to consider the finer points of your oncoming destiny, which is actually a comfort. It allows you to prepare yourself emotionally and decide how to approach it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
