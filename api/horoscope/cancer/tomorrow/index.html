After all, you aren't typically attracted to unusual people or ideas for the sake of strangeness itself. It takes you some time to become acclimated to new conditions of any kind. If sudden changes occur in some realm of your life today, do your best to trust that things will work out in the end.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
