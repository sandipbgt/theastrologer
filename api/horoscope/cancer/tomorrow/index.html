    "horoscope": "Today you're soothed by your daily routine or the procedure you use to complete a project. Systems that make logical sense bring you a feeling of security. Your practical eye for detail is enhanced now, which comes in handy in spotting issues as they occur and correcting them as you go along. If anyone is tracking your progress -- such as your employer, if you're up for review -- they're sure to be favorably impressed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
