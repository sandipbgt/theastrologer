    "horoscope": "When negative criticism comes your way today, you'll deal with it by tossing some stinging comebacks. The only problem is, what you're perceiving as negative might actually be constructive and well-intended. You've always been a bit on the sensitive side, and right now your skin is even thinner than usual. Chill out. Remember that your own anger could leave wounds on your friends, loved ones and coworkers -- anyone who happens to get in your way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
