    "horoscope": "If you're truthful with yourself, you'll realize that any arrogance or contempt you may be showing right now is really just a facade to hide deeper fears, ones you may not even admit to yourself. Sure, you could live with this for the time being, but why not resolve these issues before they get any worse? Being honest with yourself and the people who are close to you brings the intimacy and understanding you crave.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
