    "horoscope": "Your sensitive nature flares up today, and you probably won't deal with it gracefully. Instead, you might give hotheaded responses and put your foot in your mouth. It feels like there's a gap between you and someone important, and this makes you nervous. But you're only widening it by lashing out. Try to calm yourself,, and explain your feelings to someone you trust. You'll only end up getting sick if you try to bottle them up or express them in unhealthy ways.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
