    "horoscope": "A reserved, cautious mood sets in today. You may feel weighed down by your responsibilities, and in no mood to be sociable. If you're worried about career or financial issues, focus on improving these areas of your life. Think in practical terms. Make solid plans for the future. Set up a budget or a schedule, if you need to. This kind of project can only increase your confidence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
