    "horoscope": "You're in your element today. You're steeped in emotions that wash quietly through you like a deep river. You may have a realization that changes everything -- your feelings, your self-perception, even your focus. Or, you may help a friend through a similar transformation. The current energy is the kind that uproots deep feelings and exposes them to light. This process can be painful, but it can also be incredibly freeing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
