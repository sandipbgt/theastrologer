But being a little bit adventurous will take you far. Consider the realm of your own thoughts: Stretching your idea of what's normal, acceptable or true opens up a whole new world. At the very least, it's fun to play around with ideas and see what develops!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
