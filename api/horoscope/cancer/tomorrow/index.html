    "horoscope": "Focus today on smooth interactions with your spouse or business partner, or anyone with whom you work closely. A cooperative bond is even more important now than usual. Of course it isn't a good idea to set harmony above all other concerns, if a critical issue arises. But whenever possible, choose your battles. Place a premium on getting along. Bend over backward, if you have to, to keep the peace.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
