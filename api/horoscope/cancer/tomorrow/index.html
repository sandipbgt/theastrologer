    "horoscope": "All these nervous, resentful feelings you're experiencing could start wearing you down if you don't release them. If their source is something ongoing that you can't escape -- like the day job -- maybe it's time for a break. Can you get out of town anytime soon? Take a short road trip, or get yourself to the nearest beach and chill out. Even an afternoon of antiquing or wine tasting in a nearby town would help you unwind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
