    "horoscope": "A certain peacefulness has descended on you today. You patiently tend to your work, your projects and your relationships. You'd like more time to do things the old-fashioned way. You're more connected to your traditional values than usual. So live by them. Forget about efficiency, no matter what your employer or colleagues might tell you. It's not about maximum output; it's about doing things carefully and right. Sometimes, craftsmanship is more important than the bottom line. This is one of those times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
