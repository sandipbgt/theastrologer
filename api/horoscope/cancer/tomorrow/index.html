    "horoscope": "It could be a short, straight line from imagination to accomplishment. If you're sure of yourself, you'll make it in record time. Keep a watchful eye on friends, strangers, the flow of traffic, the sweep of the weather, or anything that might give you helpful clues or influence your next step. Forget the usual model of stimulus and response. Let your own responses stimulate you. But instead of being a closed loop, today can be an upward spiral. Just don't let that creative image distract you from the reality of your short, straight line.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
