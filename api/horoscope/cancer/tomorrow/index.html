    "horoscope": "There's a fine balance between being thorough in your work and being a perfectionist, but you should have no trouble striking that balance today. You have a natural sense of what's important and what isn't, which helps you pay attention to all the right details. You can also make sure you don't waste time, energy, money or other resources, simply by keeping an eye on the clock or the bottom line.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
