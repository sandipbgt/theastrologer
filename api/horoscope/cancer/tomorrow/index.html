    "horoscope": "It's a good day to put your feelings into words. Even complex emotions find expression now, because it's so much easier than usual to describe abstract images or complicated situations. This makes it a great day to write in your journal, talk with a friend, or visit your therapist. Self-analysis is great now because you won't let yourself get too bogged down in feeling. You'll simply think, talk and process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
