    "horoscope": "Today you're even better than usual at making other people feel at home. Why? Because their comfort genuinely matters to you. Plus helping them feel more comfortable puts you right where you want to be: moving toward your own goals. No, this isn't manipulative, it's practical. You need your friends and associates, and they need you. It's a 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' situation, and there's nothing wrong with that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
