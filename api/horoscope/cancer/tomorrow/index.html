Then examine them casually, checking them out from the corner of your eye as they answer your polite questions. You'll have today to collect most of the information you need. In that time, you might also be able to resolve certain problems without applying a lot of pressure. See what a little strategy and diplomacy can do? It's hard to get much cooler.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
