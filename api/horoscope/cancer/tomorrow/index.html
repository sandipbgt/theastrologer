It's great to care about so many and cut them a lot of slack. It's not so great to know someone so well that you can only see them through the filter of a troubled relationship. All that infighting could distract you from your real purpose. If you need to be clear on this, maybe you need to be alone for a while.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
