    "horoscope": "Don't pressure yourself to outperform your colleagues or to shine in a new relationship. You don't need to be 'on' today. Give yourself time for self-awareness and self-discovery. Take it at an easy pace. If you feel you're wandering through the world in a subjective dream, you're on the right path. Use your imagination to arrive at new discoveries about your life. Above all, today should be about staying comfortable. For now, nothing can hurt you. Take comfort in that fact and float for a bit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
