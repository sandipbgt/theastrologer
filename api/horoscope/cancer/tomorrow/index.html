    "horoscope": "Get some humor in your life ASAP. Crack a smile, bust a move, and start those happy emotions flowing. It could be a geyser, which would be OK with you. The more good stuff you have going on, the easier it'll be to ignore the bad stuff that's still following you around. Irritation will dog your steps today, begging for attention. Don't feed it a single scrap. Boredom will circle you like a vulture. Admire the pretty shadows it makes on the ground, but don't look up and don't stop moving. You can't let these things prey on you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
