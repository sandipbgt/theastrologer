Or maybe you're simply encountering ways of thinking and living that run counter to what you're accustomed to. Try to keep your chin up and stay observant, even if you wish you could just turn tail and run home. Being exposed to new things keeps you flexible!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
