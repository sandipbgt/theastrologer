    "horoscope": "You're more self-assured today than usual, which makes you bolder when dealing with other people. Sticky situations are unlikely today, but if one happens to arise, you'll be brave and kind at the same time. If you're compassionate with others, you can give a little ground even as you represent your own needs. This makes you a hero in anyone's eyes. And it feels good to know you're so graceful under pressure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
