    "horoscope": "It's a great day to pay attention to your health. This might mean taking a walk, hitting the gym or shopping for healthy, nutritious foods to stock your fridge. This also applies to mental health. Doing a good, deep clean on your house can translate to a sort of psychic clearing that makes you feel a lot more optimistic and energetic! Plus, it's nice to have a fresh, organized space in which to relax.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
