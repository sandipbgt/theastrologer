You feel equipped to handle whatever might be on your agenda for the day, even if you have many tedious to-dos ahead of you. You'll work in a steady, practical manner, proceeding step by step until you've finished what you set out to do. That measured approach works well now, and it affords you a real sense of accomplishment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
