    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic emphasis is on tolerance. But keeping an open mind might be a tall order if the very foundations of your personal philosophy are challenged. And that's just the kind of thing that happens under the current influence. Try not to let fear of the unknown -- unfamiliar ideas, people or paths -- make you withdraw into your self-protective shell. Keep a bold and seeking attitude as you purposely challenge your own assumptions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
