    "horoscope": "Emotionally, you're in a pleasant state of balance today, so your mood is smooth. People find you more easygoing than usual, which makes you feel good. In return, you can sense their warmth and appreciation. Even working long hours is okay, because you have the energy for it. Still, be sure to take periodic breaks to call home and connect with your family. It's important to balance the two sides.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
