But before getting cross with someone, remind yourself that you want to be loving toward your friends. You don't appreciate it when they take issue with every little thing you say and do, so don't do that to them. Work on increasing your patience, so that everyone will be happier -- including you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
