    "horoscope": "You're an independent thinker. Now, you may be more so than ever. You know what's meaningful to you, and you're excited to pursue your goals. This could mean, of course, that for today you'll be emotionally reserved around others. Sometimes, you need to withdraw while you work something out, or just tend to your business. Anyone who's upset at your absence will love you all the more when you're ready to return.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
