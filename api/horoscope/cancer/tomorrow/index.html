    "horoscope": "You'll defend what you believe in, although a good friend might point out that what you believe in seems to change with the seasons. But listen, if it matters to you, it's worth doing, right? Hey, you might even give up a few of your luxuries for a day or so. Is this the decisive moment or just another step? It's probably too soon to tell, although here's a test. How public is your little sacrifice? You won't need media coverage if it's the real deal. Quiet determination happens whether or not anybody else is there with a camera.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
