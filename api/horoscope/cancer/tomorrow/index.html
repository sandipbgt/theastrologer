    "horoscope": "You feel unusually bold today. Maybe it's just something in the, but you're playing the role of devil's advocate, taking a position you may or may not hold on a personal level. If you find yourself arguing the same point over and over, you'll have to get past it, or the conversation will become a closed, boring loop. Agreement frees everyone up to move on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
