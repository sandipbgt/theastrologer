    "horoscope": "Ever see a dog roll over on its back and gaze up at you with those sweet, sad eyes? On some level, you might be that dog, and it might not be so cute. If you let things go too far, today could be a mess of pathetic begging. You really do want someone's love, money or recognition. Yes, these are all powerful motivators, but don't do anything too dramatic for them. Dignity matters more than you realize. Stand up and walk away from any situation that would bring you this low. You're worth way more than that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
