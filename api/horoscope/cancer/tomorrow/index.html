You're sensitive to energy fluctuations, so if you start feeling irritable, it probably means you need some time alone. Of course, your racing thoughts could prevent you from taking a nap. Do your best to stay calm and even-tempered. After every few calls, emails or conversations, take a few moments just to breathe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
