    "horoscope": "Emotional stability is yours today, if you want it. A sense of inner peace is wonderfully grounding now. Since you're so centered on the inside, it's easy to deal with outside issues in a calm, levelheaded way. And best of all, the people around you will be soothed by your obvious composure. You can set a good example for your family members or coworkers, who may not be feeling as relaxed as you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
