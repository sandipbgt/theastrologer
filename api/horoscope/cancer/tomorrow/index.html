    "horoscope": "You're OK with the sound of your own voice. It's those other loudmouths who irritate you. Somewhere in the rules it says that only you get to speak up today. You're so weighed down with words that letting them out under these circumstances will seem reasonable. Well, everyone gets to have their opinion. But opinions won't count for much if you're running old software or operating on an outdated model. So think twice before you go around pulling the plug on others. Would you pack it in and go home if somebody told you to? Of course not.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
