    "horoscope": "Life feels frenzied at the moment. You're at the center of it all, trying to keep your head up and your feet planted. Could you be creating some of the chaos yourself? That's likely. It's also possible that you're gripping too tightly. Whatever it is you're grasping, either you're destined to let it go, or you couldn't lose it in the first place. It's a good thing this energy will pass soon. If it went on any longer, it might start affecting your health.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
