    "horoscope": "Put your feelings into words today, whether by talking them out with a trusted confidant or by writing them down in a letter or your journal. The only trouble is, it's hard to figure out exactly what you're feeling! That's not really a problem, though, even if it makes you uncomfortable. It's okay to have conflicting emotions about a certain person or situation. Just get them into words, so you can inspect them later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
