You're feeling relaxed and easygoing enough to let someone else choose the game. You might even accept the role of second best, and let them win. This is just a measure of your ego, or lack thereof. You don't need to dominate; you just need to connect in a genuine, heartfelt way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
