It's best to set your feelings aside, and take a more logical view of things. There's work to be done, and in some situations, sentimentality or obligation can only hold you back. That's when it's most important to think like a scientist. Observe, weigh options, and then act.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
