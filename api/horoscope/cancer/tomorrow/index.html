You may sense that you're going to have to step in and be the one who keeps things grounded and sane, because the people around you may seem a little flakey. But there's a difference between recklessness and blowing off steam. Cut others some slack. In fact, why not have a little fun yourself? Remember this motto: 'Life is uncertain -- eat dessert first!'(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
