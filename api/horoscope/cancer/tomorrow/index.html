    "horoscope": "Restless energy besets you today, which isn't comfortable for a person as routine-oriented as you are. On the other hand, maybe you can make something of this. Go out in the morning and do your shopping, exercise or work. Take care of business. But in the evening, cuddle up at home with a good book or a movie and some popcorn. Take some private time.
