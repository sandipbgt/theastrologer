Many people are feeling emotionally vulnerable at the moment. They'll appreciate your kindness and authenticity. Don't be surprised if you end up in a position to give someone advice or support! That's what happens when you're strong and soft at the same time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
