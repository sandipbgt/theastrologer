    "horoscope": "Conflict and disharmony are two of your least favorite things, but you may have to face them today. If so, stay calm and focus on forgiveness, instead of unleashing criticisms and hurt feelings. Your instinct might be simply to run from these issues and hide in the comfort of your own home. This could work, unless the conflict is with someone in your family. Try to take a balanced view and talk it out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
