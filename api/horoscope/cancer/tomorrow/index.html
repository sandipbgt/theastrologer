There's power in knowledge, but since you don't know everything yet, there will also be some limits to your power. Today you'll speak with authority and economy, or at least you will if you're trying not to highlight your weaknesses. But throughout this internal struggle, try to show your humanity once in a while, too. After all, you're famous for your sensitive side. People care more about what you feel than what you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
