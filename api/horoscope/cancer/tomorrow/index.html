    "horoscope": "You've always had a special connection with the past and taken the teachings of tradition to heart. The old ways still impress sentimental you, especially now, as past lessons come back to you. Now, more than ever, you understand why you live by the values and routines you do. In some meaningful way, things you've always taken for granted now come true, and you're able to wow everyone with all the things they've forgotten in their own lives and hearts. Later, it'll be on to something new again, including testing the boundaries.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
