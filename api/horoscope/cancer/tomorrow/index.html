To use another animal kingdom metaphor, waspish outbursts will invite stinging retorts today. But either way, quiet or noisy, reexamine your behavior. Leave the building if you can't stand the people, but try giving them the benefit of the doubt one last time. They might actually surprise you with their kindness, humor and intelligence. Then you could lose the attitude.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
