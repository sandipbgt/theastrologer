    "horoscope": "You're attuned to life today at a deeply feeling level. Every emotion is deeper than usual -- and that's saying something, since you're emotional by nature! Bittersweet memories tug at your heartstrings; heartwarming moments may have you blinking back tears. You might be swamped with a sense of gratitude for the blessings and experiences that life has brought your way. Revel in these feelings. Absorb them and let them enrich the person you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
