    "horoscope": "A burst of passion infuses you today. This should make things interesting! Have fun, but watch out for the pitfalls that tend to go along with this influence. For one thing, keep a rein on your temper. Your emotions are right at the surface, so it's a little too easy to jump to conclusions and overreact. On a more positive note, enjoy the sense of initiative that boosts you along your path.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
