That's smart thinking, since right now, reckless acts aren't favored. Use your strong instincts to help you calculate risks and determine whether or not they're likely to pay off. You can also give good advice to someone whose common sense isn't quite as well honed as yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
