    "horoscope": "Secure relationships have always been a priority for you. Today, you might have to choose between harmony and fairness. And this will be a tough choice, because while you prize closeness and peace, you also resent imbalances in your relationships. Find a way to preserve the harmony between you and another, even as you find a resolution that benefits you both. It's called compromise, dear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
