    "horoscope": "At the moment, your heart and mind are quietly untroubled. Today you're as peaceful as a dove and helpful as a child, which means you're content to let others run the show. You have no problem taking direction from someone else, as long as their heart is in the right place. You're demonstrating the power of acquiescence now. This doesn't mean that you've given up control to someone else, though. It's just  that passive control can be so much easier. Not to mention more effective!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
