    "horoscope": "Devote yourself today to creating a secure future for yourself and your loved ones. Whether that means putting money in the bank, cleaning your home or office, or taking care of business and personal relationships, you're all over it. If outer circumstances don't force you to take charge of these matters, your 'inner parent' will. There's just no escaping the sense of duty and devotion today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
