    "horoscope": "Today you're in the mood for powerful experiences. It's a great day to spend time with someone you love. Trust is an important requirement for this connection, too. You need to know that it's safe to share your deepest needs and passions. And of course you're ready and willing to return that trust. You're quite devoted to your loved ones, and that devotion only deepens under the current influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
