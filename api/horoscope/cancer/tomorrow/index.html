    "horoscope": "You're finding fault with yourself and everyone else today, and it isn't fun for anyone. Where is this grumpy mood coming from? Inspect your feelings. You'll probably find that you're worried about something, and insecurity is pushing you to criticize everyone -- including yourself. But you're a nurturing, compassionate person by nature, so you'll realize quickly that a softer, gentler approach will go much further toward soothing any anxieties you may have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
