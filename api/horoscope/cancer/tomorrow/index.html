    "horoscope": "You're feeling mellow and self-indulgent today. If it's cold outside, bake something sweet and delicious. In general, being at home is a pleasure now, because all you feel like doing is relaxing in the place where you're most comfortable. But if you have to go to work, you're capable of long hours of sustained effort -- which makes that big dinner with your loved ones that much more enjoyable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
