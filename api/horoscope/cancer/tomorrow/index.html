You're a nurturing, compassionate person, but if you sense someone is wasting your time or taking advantage of your kindness, you can get pretty worked up about it. If that kind of situation develops today, it will only be compounded by the fact that most people, including you, are reacting more quickly than usual to perceived slights. If you feel upset, do your best to mediate your response.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
