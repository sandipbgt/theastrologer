    "horoscope": "There's a compelling pattern at work here, like a dance, or a game. And you know the moves and strategies by instinct, putting you ahead of the rest. Isn't it fun, being enticed into someone's game, or teasing and luring them into yours? It's enough to make you shiver with anticipation at what could become of this delicious, simmering energy. Yes, this is a heady, sexy time. And best of all, there are no losers.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
