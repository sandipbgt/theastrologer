Get lost in its mystery today -- to ponder the big questions as well as the small ones. Use your strong intuition to decide what feels right and what doesn't. Don't be surprised, though, if you don't come up with anything concrete. It might just be that the solution isn't yours to find, and these mysteries will remain mysteries for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
