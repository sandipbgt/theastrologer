    "horoscope": "Your strength lies in your unflinching emotional courage. And today, you're quite courageous, in a quiet, personal and steadfast way. Whatever feelings well up now, you're ready to experience them. If an issue arises with a friend or family member, you want to work it out. Even if this means inspecting your own behavior and motivations, you aren't afraid. You're willing to change something about yourself if it will help you build stronger relationships.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
