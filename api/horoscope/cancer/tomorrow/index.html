    "horoscope": "Today it's all about abilities and skills. Take what you were born with, mix it with some of the stuff you've learned since then, and see what happens when you shake it up. Could get a little messy, don't you think? If you're not really up for radical results, keep it within a predictable range. Don't worry about not being good enough to meet other people's expectations. You deserve applause and compensation no matter what you do. It's your show and your song, so let them sing harmony to your melody.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
