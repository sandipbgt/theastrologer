You're too cautious for that, and now the universe has you feeling extra nervous about anything that seems unpredictable. And yet, things probably aren't so dire as all that. You're a hard worker, and a smart one; you've done your part to create a stable, sustainable life for yourself and your loved ones. Trust the universe to provide the rest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
