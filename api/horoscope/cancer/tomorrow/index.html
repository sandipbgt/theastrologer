    "horoscope": "Well, look at you. The old nurturing reflex kicked in when you weren't paying attention, and now you're back in caretaking mode. Wandering through this state of dreamy acceptance, you give what you have, they all say thank you, and everyone's happy. In reality, you could be forcing your generosity on those who don't want it. Don't do that because you aren't that way. Instead of treading down the same old paths, make some conscious decisions about how to spread your energy today. Use your potential where it will do the most good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
