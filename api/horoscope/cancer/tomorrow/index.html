    "horoscope": "You want financial security and comfort, but you can't be all things to all people. If you try, you'll run yourself ragged, and then no one will be happy. Calm down, and try not to smother people so much -- just focus on your own needs for a while. You'll get a lot accomplished today if you trust that things will happen. Soon you'll feel more cooperative and compromising, with a clearer view of the goals you share with others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
