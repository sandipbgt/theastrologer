    "horoscope": "You're feeling a bit vulnerable, as if you're emerging from your dim, comfortable home into bright, blaring sunlight. Just as your eyes mightand sting in that moment, they could well up today, too. It's hard to keep your emotions in check around certain people -- those whose vanity has hurt you in the past. Don't let that happen today. Avoiding these people is best for now. Stick to taking care of your own business.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
