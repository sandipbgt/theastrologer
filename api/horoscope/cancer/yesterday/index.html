Your ideas and goals are certainly excellent, and they could use some support from the group. So work on merging with the rhythm of your surroundings today. Blend in perfectly. Do what you need to do to cultivate the assistance and approval of your friends or your work-mates.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
