    "horoscope": "Set aside this day to deal with the people you often take for granted. Go out of your way for family, friends and other members of your tribe. Open your home to visitors, even if you've fallen behind in your housekeeping. Share your bounty with those who clearly deserve it. And if you let all this giving become second nature during the next month, you may find it easier to get along with people in general. Even if you don't owe them, you can probably spare something extra. The world could always use a little more good will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
