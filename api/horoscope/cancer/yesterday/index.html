Plus helping them feel more comfortable puts you right where you want to be: moving toward your own goals. No, this isn't manipulative, it's practical. You need your friends and associates, and they need you. It's a 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' situation, and there's nothing wrong with that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
