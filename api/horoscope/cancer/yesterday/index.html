    "horoscope": "People have always loved you for who you really are, but that's true today more than ever, because it's so apparent how genuine you are. Everyone you come across is struck by your warmth, openness, and approachability. Your strong, positive energy helps you communicate in a straightforward way. You're helpful, kind, and sincere all at once. If you need to have a serious talk with someone, today would be a good time to do it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
