    "horoscope": "Your emotions are strong today. It's a great day for one-on-one time with your sweetie or your best friend -- someone you trust,  and who knows you thoroughly. If you're on your own, try some private self-reflection. Writing in a journal soothes your soul. Sifting through old letters or photographs may bring up bittersweet emotions, but the memories also remind you of how far you've come.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
