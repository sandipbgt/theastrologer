    "horoscope": "There's a good chance you're imposing your own point of view on your partner today. You might think you see their side of things, but you're just seeing what you want to see -- which helps no one. Whatever you're pushing for, try setting it on the back burner for now, so you can make a sincere effort to connect with your partner's true needs or feelings. This shouldn't be too difficult, since you're empathetic and connected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
