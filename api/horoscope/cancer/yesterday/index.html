You should know all about this. Maybe you already live or work with these people. Maybe you used to be like that yourself. That doesn't mean everyone else will be on board with you. Be aware of consequences today. And if you've already set something in motion that you can't stop, take a deep breath and then take responsibility.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
