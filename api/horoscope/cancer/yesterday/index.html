    "horoscope": "Focus today on making your home attractive, comfortable and balanced. That might mean clearing up clutter or hanging a new print on the wall. It might also mean resolving an issue with your sweetheart or house mate that's been making things tense between you. If you do have to talk out a problem today, do so in the spirit of compromise. Negotiate something you both can live with.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
