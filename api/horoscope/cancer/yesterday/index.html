    "horoscope": "Congratulations, maybe. You just left your timid, indecisive self behind. Today you'll feel self-important about your goals, and you might look down on anyone who doesn't share your high hopes. You'll demand action instead of more excuses or reports. You'll probably get plenty of all three, but that's OK. That's how it is near the top of the food chain. This burst of result-driven energy may render you tightfisted with your budget. You'd like to save something, but you can't expect everyone else to pay out of pocket. The buck stops here.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
