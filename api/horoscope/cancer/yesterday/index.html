But today, your tongue and mind are fluid, and you know just how to put things. You're forging new metaphors. Remember, it's all contained within the literature. Your writing won't affect right away. Maybe that's a good thing. It could really free up your muse if you know you won't be graded or judged till later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
