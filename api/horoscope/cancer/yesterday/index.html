    "horoscope": "Your connections with other people may feel a bit awkward today. Perhaps you're looking for warmth, but all you're getting is a chilly reception. If so, don't take it personally. People are in taking-care-of-business mode. If they seem detached, it's only because their minds are someplace else. In truth, you're probably preoccupied with your own projects and causes. Life will warm up soon, don't worry.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
