    "horoscope": "Communication takes center stage today. Self-expression can sometimes be tricky for you. It's hard to put your deepest feelings into words. It's easier at the moment, since abstract emotions and images are more readily translated. If you have to address a sticky situation with a friend or coworker, a wry, dry sense of humor will help. Making a joke at your own expense softens up the other side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
