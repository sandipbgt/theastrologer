    "horoscope": "You're a private person, one who doesn't let others in very easily. Today, though, you may be feeling even more secretive and private than usual. This is no problem, especially since no feeling lasts forever. By tomorrow, a festive spirit will grip you in all its fervor and excitement. So enjoy your cocoon today,, but be prepared to emerge soon as a butterfly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
