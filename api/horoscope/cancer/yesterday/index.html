    "horoscope": "You're in a good position today to counsel someone regarding their feelings or problems. If you work as a counselor or therapist, you may have many more clients than usual! If not, your children or friends might come to you, in need of advice. They know you're kind, reliable and honest -- an important combination. You'll give it to them straight, but gently. That's just the approach these sensitive types need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
