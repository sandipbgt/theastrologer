For one thing, you can disconnect, gently but firmly, from anything or anyone that irritates you. This will help you concentrate on more positive things. Get together with a supportive friend who can lend a sympathetic ear as you unload about your troubles. Don't focus too closely on your problems.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
