    "horoscope": "You're always emotionally sensitive, but today this side of you receives a boost from the cosmos. You're extra aware of the people around you, at a deep level. You can sense their needs and feelings. It's easier to read people in this heightened state of awareness. But it's also as if your personal boundaries are thinner than usual. It's hard not to take on others' feelings as your own! Protect yourself,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
