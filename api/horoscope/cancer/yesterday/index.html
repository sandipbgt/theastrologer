    "horoscope": "Listen to your gut -- it's aiming you in the right direction. You're working even more efficiently than usual, which gives you structure. Is there anything you can't get done? Even if you're a rock star at work and home alike, don't get too cocky., listen closely when your coworkers or family try to tell you what they think. Your intuition is naturally strong, but you're currently more attuned to your own goals. But if you work hard and stay humble, an actual purpose will unfold. And you'll appreciate knowing what it is.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
