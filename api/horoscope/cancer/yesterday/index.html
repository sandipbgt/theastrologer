But try not to tense up when someone doesn't fulfill your expectations. Perhaps they're working at their own pace, or going in a different direction than you'd anticipated. Sometimes, change and ingenuity are a good thing. Give it a chance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
