    "horoscope": "You feel more emotionally grounded than usual. In fact, you're rooted in your physical self, which is highly comforting. You possess a great deal of physical strength that complements your emotional stamina, and today you have both readily available. Whatever comes your way, have confidence that you can handle it. You'll probably end up helping others as well as taking care of your own responsibilities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
