For once, you know exactly what you're feeling and why. Enjoy this, but remember that a few days of it could put you off your game. This may seem contradictory, but it's true. Even as you're enjoying this mood, you need to be aware of the real world outside your door, which will come knocking soon enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
