    "horoscope": "Feelings intensify today, as the current influence deepens emotions and brings life to a highly subjective plane. Some people may have trouble with this, but you actually enjoy it. Feeling your way through a relationship, a problem or anything else is your strong point. It's how you operate on a normal basis. Now your intuition and compassion are even stronger than usual, which makes them especially effective as tools of navigation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
