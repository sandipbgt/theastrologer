    "horoscope": "Important projects and problems merit your business face today. Work, relationships or other responsibilities might demand your focused attention. Whatever's on your plate, don't pull a disappearing act. Instead, tackle it head-on with both energy and commitment. It's a good idea to gather your assets, too; you may need every ally and bit of strength you can find. Emotional transparency won't be too helpful, so keep your feelings close to your chest. You can let them out later, in private, to someone special.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
