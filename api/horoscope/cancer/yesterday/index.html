    "horoscope": "Is that you peeking out from behind the curtains, eager to see, worried about being seen? Don't be so shy. Don't put yourself down, sweep your accomplishments under the rug or put others ahead of you. Even your basic skills are truly awesome. Others would give a lot to have what you have. So start taking full responsibility for your life. Start showing some pride in what's uniquely yours. And one more thing -- own your work ASAP. People need to know all the cool stuff you can do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
