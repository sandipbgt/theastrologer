    "horoscope": "A restless day is upon you. You're irritable and ready to engage in anything that looks like a potential argument. Try not to be so snippety with people who mean well. Just think about the messes you'll have to clean up later! You hate hurting people's feelings, so avoid that slippery slope. Don't let your emotions be in charge today. Use your head, and talk some sense into yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
