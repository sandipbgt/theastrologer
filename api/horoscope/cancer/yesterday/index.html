    "horoscope": "You may feel-logged with emotion today, but you don't have to turn passive and moody. Instead, tap into the power of your own feelings. Your emotional side makes you strong, after all. It's who you are, at your core: your caring, generous, family-oriented self. If you connect with your feelings now, you'll know which areas of your life need strengthening or attention. This knowledge can guide you for the next few weeks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
