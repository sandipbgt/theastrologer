Your professional associates and loved ones also find you reliable. Your presence alone helps them feel more secure, because they know you're trustworthy. You may have to fill in gaps left by someone else, but this shouldn't be a problem. You can do twice the work in half the time!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
