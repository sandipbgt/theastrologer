The only problem is, lots of other people want to be in charge right now, too! Instead of getting into a battle of wills, see if you can negotiate a cooperative effort. Or, simply work on your own. Independent efforts may fare best, for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
