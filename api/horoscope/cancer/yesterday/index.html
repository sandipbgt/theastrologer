    "horoscope": "Your deepest feelings are stirred up today. Fortunately, you're no stranger to deep emotions, and you know how to handle them. If you're in a stable relationship with a romantic partner, so much the better, but your connection with your best friend or a beloved family member is important now, too. It's good to talk out your feelings with someone you love and trust. Make that intimate connection today,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
