Some people, under the current energy, open themselves up to those who would take advantage of their kindness. But that shouldn't be an issue for you. You're able to show your soft side to those who deserve it, and your strength to those who need it most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
