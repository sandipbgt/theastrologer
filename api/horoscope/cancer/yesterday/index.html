You're silent about your data because certain people might use it against you. Is any of this really true? Who knows? But it would be OK to withdraw for a day while you work on this puzzle. Just be aware of any friction you might cause on the way out. That could be the first thing you'd have to deal with once it's time to come back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
