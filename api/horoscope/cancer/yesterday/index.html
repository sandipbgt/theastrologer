    "horoscope": "You might feel moody today, and it could be hard to find a close friend to help you talk it through. Having to bottle everything up inside only makes your feelings more intense. But your focus is strong now, so losing yourself in work is a good idea until you're able to get your feelings off your chest. Then, it's time to chat, text or phone that friend of yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
