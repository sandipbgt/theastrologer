    "horoscope": "You're something of a quiet visionary now. It's a good thing you're feeling centered and modest, so there's no need to boast about your realizations, intelligence or accomplishments. This humble attitude is sure to impress people, including someone who can help you move forward on a project or toward some other goal. If they're not quite as clued-in as you are, maybe you can explain things to them as you go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
