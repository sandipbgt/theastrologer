    "horoscope": "Give someone your strength and emotional support today. You're feeling wonderfully strong yourself, so you're in the perfect position to help someone else who needs it. And you're especially wise now, because you're in touch with the deepest part of yourself -- the part that has lived through tough times and come out intact on the other side. Your friends and family can gain a lot of comfort and understanding from you today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
