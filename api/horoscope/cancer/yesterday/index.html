    "horoscope": "If other people aren't as keen on your goals and plans as you are, don't take offense. If you can't seem to gain any support for your project, retire from public life for the day. It's perfectly okay to do that, you know. You'll find it a lot easier to initiate things in private, where you have only your own vision to contend with. Soon you'll rejoin the group and impress everyone with your progress.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
