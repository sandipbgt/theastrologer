    "horoscope": "Maybe you shouldn't socialize today. You're feeling a little sensitive right now, plus you have that temper. It would be too easy to make trouble for people who don't deserve what you'd throw down. Choose where and when you can vent. Factor in the friends who can handle you. And you know what? It might not even be a big deal. Find a sympathetic ear, unload your problems until you get to their cause, and you'll feel a lot better. Then spend your time on what makes you happy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
