    "horoscope": "If you've been experiencing tension with a friend, relative or coworker, today is a good day to negotiate peace. Most people want to get along now, so it's a good time to talk things out and find common ground. Just make sure you go into the discussion with positive intentions. That means a commitment  to being reasonable, even if you feel frustrated or upset. Make a conscious effort to maintain your emotional balance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
