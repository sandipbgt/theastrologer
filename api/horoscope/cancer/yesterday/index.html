But don't let your anxiety get the better of you. Sometimes, these little reality checks are a good thing. They keep you on track, living within your limits. This is a sign that it's time to work a little harder or be more careful with your funds.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
