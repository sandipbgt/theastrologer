    "horoscope": "It's important to maintain your emotional equilibrium today. If you feel a little moody, it's probably from the normal tensions that arise from being in close quarters with other people. And yet, retreating may not be the answer. The current cosmic energy is all about cooperation and compromise. If you're getting along with your spouse or a business associate seems impossible, try putting in a little more effort to seek common ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
