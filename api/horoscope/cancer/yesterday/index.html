Are you trying to prove your loyalty? Groupthink could sway you a little too easily today. It's good that you're speaking up, but use the opportunity to request what works for you personally. Maybe you'll raise a few eyebrows, fracture the party line or push someone else out of the way. It can't be helped, at least not if you're being true to who you really are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
