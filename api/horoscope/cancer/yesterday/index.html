    "horoscope": "Your emotions are stirred up today, as are a lot of people's feelings. But while others may feel gloomy or unsettled, you're tapped into the sweetest side of life. Your affection for other people swells. You're able to view others generously, even those who may have hurt you in the past. It's a very good day to forgive and forget, because you're even more compassionate than usual -- and that's saying a lot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
