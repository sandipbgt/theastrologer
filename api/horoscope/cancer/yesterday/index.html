    "horoscope": "It's a great day to get a lot accomplished, because you feel strong and determined. But in some cases, you may be a little too powerful! You're willing to stand up for yourself if necessary, but under the current influence, it's quite possible to overreact. Many people are more prone to jumping to conclusions right now. If you find yourself feeling hurt or irritated, take some time to consider the situation before you respond.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
