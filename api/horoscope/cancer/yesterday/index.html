    "horoscope": "Today is mellow and pleasant, and you may overindulge in something, whether it's food, relaxation or some other sensory experience. But that's okay. Some days are just perfect for giving in to your every physical desire, and this is one of those days. You're in an affectionate mood, so be sure to connect with your honey or your family. Pamper yourself. You rarely do this, and you deserve it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
