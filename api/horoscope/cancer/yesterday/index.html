But really, life would get dull and unfulfilling quickly. Not everyone stays the same, after all, including you. Even if you don't realize it, little shifts are occurring beneath the surface of your life. Don't let that scare you. Go ahead and appoint yourself guardian of all that's normal and conventional. But don't be surprised when interesting things start to occur.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
