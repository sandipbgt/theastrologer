    "horoscope": "Spend time in familiar places today, surrounded by people you love and trust. Your energy may be a bit low, though your mood is likely to be pleasant. There's nothing better now than sharing a hug with a good friend, or connecting in any way that affirms your mutual affection. You may find yourself serving as someone's emotional rock. You offer such comfort and good advice, it's no wonder they rely on you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
