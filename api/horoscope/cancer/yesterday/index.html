    "horoscope": "Your feelings intensify today. Whatever you're experiencing at an emotional level, you'll feel it deeply and acutely. If you're in an affectionate or romantic mood, it's a wonderful time to make a sweet connection with someone you love. But even feelings like sadness and compassion are enjoyable, simply because they're honest. You're steeped in your own, subjective experience of life, and that's a comfortable state for you to be in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
