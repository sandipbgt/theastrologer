    "horoscope": "You're a quick learner. Talking with others helps you make connections that, until recently, seemed impossible. But communication is on your side now, and your mind and soul are working in tandem. Soon, you'll grasp the universal applications of something you've previously only considered on a local scale. That's certainly worth putting in the effort, so stay alert and energetic today. A balanced diet plus plenty of sleep and exercise can keep you in top form for whatever you have ahead of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
