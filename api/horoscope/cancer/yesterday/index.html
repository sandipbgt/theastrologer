    "horoscope": "Your compassion swells today. Your big heart grows even larger. You're willing to do just about anything to help others, because you're even more aware than usual of their needs and their pain. If someone near you is feeling vulnerable, you'll pick up on it, even if they're broadcasting bravado. This is a real gift. If you use it with care, you can help people feel more comfortable in their own skin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
