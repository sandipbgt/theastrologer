    "horoscope": "Today you feel extra driven to make your dreams and ambitions a concrete reality. You're savvy enough to realize this is going to take some careful planning. Consulting with an expert is a good idea, or with someone who has done the thing you would like to do. Doing research on your own is also productive. Take notes as you gather data, so you can create a realistic picture of the end result.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
