    "horoscope": "If you have children in your family, or if you teach children, they're on your mind today, even more than usual. You're feeling creative. Perhaps you'll think up a fun, interesting new activity to try out with the kids. If children aren't a part of your life, access your own inner child today. Be playful. Look at the world with fresh eyes. Create a work of art, or at least get crafty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
