    "horoscope": "You may be avoiding your work today. Don't miss important deadlines, but it's probably okay to cut yourself some slack, at least a little. Normally you're quite a hard worker, but your heart's just not in it today. You're better off getting out of your office chair and going to have some fun for a few minutes. Then you'll be more focused and ready to put in some hard effort when you return to work later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
