    "horoscope": "Today, it may feel as if you're having to clean up after everyone else's messes, in addition to your own. At least this phase can't last long. Your best bet is just to put your head down and focus on the job at hand. And do try not to slip into the role of martyr. It's possible that you're putting out a little more effort than is strictly necessary. If so, recognize that that's your choice. Don't blame this on anyone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
