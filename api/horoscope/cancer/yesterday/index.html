For another, it gives you an opportunity to prove your skills. Standing on your own two feet, especially when you're doing difficult work, feels good because it draws on your inner strength. You have a very strong core, though you may forget that sometimes. But not today!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
