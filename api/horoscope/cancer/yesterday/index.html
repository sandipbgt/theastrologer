For better or for worse, you're a caring, committed kind of person. The experience of loving someone enriches you. Capitalize on this now. Share something you've been holding back, or reveal your deepest truths to someone who cares. Build true intimacy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
