    "horoscope": "Taking a careful, logical approach to your duties today brings you a sense of inner security. And this should be easy to do. Focus is readily available, if you simply tap into it. You're able to set emotional concerns aside and concentrate on the basics. What needs to be done, and how are you going to do it? Best of all, your calmness and thoroughness are sure to satisfy even a nitpicky employer or client.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
