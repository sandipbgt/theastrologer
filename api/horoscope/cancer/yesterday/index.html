    "horoscope": "Beware of the sudden shifts that sometimes happen between nurturing and addiction. They always start from a thin line, and you could swagger across it all too easily. So instead of dancing on the brink of disaster, take a step back from the world you created. Look at something else for a while. Once you revisit the environment that used to surround you, it'll seem unusually small and maybe hard to identify. Should you be worried or relieved? You have a day to locate it on the map while you think about that one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
