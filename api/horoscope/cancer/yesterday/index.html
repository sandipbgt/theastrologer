But it's days like this when you should challenge yourself to see things from a new perspective. Don't limit yourself to status-quo thinking. Get familiar with new ideas and theories, especially those that challenge you. Your strong reaction indicates there's something important to explore.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
