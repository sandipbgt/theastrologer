    "horoscope": "Ritual and habit come easily to you; they're part of that solid foundation you've built for yourself and your family. Security is important to you, after all, Cancer. You've got inner strength to spare, and despite your occasional withdrawal from life, you're a champion at handling whatever comes your way. Good thing, because today could prove a bit of a test. Work demands your attention, as does an important personal relationship. Put effort into both, and be ready to satisfy people's curiosity. Maybe they just want to know how you make it look so easy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
