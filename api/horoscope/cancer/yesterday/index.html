    "horoscope": "A tranquil mood sets in today. You're always generous with the people you care about, but now you're especially unselfish. Drawing a bath for your child or cooking a meal for your family -- tasks like these nurture yourself as well as others. You're softhearted enough to listen to a friend's problems with great compassion, and sturdy enough to give them the advice they need. This is real emotional balance,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
