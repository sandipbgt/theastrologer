Elemental passions are smoldering today -- don't let this opportunity pass you by! There's too much fun to be had. Instead of burying yourself in your work or family responsibilities, take your sweetie out on a romantic date. Or, if you're unattached, approach that certain someone who's caught your eye. What do you have to lose?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
