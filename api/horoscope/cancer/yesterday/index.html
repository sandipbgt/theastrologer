    "horoscope": "The people around you may seem a bit juvenile today, but don't hold it against them. Everyone's in a silly mood now -- in fact, it's infectious, if you allow yourself to loosen up and join in the fun. Of course, if you have a lot to do, a chatty cubicle-mate is more annoying than anything else. Be flexible about your agenda, and don't expect to be left in solitude for long.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
