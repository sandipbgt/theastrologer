They probably didn't mean anything by it. Take the gracious route by letting your friend off the hook. And try not to be so sensitive. If they said something truly tactless, be calm and direct in letting them know how you feel, so everyone can move on quickly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
