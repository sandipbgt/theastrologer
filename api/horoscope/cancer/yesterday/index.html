Naturally, you want to help them out -- that's just your compassionate self in action. So express your hopes, needs and feelings to others, and encourage them to do the same. That way, you'll get everybody on the same page. You'll find a common goal that you can work on together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
