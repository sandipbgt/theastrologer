    "horoscope": "You're extra big-hearted today. Your kindness knows no bounds. You're also a strong and sensible person, so it's unlikely that you would allow anyone to take advantage of your goodwill. That's a great combination. It allows you to protect yourself even as you're doing what you can to serve others. And people could really use the kind of nurturing compassion you possess today,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
