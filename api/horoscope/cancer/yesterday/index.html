    "horoscope": "The good times seem to be all gone. Friends are looking transparent as their motives show through. Well, everyone has their reasons, don't they? You can even admit there was some calculation behind your own wild abandon. Suddenly you're revisiting everything that happened in a dim, disapproving light, seeing betrayal instead of loyalty. Why do this to yourself? If you don't stop it right now, you'll have a vacant, gloomy day. Restart the party soon, OK? Even a scaled-down version could help you, since nobody deserves this kind of letdown.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
