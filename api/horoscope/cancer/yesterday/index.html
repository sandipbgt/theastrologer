That way, you can be as efficient as you like, and no one will get in your way. If you have to cooperate with others, you may find yourself being impatient with them for no good reason. Try to remember they're doing the best they can, just like you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
