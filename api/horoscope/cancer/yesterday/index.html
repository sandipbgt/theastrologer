    "horoscope": "Your personal and professional partnerships are highlighted today. You may have reached an impasse with your business partner or your sweetheart -- some issue about which you both feel passionately that your own perspective is the right one. Under the current energy, it's important to make an effort to see the other person's side of things. Stubborn insistence on getting your way isn't favored now, but your efforts to cooperate will be rewarded.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
