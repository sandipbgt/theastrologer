If there's been an elephant in the room with you and your sweetie or your business partner -- something that's obvious to both of you, despite your mutual attempts to ignore it -- talk it out now. Do your best to stay calm and compassionate, even if you feel angry or upset. A peacekeeping attitude is favored now, whereas a stubborn or aggressive tone won't serve you well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
