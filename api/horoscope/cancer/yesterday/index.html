    "horoscope": "Keep compromise in mind today as an ideal and a goal. It's easy now to slip into leadership mode, especially if you perceive that someone near you is being indecisive. You rarely have trouble making even tough decisions, but now it's important to gauge the wants and needs of the group before acting. This may seem tedious, but everyone involved will feel supported if you take the time to find common ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
