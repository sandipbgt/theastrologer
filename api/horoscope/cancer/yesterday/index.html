    "horoscope": "Life could get a little complex today. But it's the kind of complexity you enjoy, and certainly the kind you can handle. A heart-to-heart talk brings you closer to someone. It feels good to listen and offer them advice, or even an apology, if need be. After all, knowing another person on an emotional level promotes intimacy. Knowing your own true feelings brings you into closer alignment with yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
