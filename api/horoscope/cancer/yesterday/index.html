Aside from the fact that time travel doesn't exist, stagnation and regression aren't nearly as appealing as they might seem. This mood you're in will pass soon, thank goodness! Instead of avoiding all new and odd influences, make an effort to connect with others and with your own inner calm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
