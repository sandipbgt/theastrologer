    "horoscope": "You look back at old arguments and other tense situations from your past, and still feel their sting. You know you were in the right, you stood up for what you believed in, and yet you were misunderstood and mistreated. Right? Well, maybe. It's likely that you're not remembering those moments clearly, and it's doubtful that they were your finest hour. Try focusing forward today. The future might be even better than this past you recall so fondly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
