    "horoscope": "Many people are in sober or even dour moods today. The world seems like a grim, unsmiling place. But don't let this get you down. Folks are just working hard. It's a good day for tending to your responsibilities, especially professional ones. Success and ambition seem to matter now more than usual. And your endurance is certainly higher than usual. Take advantage of this focused energy while it lasts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
