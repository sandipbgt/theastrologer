Other people may think they have to walk on eggshells around you so they won't hurt your feelings. Be grateful for their consideration, and take extra measures to handle yourself with care. For starters, avoid loud noises, unpleasant odors and aggressive people. They don't agree with you right now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
