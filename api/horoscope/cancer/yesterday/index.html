    "horoscope": "You're in a sunny mood today, even if there's foul weather outside. Your heart is warm, and you want to laugh and connect with your favorite people. Emotional security is crucial to you today, so spend time with someone whose affections you know you can trust. They're probably feeling sweet and slightly vulnerable too, so let each other know in no uncertain terms how you really appreciate the other.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
