    "horoscope": "Welcome to a dreamy day. Get some extra sleep, if possible. Take a nap, or get to bed early. You have a bit less energy than usual, plus, resting your eyes gives your mind the freedom to roam. Your imagination is enhanced by the current influence. Your dreams may be vivid, or during waking hours, your mind might wander into fanciful daydreams. Some of these visions may be worth writing down!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
