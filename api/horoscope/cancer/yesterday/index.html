    "horoscope": "You like having choices, but you might get more than you can handle today. If you're lucky, this is because all your available options seem equally appealing, and it's difficult to choose just one. Too bad you can't always be stuck between this type of rock and hard place! Still, try not to be paralyzed by indecision. Focus on what's truly at stake, and make your choice. For best results, listen to your heart. It never steers you wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
