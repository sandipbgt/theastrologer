But you're able to stand back and assess a situation for what it is. What you probably see is vulnerability. Most bad behaviors people engage in now stem from deep-rooted feelings of fear, sadness or loss. Understanding this enables you to help someone be honest about their true emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
