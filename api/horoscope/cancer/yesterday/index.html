    "horoscope": "Connect with the people you love. You and many others are in the mood for affection. If you've been experiencing tension with a friend, you can work through it effectively today -- as long as you're willing to reach out in a spirit of compromise. That's the key to all your interactions now. Let people know you're willing to work with them, and they'll bend over backward to work with you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
