    "horoscope": "A warm, affectionate mood makes you extra generous today. You want everyone you know to enjoy themselves, and you'll certainly enjoy their company. It's a great time to get people together for a meal or a party. Some folks might be in fine form, telling tall tales and boasting about their exploits. That's okay. It's easy to let them off the hook. They're just having a good time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
