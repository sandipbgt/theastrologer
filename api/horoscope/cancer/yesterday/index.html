    "horoscope": "Imposing order on your world makes you feel calm, safe and secure. Eating wholesome, nutritious food or serving it to your family makes you feel good, because you know you're doing the right thing for your health. So take today to cook, clean or organize your living space. These simple acts turn into equally simple pleasures, ones that provide you with great peace of mind. And that gift is priceless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
