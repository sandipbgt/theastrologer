    "horoscope": "Most people may not realize this about you, but you have a competitive streak. You want to be and do your best. This urge comes to the fore today in a big way. If you feel challenged by someone, you'll step up and defend yourself. This is pretty different from other days, when you're more likely to retreat and lick your wounds. Strength is positive. Just be sure to choose your battles!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
