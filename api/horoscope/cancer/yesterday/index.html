So if you happen to be there when someone else's juicy details leak out, don't be so quick to share that stuff with the gossip hounds. Yes, you know people like that, and maybe you've been one. Today, be a shining example of trust and discretion, as you keep your lips zipped and your heart open.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
