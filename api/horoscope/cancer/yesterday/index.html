Emotional security is important to you, and now a sense of stability comes from simple things like hard work, a balanced meal and good sleep at night. If you haven't been taking care of yourself lately, it's a good day to get back on track with your diet or exercise regimen. Establish a workable routine and follow it to the letter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
