    "horoscope": "Yesterday's serene, tuned-in mood has vanished like smoke, replaced today by actual. You feel scattered and frazzled, and perhaps defensive. Anyone who gets in your way today could feel the brunt of your mood, unless you take special care to rein in your angry feelings. And what are you so upset about, anyway? Maybe it's time to tune in to yourself and see what's out of balance. Don't take it out on others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
