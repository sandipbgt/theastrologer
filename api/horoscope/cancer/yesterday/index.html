    "horoscope": "Of course you have opinions. Who doesn't? But those opinions won't guarantee that you'll be the good guy in everyone's movie. Bottom line: use your social skills to stop any ripples before they make waves. Do your part to keep the discussion in a shared comfort zone. Be discreet today, and nurture the people who need to be calmed and welcomed. The unseen and unsaid are still the elephants in the room, so carefully hug the walls and you won't be the one to step in something that might stick to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
