    "horoscope": "Familiar places and faces bring you great comfort today. Share your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust, whether in person or in a letter, email or phone call. Doing so is sharing your very soul -- the best, most personal gift you can give to a friend. They'll want to do the same, too. You can help each other with problems and give each other great support for the people you've become.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
