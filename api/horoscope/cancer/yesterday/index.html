    "horoscope": "Spend some time today making your home comfortable and attractive. It's good to do this kind of work periodically, so you don't have to worry about it last-minute if someone comes over. Plus, making your surroundings reflect your personal style will help smooth some of the rough edges this day could present. Just don't get upset when someone comes and plops down on the couch cushions you just straightened.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
