    "horoscope": "It's a very good day for spending some close, one-on-one time with your sweetheart, if you have one. If you're single, take advantage of today's deeply passionate vibe by connecting with someone who is near and dear to you -- your best friend, a dear relative, even your favorite pet. Today is for exploring emotional connections and rejoicing in their depth and complexity. This is truly what makes life worth living.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
