Your creativity is also high now, and interacting with others can really stimulate your imagination. Whether on canvas or in your own mind, you paint vivid pictures of the many possibilities you're imagining. And rest assured, other people are impressed by your inventive ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
