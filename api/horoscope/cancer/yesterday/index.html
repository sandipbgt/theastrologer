If you're an emotional eater, don't be surprised if you feel the urge to consume your favorite comfort foods! But remember that time spent with a trusted friend can be even more emotionally satisfying. Alone time might be crucial now, too. Retreat from the hubbub of your daily life, if you need to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
