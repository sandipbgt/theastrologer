This day is best used for quiet activities like reading, scrapbooking, writing and anything else that involves your imagination. Put your heart into whatever you do now, and keep your company lighthearted and uplifting. At the end of the day, you'll feel clean and refreshed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
