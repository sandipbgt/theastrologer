    "horoscope": "You move efficiently throughout your day, rising gracefully to any challenges and meeting the demands of your job or family. This is like flexing the muscles of your mind. Whatever comes up, you deal with it, and you do so calmly and with confidence, because you know you can handle it. On other days when you may not feel quite so secure, you'll think back to today and remember how capable you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
