Today you'll offer everyone witty advice and conservative financial tips. Be careful about taking your own recommendations. Most likely, you're accurate in your figuring. Still, take a wait and see attitude instead of jumping into what looks like a lucrative or foolproof prospect. There's no harm in giving people ideas. Wait a few days before acting upon them yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
