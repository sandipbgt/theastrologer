    "horoscope": "You tend to toe the line, bowing to the usual way of doing things and upholding tradition. But sometimes disorder and rebellion are necessary. Every now and again, they're unavoidable responses to the claustrophobic world that surrounds you. Today you'll surprise everyone by sticking up for the individual instead of the group. Just don't act childish or lash out unreasonably. It's possible to be mature even as you're rebelling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
