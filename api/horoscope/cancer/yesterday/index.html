    "horoscope": "You're extra witty and affectionate today. This is a great day for chatting with friends or creating art -- or, if you can manage it, both. Invite your favorite people over for a cooking, sewing, painting or writing party. You'll find that a group of people working together puts out incredible creative energy, even if you're working on separate projects. And don't forget that even baking a batch of cookies is a creative process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
