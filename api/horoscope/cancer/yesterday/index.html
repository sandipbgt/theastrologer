    "horoscope": "Sometimes, the best thing to do is to laugh. There can even be humor in painful memories -- in fact, that's one good way to process and work through them. It's okay to make wry jokes about your own past, but try to leave your family out of it, if you can. Recognize that they did the best they could with what they had. Besides, you never know who's listening in today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
