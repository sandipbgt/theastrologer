    "horoscope": "You're traditional by nature, but today, time-honored methods and values mean even more to you than usual. Taking the tried-and-true path toward any goal feels like a solid choice. And stability counts for a lot now, too. So focus on building up a relationship or a system in your life such as career or your finances. Do this with an eye toward making things last.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
