    "horoscope": "While foolish consistency is the mark of a small mind, consistency itself is okay. Don't stick to the status quo purely out of fear, especially if change is needed. But familiar patterns and activities are good for you now. They create a sense of comfort, which will help tone down any nervousness you may be suffering at the moment. However you handle this day, don't be downhearted. Solid focus and forward momentum will work wonders at improving your mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
