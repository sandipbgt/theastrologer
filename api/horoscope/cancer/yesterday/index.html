    "horoscope": "You're self-protective by nature, which is why you're so private and reserved. It's also why you withdraw from the hubbub of daily life to relax and regroup. But today you can reflect the energy you get from the people around you, without having to protect yourself so much. Everyone currently in your life is a friend. Accept your allies' help graciously. Lean on them now because soon, they'll be leaning on you once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
