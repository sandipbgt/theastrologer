    "horoscope": "You're in touch today with the best parts of your own nature: your compassion, your capacity to understand and forgive others, and your ability to nurture the people you adore. People can sense your warmth from a mile away, so don't be surprised if acquaintances and even strangers come to you for advice or support. You can afford to give out extra now, but you'll reserve your best for your loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
