    "horoscope": "Lots of folks are feeling opinionated and impassioned today. Don't be afraid to speak your mind, too -- even if that means disagreeing with someone. Hey, it's all in the name of learning something new, right? And discussions can be broad-ranging without becoming tense or contentious. Try not to take it personally if someone challenges your point of view, either. Take it as a compliment that you got them so engaged.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
