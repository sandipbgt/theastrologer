    "horoscope": "You're too prudent to overspend. This might not always be true; at other times and in other places, you might deem it more important to be comfortable or generous than to guard your pocketbook. But for right now, there's no burning desire pushing you to purchase or consume. In fact, you feel kind of quiet inside -- a calm of the soul, if you will. Tomorrow you might be ready for more retail therapy, but for now, you're happy with what you have. Isn't that a wonderfully peaceful state of being?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
