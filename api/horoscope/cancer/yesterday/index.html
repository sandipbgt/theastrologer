    "horoscope": "Welcome to an emotional day, one that may be full of ups and downs. You're saturated with feeling, like a sponge filled with. You might even feel weepy, and you're likely to feel especially sensitive. But this is actually an enjoyable state of mind for you. Feeling your feelings, deeply and honestly, is simply your nature. You don't mind a sense of melancholy, as long as it's real.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
