    "horoscope": "You're being honest with some people, but secretive with others. What are you trying to hide? Figure it out soon, because if everyone starts comparing notes, they might notice before you have time to explain yourself. Your friends and family are important to you, so be sure to come clean with them first. It's likely, though, that all this is just momentary insecurity. If you open up, you'll probably find people are far more understanding than you expected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
