    "horoscope": "Don't drift off into dreamland today, however tempting it may be. Sure, you're feeling uncertain. But retreating from the real world won't help. Work on keeping your energy constant. That way, you'll have a much easier time seeing your challenges and moving around them. You can do this, if you try. And soon, when you're feeling more focused and on top of things, you can pat yourself on the back for holding yourself together so effectively.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
