    "horoscope": "Your personal talents are on display today. It feels wonderful to express yourself creatively, in whatever way that applies to your lifestyle and skills. Plus, you might receive some recognition for the work you do now. But if that well-deserved recognition doesn't come, don't let it affect your good mood. Just keep going, refining your work and making it more and more closely representative of your authentic self.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
