    "horoscope": "Maybe you're not comfortable physically or emotionally. You remember what happened the last time you pushed yourself outside of your zone. But why are you so sure the same thing will happen again? Also, showing too much caution or hesitation will make you look wishy-washy. Listen, don't let these fears consume you, or there won't be any of the good stuff left. Stand up for something today, preferably something you believe in. Bring your creativity online and run with it. By that point you might not even care what anyone else thinks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
