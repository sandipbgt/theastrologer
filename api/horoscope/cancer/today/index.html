You're still waiting for what should have happened a long time ago, so you're probably a bit frustrated, too. Things fall apart too easily, and nobody understands a word you say. Well, how would you know that when you jump each time someone moves in your direction? Aren't these people supposed to be your friends? Lay off the caffeine today. Get more sleep and exercise. See if all that helps you lower this impossibly high bar you're still trying to hurdle.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
