    "horoscope": "You have great respect for tradition -- the people who have gone before you and established proper protocol or logical rules to follow. Today, you can show your respect for tradition by staying within those lines. Straying outside the boundaries of acceptable behavior isn't favored now. But that's not really you, anyway. You actually enjoy rules and step-by-step processes. They make life easier, comfortable and organized.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
