    "horoscope": "Maybe you had your doubts, but not any more. One good argument will finally sway you. One little peek behind the curtain will reveal what you've been ignoring. One touch of a friendly hand will melt your glacier of denial. Now that you believe, you can heal from the pain of not knowing, and relax from the pressure of not caring. Work on clearing out your past junk today. It'll be a relief, but it'll also be a first step. As soon as you give yourself room to move, there won't be anything stopping you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
