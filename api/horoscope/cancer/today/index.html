    "horoscope": "Your creative streak is on a tear. No matter how you've been using this energy up to now, it suddenly becomes desirable. Designers are now artisans. Hacks become wordsmiths. This is a day of artistic ambition, when everything you touch turns to creative gold. There are no guarantees that you'll find success of course, but you'll have fun trying, and that's the most important part. This is your hour to open the inner door.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
