There are many more reasons for you to change than excuses not to, so no more resisting. It's time to get on board. Identify which parts of your life aren't working, and resolve to transform them or let them go. And don't lament too much over any losses you experience now. Remember, you're making room for something fresh to come into your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
