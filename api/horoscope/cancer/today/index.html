You have plenty to focus on at home, such as nurturing yourself and your sweetie, or fortifying your finances and other personal systems. You actually welcome slow, simple days like this one. You know from experience that with a little effort, your daily life could be even sweeter than it already is.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
