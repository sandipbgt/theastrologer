    "horoscope": "Don't let mild worries get you down today, or they could turn into a melancholy feeling. You can distract yourself with busywork around the house or office, but that only works for so long. At some point, you may need to break down and call a friend -- someone with a more optimistic outlook. Their good spirits will help you realize that things aren't so bad after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
