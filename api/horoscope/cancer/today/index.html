    "horoscope": "If a certain relationship or business partnership feels strained today, you may have to set aside your feelings in order to work through the issue. That could be tough for you to do, especially if your feelings are hurt. But being able to focus on what's most important -- working harmoniously together -- shows an impressive level of maturity. And you'd much rather work together than have to strike out on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
