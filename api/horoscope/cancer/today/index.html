Normally your emotions might color your perspective, but now you're deeply in touch with reality, which enables you to set aside your feelings, if need be, to get the job done. This might seem like a highly mechanical way of operating, but sometimes, that's a real benefit! Taking the straightest line from point A to point B brings a real sense of accomplishment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
