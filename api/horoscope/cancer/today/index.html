    "horoscope": "This is the type of relaxed, slow-paced day you really enjoy, when you're feeling mellow and everyone around you seems content. There's no need to put out fires, and if an emergency does arise, you're able to greet it in a grounded, practical way. Speaking of work, if you have to be at the office today, you'll find your output is pretty impressive. Your employer is sure to notice, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
