    "horoscope": "Emotional issues may come up today, including ones from the past. In general, you're feeling softer, which could mean more romantic or more vulnerable than usual. In this mood, it's important to protect yourself, but it's also a good time to reveal your true feelings, including needs and hurts, to someone. Even if this leads to a difficult conversation, it can create much greater understanding and intimacy between you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
