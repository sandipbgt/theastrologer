    "horoscope": "It's a good day to work tirelessly toward a concrete goal, such as finding a job, getting a promotion or increasing the size of your nest egg. Anything you do today that increases your long-term financial security is favored. But do your homework. Before committing to a savings or investment plan, research it thoroughly so you know what you're getting into. A cautious approach is the best idea now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
