    "horoscope": "You have great determination today. If you're working on a tough project, you'll persevere until the end. How could you not? You're filled with grounded energy. Instinctively, you know how to draw from it steadily rather than using it up in fits and starts. Measured output takes you far. Be sure to pencil in time for relaxation, too. After the hard work you're putting in, you'll deserve a break!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
