    "horoscope": "Spend time today with the people you love and trust. Along with most other people, you're feeling a bit emotionally sensitive now. The outside world could seem like a harsh or lonely place. But being at home, surrounded by beloved pets or your favorite folks? That's precious indeed. If you're far away from home or loved ones, connect with them in some other way. The main thing is to reaffirm your bond.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
