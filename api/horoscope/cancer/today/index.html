    "horoscope": "Your intuitions are extra strong today. You can read people quite clearly, even if they're bottling up their true feelings. It's especially easy to read your friends and loved ones, and to make them feel well cared for. The best kind of love you can offer, after all, is your compassion. When someone feels truly understood, it's as good as a hug. This is the gift you can give others today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
