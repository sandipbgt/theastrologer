You'll impress people with your hard work, but you might also come up against, especially if you think you know exactly what your partner or customer wants. Ah, well; don't let this tide of intense energy sweep you away. Instead, wade carefully and keep your eyes on a fixed point on the horizon. Things will get easier very soon, at which point all the work you accomplished during this brief period will bear fruit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
