    "horoscope": "Today you're infused with energy. If you channel it correctly, you can get a great deal accomplished. But be sure to schedule in some downtime. You're an emotional creature, and going hard all day long saps your energy. That could make you sad or cranky. Avoid this by taking regular breaks. Withdraw to your office or your home. Shut the door for a few minutes of blessed privacy, when you can recharge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
