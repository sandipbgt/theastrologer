    "horoscope": "It's a sentimental day. You might feel especially sweet on your honey or your kids, or a certain song on the radio might bring tears to your eyes, out of the blue. It's also one of those days when the past and the present blend in a haze of nostalgia. Go ahead and indulge in these bittersweet emotions. Sometimes it's fun to relive old memories, even if they tug at your heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
