Little do they know that inside, you're churning with dark, beautiful passion. And only a lucky few will see it today, the full Cancer you. One thing is sure: Anyone who gets a taste of your imagination or the yearning you have to connect with other people will be blown away.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
