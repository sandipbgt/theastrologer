Seal your lips for the time being, lest you give yourself away. Pay attention and make sure you have all the facts before making a move. This is no time to be hasty. You're uncomfortable enough. Rash decisions would make things worse. If you try harder to understand what's happening, you'll be the one who's informed and on top of things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
