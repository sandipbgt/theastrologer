    "horoscope": "Helping others is a great way to spend your day, and it's right in line with your sensitive mindset. You can tell if someone near you is sad, worried or lonely today, and you're happy to lend a strong shoulder and a compassionate ear. You've always been good about setting firm personal boundaries, so don't worry about someone trying to take advantage of you. Just do your thing and lend a hand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
