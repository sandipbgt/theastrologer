    "horoscope": "Disloyalty upsets you. You need to know you can rely on your friends, and you return the favor by being incredibly dependable, yourself. But if someone seems unreliable today, don't write them off or judge them too harshly. They may just be in their own world right now, managing their own concerns. Try to take a compassionate view,. That shouldn't be difficult for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
