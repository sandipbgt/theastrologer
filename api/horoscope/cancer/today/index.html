    "horoscope": "The past reemerges in some way today. Maybe you're just feeling sentimental. If so, it's a good day to look through old letters or photo albums. If your nostalgia is sweet, then enjoy it. But if it makes you melancholy, turn your focus firmly toward the present. Today marks the start of a new personal cycle for you, so resolve to move forward in your life. It's a whole new day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
