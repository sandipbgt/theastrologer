If you're going to all the trouble of making your own world, you deserve to enjoy every little detail. But don't ignore others as you wander through the richness of personal creation. They're not going to let you bail out of your responsibilities. Not that you were planning to flake, were you? That would upset the balance that's letting you take this mental vacation. It's about dancing to the music and paying the piper. Just keep everything in harmony, OK?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
