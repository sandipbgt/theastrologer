You enjoy knowing you're part of something greater than just yourself -- something that reaches further than you could hope for on your own. And you're glad to keep your intentions and essence pure. Spend a moment thanking those who went before you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
