    "horoscope": "Now you're feeling deeply balanced. Things just seem right, somehow. Even if you have problems to deal with or hard work ahead of you, you can handle it. And that's what it's all about, isn't it? Knowing you can catch the curve balls life throws your way. On a day like this, though, there shouldn't be too many unpleasant surprises.
