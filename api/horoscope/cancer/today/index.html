This might be as simple as furniture in your home that was passed down from older relatives, or the family recipes you refer to time and again when you're wondering what to make for dinner. Or this might be something less tangible. Perhaps you tell your children stories your parents used to tell you. Revel in this passing on of history.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
