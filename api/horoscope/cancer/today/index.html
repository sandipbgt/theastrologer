    "horoscope": "You have clear ambitions, but you're sensitive enough that competition makes you uncomfortable. That dynamic could somehow come into play today. You may have to prove yourself at work, or take the lead in some familial situation, though you fervently wish things would work themselves out. These challenges are good for you, even if they make you tense. It's important to learn to balance your sensitive side with your considerable inner strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
