    "horoscope": "A new personal cycle begins for you today. This might be obvious: You're feeling emotional, but not moody. Serenity is yours, whether you're content, worried or sad. But odds are, you're in a good mood. You feel capable and strong, and you're looking forward to the next several weeks. Make a goal for the next month. Decide what's most important to you, and set out a plan for achieving it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
