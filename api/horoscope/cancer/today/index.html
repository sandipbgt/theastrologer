It might also mean resolving an issue with your sweetheart or house mate that's been making things tense between you. If you do have to talk out a problem today, do so in the spirit of compromise. Negotiate something you both can live with.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
