Left to their own devices, people might simply access their anger. But under your influence, and with your encouragement, they can start talking about the hurt feelings that lie behind the anger. That's exactly how healing and understanding begin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
