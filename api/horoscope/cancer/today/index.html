    "horoscope": "Turn your attention toward the practical side of life today. Focus on financial or business matters. Being proactive is one of your strong points, so put this skill to use in a functional way. You can launch a project at work, or assess your budget as the first step in getting it under control. These activities may seem monotonous, but you'll find it's easy to get absorbed in them, once you begin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
