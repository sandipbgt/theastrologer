    "horoscope": "It's a great day for a romantic or friendly date. This can be with someone special, but you can also take yourself out for a movie or a delicious meal at a restaurant. Or ask a friend to join you, if you don't want to go alone. The emphasis now should be on enjoying yourself, first and foremost. Indulge in sweeping feelings, such as love, yearning and humor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
