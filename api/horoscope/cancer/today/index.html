Admit that you play a crucial role, whether you're working at high levels of strategy or just tracking the ordinary details. In other words, the life you're living has its priceless value in every little thing you do. Today you might even be ready to defend what you love, but take off the gloves. It probably won't come to that. Nobody's challenging what you do. If anything, they're curious about your methods.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
