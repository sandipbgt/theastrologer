    "horoscope": "You're spry and communicative, and in the mood to connect with other people. This might be a great time to throw an impromptu dinner party for your favorite friends, or at least take a walk somewhere you'll run into other humans. This is no time to seclude yourself away somewhere. You're too upbeat and expressive to be alone. Whatever happens, you'll feel fine -- even if you don't accomplish anything great. And that has to count for something, doesn't it?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
