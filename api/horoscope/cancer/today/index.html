    "horoscope": "You like to be courteous to everyone in your life But today, that courtesy will morph into true selflessness. You give of yourself to others, which makes you a positive influence on everyone around you. You're building quite a fine reputation, you know. This kind of behavior leads to unexpected support and allies later on, when you need it. Best of all, you simply see a need and respond to it, because you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
