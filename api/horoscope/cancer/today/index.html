    "horoscope": "Trust the forces of progress and the good intentions of your neighbors. Learn to be comfortable with change even if your current specialty is living in the past. Tasteful choices will always make you popular, but accurate timing will play an even bigger role today. Be where you say you'll be, bring a little something extra, and know when to throw it down for maximum effect. In other words, recognize your own powers and don't be afraid to use them every chance you get. If you want life to keep on being excellent, you owe this much to yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
