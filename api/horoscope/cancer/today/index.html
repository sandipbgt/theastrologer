    "horoscope": "Your loved ones appreciate that you're currently so focused on their health and safety. You're making them feel properly cared for, and you can bet that they'll return the favor sometime when you need it. But that's not why you're doing it -- and that's what makes it even more genuine. Today, everyone around you benefits from your warm, nurturing protection, and they'll remember it. Isn't it nice to know you're helping build a loving, caring community?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
