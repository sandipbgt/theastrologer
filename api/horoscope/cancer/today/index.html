    "horoscope": "There's no question about your versatility at the moment. You're feeling strong and in tune with yourself. You have a message, and you know exactly what it is. In fact, you might feel so centered that you're actually concerned about wasting your talents. Try not to worry about this. Today represents a brief waiting period -- one you can't get out of, no matter what you try to negotiate. You can find a better outlet for your talents, but you might not find it today. Give it just a little time. You're sure to come out on top.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
