    "horoscope": "You might start off the day in a strange or grouchy mood, but spending time with people you care about will help you mellow into something sweeter. Part of the problem today is that you perceive a distance between yourself and your loved ones. There's an emotional aloofness that sets you on edge, because you're all about warmth and intimacy. Remember, this won't last long. Soon, you'll feel close again with the people you adore.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
