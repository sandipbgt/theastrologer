For the time being, following the rules helps you get the job done. This doesn't feel restrictive or oppressive; it just feels right. So keep covering all your bases and checking in with coworkers, family members and anyone else who counts. You'll get it all done, and you'll feel great when you do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
