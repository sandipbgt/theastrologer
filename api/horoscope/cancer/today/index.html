    "horoscope": "Everyone finds you charming and even more kind today. You're feeling especially content, which makes it even easier to reach out to others. With your natural sense of timing, you're able to turn each moment into the right one -- a real gift. You're building a great reputation -- what will you do with all this positive esteem? Think about your goals, and then ask people for support. You don't always have to be the one pitching in for others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
