    "horoscope": "Your dynamic range will be appropriate today. At least that's what you'll say formally or in business situations. You could also describe it as not pushing your luck or running your mouth. Conserve or spend as needed, depending on your hidden weaknesses and known blind spots. As a fragile being housed within a robust exterior, it'll be important to keep your senses and emotions in tune. This will make you easy to be around, and much easier to enjoy your own company. Because if you can't be your own best friend, who else is there?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
