    "horoscope": "Today, life takes on an emotional intensity that it normally doesn't have -- and you love this. Even challenging experiences can have their own satisfaction, because you connect with them so deeply. Everything from love to anger is a learning experience now. Your relationships provide you with wonderful chances to grow and improve. And that's exactly what you love about them. Enjoy this impassioned experience of life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
