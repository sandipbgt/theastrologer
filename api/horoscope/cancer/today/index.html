    "horoscope": "Many people have high energy today, you included. But while others may also be in high spirits, your own extra energy could express itself through your temper, leading to tense moments with other people. If you have trouble dealing with anyone today, watch your own attitude. It's easy to speak sharply now without meaning to, or even realizing you've done so. Do your best to stay calm and be kind, even if you're irritated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
