    "horoscope": "Sometimes it's nice just to go with the program, comforted that the script you're following is tried and true. Today the rules nurture you. Challenging the status quo doesn't feel right. You're also not particularly interested in performing above expectations. You're most comfortable operating in the middle of things. Orderly living will divide today into short, easily digestible segments. That's just how you want it. You're happy to ignore chaos or sensationalism, and just be regular.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
