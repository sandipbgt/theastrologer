If you're required to take charge of a group or situation, you should have little trouble -- except that other people are in touch with their inner authorities now, too. You might go head to head with someone whose ego pushes them to challenge your leadership. At least you aren't as emotionally sensitive as usual, so you're willing to go to the mat if necessary.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
