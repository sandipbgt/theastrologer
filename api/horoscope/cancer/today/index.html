    "horoscope": "You may notice today that it's harder than usual to make a natural emotional connection with your spouse, a friend or anyone else. You're such a feeling person, and you're also quite sensitive to fluctuations in other people's feelings. Someone you're close to may seem distant or hesitant. If so, give them space. They're probably just preoccupied with some idea they're formulating, or a project they're working on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
