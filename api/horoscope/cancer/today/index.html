    "horoscope": "A shy mood settles in today. Being around strangers is okay, especially if it's business-related: Then you have an agenda to follow. But you may be reserved in how you express yourself, with friends and strangers alike. And that's just fine. You're sure to make a good impression, because you're so calm and polite. You're projecting an aura of skill and competence that makes others feel secure around you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
