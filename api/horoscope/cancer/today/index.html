    "horoscope": "Today, you might unconsciously use other people toward your own ends, but no one will mind. They believe in what you're working toward, too. Plus, they're impressed by your creative approach, and they want to see just how you do it. Rely on your instincts now, because they won't steer you wrong. You're relaxed and centered, which enables you to accomplish something important. You could even put away a little extra cash at the end of the day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
