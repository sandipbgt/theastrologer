    "horoscope": "Your natural leadership skills are highlighted today. You're focused on a goal, and you have a good idea of how to reach it. Just make sure you're accommodating toward others if you have to work with a team, or if you need support from someone to get any step accomplished. Though you're a compassionate person by nature, the current influence might make you less sensitive than usual to others' feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
