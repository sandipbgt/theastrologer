You don't mind having what others might consider a dull day. You just want to feel safe, so draw inspiration from quiet, soothing sources, while other people party on. If you feel like moving outside your comfort zone, you'll be welcomed. So either way, you're home free!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
