    "horoscope": "Focus is usually one of your strong points, but today it's elusive at best. Lots of different ideas are crowding your mind, and as soon as you start one project, another catches your attention. You may not work as effectively as usual, but there's not much you can do about it. Tomorrow, your focus will return. For today, you'll just have to handle being somewhat scattered and restless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
