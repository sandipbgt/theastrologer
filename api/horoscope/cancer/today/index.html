Still, even if you want all the glory for yourself, be sure to stay open to other people's input. Making this a group effort will really improve its chances of success, because right now you can gain more inspiration from working with others than from working on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
