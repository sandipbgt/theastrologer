If you find yourself enmeshed in an argument about the big stuff -- morals, values, ethics -- take a step back to gain a broader view. Instead of getting all heated up over specific issues that are meaningful to you, adopt a fresher, more inclusive perspective. That might help you find common ground with the other side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
