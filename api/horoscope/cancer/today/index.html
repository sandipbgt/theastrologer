    "horoscope": "Everybody in your life is under your watchful eye today, whether they realize it or not. In most cases, you like to protect your friends, family and other associates. In some cases, however, you're checking people out to see what they're up to. And you're right to question someone's sudden luck. Honest work makes more sense to you. On the other hand, if opportunity knocks, don't waste too much time being suspicious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
