    "horoscope": "Your business or romantic partner's feelings are a bit bruised today. You're generally so sensitive to others' feelings, and you certainly don't want to hurt anyone -- but could this be at least partly your fault? In your own mind, you may be in the right.

Even if you don't think you've done or said anything wrong, listen anyway, and apologize.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
