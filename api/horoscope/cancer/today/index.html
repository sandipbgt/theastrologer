    "horoscope": "Hosting people at your house is a good idea today, because you're in a homey mood, and you want everyone to be comfortable. Tap into your nurturing side by making good food for everyone. Plump the cushions on the couch so there's a nice place for people to sit. These little touches apply if you spend the day alone, too, you know. Treating yourself as a treasured guest is just as important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
