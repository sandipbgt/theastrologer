    "horoscope": "You're in quite the talkative mood today, aren't you? Normally you may not be very chatty, since you find kind gestures to be  more meaningful, and besides, it can be tough to talk about your feelings. But  not now. All it takes is one good question and you're off, racing along a mile a minute. And you'll be happy to talk about anything under the, because focus is limited for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
