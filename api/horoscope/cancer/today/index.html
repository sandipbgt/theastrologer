    "horoscope": "Like a hot pack or the perfect mug of coffee, maternal instinct warms your world today. Your temperate climate is heating up, but in a good way. Here in the arms of love, you'll have every chance to manifest positive changes, whether in your life, someone else's, or in the world at large. To use this moment well, you might have to seize opportunities without warning or permission. Anyone with a heart will forgive you once they see what you're up to. And anyone without a heart will grow a new one by the time you're finished with them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
