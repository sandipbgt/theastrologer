    "horoscope": "You might be unsure of yourself today. That would explain the shifty gaze and evasive answers. And if you don't know what to expect from others, you might be easily offended when your guard is down. Sure, there are all kinds of things that will rub you the wrong way, but it's probably not as personal as you think. People have their reasons, and most of those reasons have nothing to do with you. What you need is a little stress reduction in the form of a friendly back rub or good hug.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
