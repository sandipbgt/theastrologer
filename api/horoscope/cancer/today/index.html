    "horoscope": "The world is in a highly emotional space today. For some, this is a vulnerable state to be in, but not you. You actually gain strength from being so in touch with your feelings, and with others' emotions as well. It's easy to read people now, because you're connecting at the heart level instead of just with your mind. You're in a great position to give someone kind, loving advice or strong support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
