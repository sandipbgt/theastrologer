    "horoscope": "Be sure to seek out affectionate moments with loved ones today. If you're romantically attached, tenderness could flare slowly into something more exciting. But even platonic affirmations of warmth and love are thrilling now, as they let you know why you're here -- to connect with others at the heart level. If today could last forever, you'd live happily in the bliss of togetherness. But since this tuned-in feeling won't last forever, make it count now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
