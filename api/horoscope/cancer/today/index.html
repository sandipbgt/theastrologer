    "horoscope": "You can be a source of inspiration for others today, simply by being yourself. You're a true leader, you know. Even if you don't always exhibit this quality in a public forum, your friends and family know how strong you are. And today, other people get a glimpse of your solid backbone, too. They can also see your lighthearted, fun-loving side. What a great balance!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
