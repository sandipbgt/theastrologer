    "horoscope": "Your heart is normally what leads you, but today your mind is extra clear, sharp and strong as well. This makes you a double-threat at the office, at school or anyplace else that requires your insight and understanding. It's easy to analyze details, or get right to the bottom line. This is all about knowing what's important and what isn't, so you can get straight to the heart of the matter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
