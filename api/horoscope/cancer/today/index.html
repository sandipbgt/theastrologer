    "horoscope": "Yes, you're obviously the sum of your experiences. Nobody's arguing about that. But while the past matters, don't get too attached to it. Avoiding confrontation with the present might seem like a safe strategy, but that could start a chain of events you may not want triggered. Want to take control of your life? Then take a day to see where you're going. It's the only way to become the master of your own destiny. If your promising future starts to resemble your glory days, let it take shape organically instead of forcing yourself back into a mold that no longer fits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
