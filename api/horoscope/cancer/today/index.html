    "horoscope": "Values and principles are highlighted today. One of your deepest beliefs may be challenged by someone in conversation, or perhaps by something you see with your own eyes. This could be a tough experience, but it's not one you should try to avoid. How can you be secure in your beliefs if they're never tested? You could learn something new, or your views could be reaffirmed. Either process is valuable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
