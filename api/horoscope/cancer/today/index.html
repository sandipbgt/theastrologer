    "horoscope": "You're frugal with your praise today, and short on courtesy. You might even claim you don't care what other people think, but deep down, you care a lot about how your friends and loved ones see you. It's time to get this in balance. If someone criticizes you today, don't run and hide, or take it personally. Consider whether there's a bit of truth in what they say, and use it as constructive advice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
