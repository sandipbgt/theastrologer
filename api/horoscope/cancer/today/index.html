    "horoscope": "Keep a firm grip on all those healthy habits and traditions. Practice good nutrition and personal cleanliness on all levels, even the ones where food or soap won't realistically go. Because this isn't just about taking care of your body. It's part of something bigger, like not losing your social or spiritual cool in a tense situation. See where this is going? What someone else calls a figure of speech could easily become a way of life for you. Symbolism can work in the real world if you think about it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
