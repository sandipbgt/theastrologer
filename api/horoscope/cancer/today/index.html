    "horoscope": "Since you're sensitive to shifts in your relationships, you may notice a cooling off in one of your close connections today. If so, avoid taking it personally or blowing it out of proportion. Many people need space under the current cosmic influence. If nothing else, they need time to think, to process their ideas and perceptions. If that comes out in the form of emotional detachment, know that it is temporary.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
