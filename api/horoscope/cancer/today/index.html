    "horoscope": "Today you'll stay busy observing and reflecting upon the goings-on around you. Be sure to take special notice of the slow seesaw of cause and effect. One action or decision leads to another, which leads to a particular conclusion -- which may or may not be what you originally had in mind. Ask yourself what hand you play in any little dramas that arise throughout the day. If you had something to do with it, help fix it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
