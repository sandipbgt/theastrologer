For instance, why do you favor isolation over communication? You're just asking a cold, lonely day if you keep walking those deserted paths while everyone else has already found a place inside. But it's not as if you're miles away. You're only separated from them by a wall of your own creation. Reach out right now. Step through one of those open doors. Be warm and included.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
