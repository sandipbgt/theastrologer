    "horoscope": "Get ready for an uncomfortable mood, or several of them today. Life may feel like a roller coaster. Whatever you do, don't make any hasty decisions. You're operating under some very tricky energy at the moment, and you're reacting to life emotionally instead of rationally. Any moves you make today could turn out to be the wrong ones, so just sit tight. It's better than acting rashly and then regretting it later. Focus on what's best rather than what's fastest or what will create the biggest impression.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
