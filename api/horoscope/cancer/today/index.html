    "horoscope": "You're even more deeply in touch with your emotional side today than usual. That's saying a lot, since you're a feeling person by nature. But life becomes extra subjective now. An embrace  warms you to the depths of your soul. A beautiful song brings tears to your eyes. This is a very special state to be in. It reminds you of what's most important in life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
