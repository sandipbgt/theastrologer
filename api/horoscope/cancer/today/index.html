    "horoscope": "Today, life urges you to leave the comfort of familiarity behind, at least for a day. Challenge yourself to embrace unfamiliar people and experiences.

That's why the current energy is so valuable: It pushes you to broaden your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
