    "horoscope": "Uh-oh. There's that nose in theagain. There's that disapproving look on your face. You're about to extend you claws and say something catty, aren't you? Retract and remain aloof. To use another animal kingdom metaphor, waspish outbursts will invite stinging retorts today. But either way, quiet or noisy, reexamine your behavior.
