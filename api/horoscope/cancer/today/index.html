It just doesn't feel right to be so guarded. And what are you trying so hard to protect, anyway? Whatever it is, when it comes down to it, it's better just to come clean. You'll feel so much more lighthearted when you do. It's okay to own your truth, even if it's a little bit tarnished.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
