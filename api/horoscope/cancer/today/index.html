    "horoscope": "Stick close to home today, if you can. You're in the mood for familiar comforts such as the company of your family or roommates. Cook a family recipe that has been passed down to you from your relatives. If there's housework to be done, completing it will give you more than a sense of accomplishment. You'll feel as if you've made your home a more peaceful, harmonious place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
