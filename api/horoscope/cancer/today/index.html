    "horoscope": "If you're involved in a relationship of any sort, today could present some beautiful and intense moments for you and your partner -- or you could find yourselves locked in a battle that's both overwhelming and confusing. Obviously, you should strive for the former! Focus on what you love and respect about each other. If you're on your own, turn that sense of love and trust toward yourself. Create positive energy by honoring yourself,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
