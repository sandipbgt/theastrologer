    "horoscope": "A sense of emotional stability makes life calm and serene today. You feel equipped to handle whatever might be on your agenda for the day, even if you have many tedious to-dos ahead of you. You'll work in a steady, practical manner, proceeding step by step until you've finished what you set out to do. That measured approach works well now, and it affords you a real sense of accomplishment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
