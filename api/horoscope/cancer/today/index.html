    "horoscope": "Your closest connections could use some attention today. This includes personal relationships, such as the bonds you share with a relative or a friend. It also refers to professional connections with a business partner or anyone else with whom you work closely. Getting along is emphasized now. It's a great time to talk through any disagreements you've been having. Both sides will make the effort to find common ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
