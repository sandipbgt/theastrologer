    "horoscope": "Togetherness and harmony are even more important today than usual. But any feelings of irritation or resentment lurking beneath the surface of your relationships could mar an otherwise lovely day. Bottling up your feelings rarely works out. You have to process them in your own way, whether that means talking them out or withdrawing until you feel better. Just remember to choose your battles. Sometimes, closeness is more important than bringing up old issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
