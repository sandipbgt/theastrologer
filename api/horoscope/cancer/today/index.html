    "horoscope": "You're feeling things deeply today, both sweet emotions and difficult ones. The best use of today's intense energy is for connecting with the people you love best -- those friends and family members whom you trust implicitly and love from the bottom of your heart. Lean on these people today,. And try not to attach any importance to other people's emotional outbursts. You're sensitive by nature, but you don't have to absorb their negativity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
