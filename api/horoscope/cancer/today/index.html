    "horoscope": "Your compassion swells today like a river after a rain. You have so much tenderness and caring within you that it leaks out, drenching everyone nearby. Others can benefit from your nurturing energy. So can strangers you smile at as you walk down the street, or someone for whom you hold the door. These little acts of kindness add up to a lot of goodwill, and that's powerful medicine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
