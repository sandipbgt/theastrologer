Everyone's getting under your skin, maybe because you're tired out after recent events. Even going out with friends doesn't sound appealing. You'd just as soon curl up with a good book. Do whatever feels right. Soon you'll come out again and grace the world with your presence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
