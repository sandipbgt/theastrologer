    "horoscope": "Civilization is too much with you now. Walls and straight lines are making you apprehensive. So much for appreciating architecture and urban planning. What's up with all this wildness, anyway? You're a free spirit in need of some elbow room, or a hunted animal trying to escape the hounds?
