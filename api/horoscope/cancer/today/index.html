    "horoscope": "You feel secure within yourself, which lets you take a step outside your usual way of life and do something a little different. Go shopping at an international store today, buy a gift with a foreign flavor for someone you care about, or cook a new dish.

It's healthy to stretch yourself, especially when you feel safe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
