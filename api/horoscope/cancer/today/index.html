    "horoscope": "These are sentimental times. Today everyone here is like family. That can be good or bad, depending on how you feel and function around your actual family. It's great to care about so many and cut them a lot of slack. It's not so great to know someone so well that you can only see them through the filter of a troubled relationship. All that infighting could distract you from your real purpose. If you need to be clear on this, maybe you need to be alone for a while.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
