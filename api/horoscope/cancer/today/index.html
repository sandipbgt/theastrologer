    "horoscope": "Your intuition is highlighted today. You sense what others are thinking and feeling, which is both a blessing and a challenge. You're such a nurturer by nature that you can't help but get involved when you sense someone is feeling hurt, scared or alone. You can be a great source of comfort to them. But it's also tough to take on others' burdens. Do your best to strike a self-protective balance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
