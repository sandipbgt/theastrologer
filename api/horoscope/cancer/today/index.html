    "horoscope": "Sometimes you hold your feelings inside, or only talk them out with close, trusted friends. But other times, like now, you're a verbal force in an otherwise silent world. You know what you want to say, for once, and how to say it. Concentrate on a single message, so that everyone else gets what you're going on about. In fact, you're better off developing your approach and planning your speech for the next day or two, and then presenting your piece. People are more likely to listen once you've really done your homework.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
