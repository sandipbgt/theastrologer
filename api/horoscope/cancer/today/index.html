    "horoscope": "Tempers could flare today. That includes your own. It's hard to stay calm under the current energy. Especially since it seems as if people aren't being nearly as kind or tactful as they should! That may be true, but it's also possible that you're overreacting. That's easy to do right now. Your mind jumps to conclusions and then your mouth takes over. Maybe this is a good opportunity to develop a thicker skin!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
