    "horoscope": "Making a close, warm connection with others feels difficult today. You're seeking a sense of familiarity, but it's hard for you to relate to people. They're caught up in odd theories or activities that make you anxious. But why reject people or ideas just because they seem strange? Instead, try to view uncomfortable conversations as learning experiences. Whatever makes you nervous reveals a lot more about you than about them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
