Be aware that results may vary today, no matter how stellar your intentions might be. But that's okay. You won't let that stop you. People still need your kindness, even when they're not in social mode. Keep trying to reach out to them. You just might find someone who truly needs a strong shoulder to lean on. Keep up the good work; in a few days' time, you'll be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
