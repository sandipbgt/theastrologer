    "horoscope": "You're a curious mixture of dynamic and placid. On the one hand, your usual, passive nature is still present. On the other hand, you're energized by a deep, internal wellspring of strength, one that sharpens both your desires and your focus. If what you want is money or fame, who knows? If you've got your eye on someone special, today could cement your connection or kick the relationship up to the next level. But will any of this make you happy? That remains to be seen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
