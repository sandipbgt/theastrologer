    "horoscope": "Why let the little things offend you? Why defend your vanity? That makes about as much sense as starting a feud over which band or soft drink you prefer. Because unless you're actually employed by that band or soft drink company, it's mostly about who shouts loudest or blinks last. And that's playground thinking. Find better uses for your energy today. Choose a more constructive path toward a more worthwhile goal. Start believing in something that you can actually share with the people you like, or with strangers who have potential.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
