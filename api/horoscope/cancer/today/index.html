    "horoscope": "The world feels a little chilly today. Your instinct is to draw your loved ones together and protect them from life's harsh elements. And you're sensitive enough that even minor hardships make you nervous. But life isn't so uncertain as all that. And you're more adaptable than you give yourself credit for. It's smart to be prepared, but don't let your worries overwhelm you. Most of them never happen anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
