    "horoscope": "Today your emotions are steady and grounded. Isn't it nice to feel this calm, centered and sure of yourself? Come what may, you can handle it gracefully. You make focused efforts look easy. Your serene energy might position you as the capable one in any group -- the person others look to for comfort, guidance or support. That's okay. That's a role you can inhabit almost without thinking!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
