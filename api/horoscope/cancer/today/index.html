    "horoscope": "No matter what's going on today, honesty is still the best policy. Of course, you can use your innate compassion to soften the blow, especially if you have to reveal a harsh truth to a friend. Be as upfront as you can. By telling the truth, you'll protect your integrity, which is very important now. Later, a little exaggeration will be just fine. But for now, stick to the facts and nothing but. You'll be glad you didn't fudge even the tiniest detail.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
