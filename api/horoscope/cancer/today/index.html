But who says you're naive or unskilled? That's not what's going on here at all. You're just in a thoughtful mood, and that's as it should be. Take this brief period to reflect on how things are going with a new project or relationship. Don't pressure yourself to achieve anything or make anything in particular happen. You can strut your stuff when you're ready, but for now, take it easy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
