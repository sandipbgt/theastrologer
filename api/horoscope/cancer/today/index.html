    "horoscope": "Traditional creative methods appeal to you. You like knowing there's a history behind what you're doing, whether it's baking a time-honored recipe or creating a work of art. This is a good day for learning a new artistic technique or trying your hand at a new type of cuisine. If taking some classes or purchasing supplies is in order, don't be afraid to splurge. Check your budget, see what you can afford, and then have fun bringing something new into the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
