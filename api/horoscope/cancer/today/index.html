If any parts of your existence are in need of repair, why not start now? You've got the energy you need to make some very positive changes, and you're extra creative now, with new solutions to old issues. Your friends will be very impressed with the new you. So don't sit around today. It's time to do something meaningful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
