    "horoscope": "You may be famous for your rapidly changing moods. For once, you're also keeping your sense of humor about you. So life didn't give you a fair shake. Why get mad about it? You'll probably be wry and contemplative today, and that's perfectly appropriate. You can go over what happened and figure out what you could do differently next time. In fact, think of this as a time for planning and reorganizing. That way, instead of declaring yourself a failure, maybe you'll try again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
