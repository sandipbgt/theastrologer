    "horoscope": "Life could get pretty emotional today. For you, this is a very pleasant state to be in. You're already deeply in touch with your physical self, and now you're in touch with your feelings, too. You feel wonderfully integrated, and life is poignant in all its facets. Even if you're feeling a little melancholy, it's nice to indulge in life's bittersweet quality. This helps you to connect more truly with other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
