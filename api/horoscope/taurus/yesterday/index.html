    "horoscope": "You're feeling passive -- just calm and accepting of the state of things. Isn't it nice to get a break from striving and yearning? Best of all, your attention is keen and your mind lucid. But you don't have to just lie back and float through the day. You could put your currently extra-sharp eye to use, perhaps by writing or studying. Or you could make someone feel extra special with some lavish, careful attention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
