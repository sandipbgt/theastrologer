    "horoscope": "Expect a gentle, emotionally satisfying day. You can take a more relaxed attitude toward your task list than you normally do. Oh, you'll still get more done than seems humanly possible -- but you'll be so calm about it, no one will realize what you're up to until you're already finished! Don't forget to enjoy some earthly pleasures today, such as a good meal, a shoulder rub or a long, warm shower.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
