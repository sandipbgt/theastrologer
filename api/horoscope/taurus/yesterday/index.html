    "horoscope": "It's a great day to take it easy. You're in a placid mood, and spending time with loved ones feels extra special. You're fine on your own, too. Being alone gives you a chance to catch up on your sleep or your reading. Make mental or physical work easy instead of vigorous. It's not that you can't handle it. You're just in the mood for comfort and ease.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
