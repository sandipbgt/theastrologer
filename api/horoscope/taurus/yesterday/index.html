    "horoscope": "You tend to be quiet, but that's not all you're about. Given the right circumstances, you can get extremely chatty. It's okay if you slip into chatty mode today. You know a lot about many different things -- the result of your long hours of studying the practical realities of the world. Therefore, when you talk, other people listen for good information and interesting anecdotes. Have fun chatting them up today. Everyone's in the mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
