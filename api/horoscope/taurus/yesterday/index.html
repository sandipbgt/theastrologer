    "horoscope": "Do you still care what the neighbors think? Are your future employers still doing a background check? Sure, there's that whole thing about showing good breeding instead of coarse manners, but enough's enough. However much you pretty it up, you're still an animal. So don't be too aloof when you're hungry. Help yourself instead of waiting to be served. Otherwise, you can expect a day of friction between desire and denial. It's a lot harder to get down-and-dirty when you're up there in your royal tower. Surrender soon, please, and have the fun you deserve.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
