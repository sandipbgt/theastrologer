    "horoscope": "It's time to enjoy friends and family. Your pleasurable mood makes that easy, but given your generous, self-indulgent nature, it's also easy to go overboard now, especially if you expose yourself to temptation in the form of delicious treats or a trip to the mall with your credit card in tow. Practice some self-restraint, if possible. If you do eat or spend too much, resolve to make up for it soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
