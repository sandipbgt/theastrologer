    "horoscope": "This is no time to let your anxieties get the best of you. Instead of losing your nerve or running away from your problems, face them head-on. Summon all your honesty and courage. Remember, you have a strong back as well as a strong will, and you can handle this issue, whatever it might be. Take it as an ideal chance to express yourself clearly and directly. This could be a very good lesson in assertiveness training, or in cooperating with a partner.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
