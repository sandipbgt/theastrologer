Reach into your heart and find the part of yourself that's generous and loving. Draw on it today and it will ease you through what could be some be tense, judgmental moments. Everyone will thank you for it once this bad mood passes and you don't have to try so hard to be nice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
