    "horoscope": "Staying upbeat throughout this interesting, complex day shouldn't be difficult. Your mind moves ahead quickly, and you're open to new people and interesting conversations. Of course, too many distractions in the form of social activity or an overstuffed agenda could leave you feeling jumpy. Combat restlessness with deep breaths or ten minutes of meditation before bedtime. Then you'll be able to get to sleep!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
