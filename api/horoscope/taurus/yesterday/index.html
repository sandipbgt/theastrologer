But make sure you aren't quarrelsome when brainstorming with a group. You just want what's best for everyone: ideas with a solid foundation, or a practical plan that's going to work. It's all in how you go about achieving that goal. Listen carefully as well as talking, and consider everyone's ideas equally.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
