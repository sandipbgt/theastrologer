    "horoscope": "It's important to keep the peace today. This shouldn't be too difficult for you, since you're in a warmly affectionate mood. You don't want tension or conflict any more than anyone else does. Just be aware if you slip into a stubborn mood. In most cases, it's more important to get along than to take a stand. On the other hand, be firm if you have to. This is about choosing your battles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
