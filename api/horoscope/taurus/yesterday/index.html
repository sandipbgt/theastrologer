    "horoscope": "You're struggling with a big question today: Are you a leader or a follower? Your path seems unclear, and if there's one thing you can't stand, it's being stuck in the limbo of indecision. Part of you wants to work with other people, but another part wants to do things your own way. Hurry up and decide how you're going to handle things. Otherwise, events will unfold on their own and cast you in a different role. And isn't it better to decide on your own than to have that kind of decision made for you?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
