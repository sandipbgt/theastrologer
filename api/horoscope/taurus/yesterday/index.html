Whatever's happening, though, you can't just blame it on cause and effect. You play a crucial part in every relationship or argument in your life, and you're in control of your reactions to other people's behavior. Stop blaming others, and take responsibility for your own comments and actions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
