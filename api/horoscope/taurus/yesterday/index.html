    "horoscope": "Physically, your energy may be soft today. But emotionally, you should be quite grounded and centered. You're feeling kindly toward yourself and other people. It's wonderful to have this kind of compassionate attitude toward your own weaknesses or someone else's. This is the kind of gentle perspective that builds your connection with friends and family. It's a very good day for bridging any gap between yourself and someone you love.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
