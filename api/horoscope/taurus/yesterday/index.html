For today, nothing can rattle your temper, which frees you up to focus on the areas of your life that really mean something to you. You know that all the little stuff will work itself out in the meantime. So call up an old friend or a relative you haven't spoken to in a while, give your child or spouse an extra-long hug, or take a step beyond just waving to your neighbor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
