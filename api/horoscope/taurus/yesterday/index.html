Digging your heels in and insisting on getting your way won't get you anywhere. It's much better to relax and give in on a few points. That way, the other person is more likely to give in a little, too, and you'll meet up somewhere sweet in the middle.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
