    "horoscope": "If your yen for comfort foods kicks in today, it doesn't have to be a bad thing. Your body is simply responding to the current influence, which is highly emotional in nature. Like a lot of people right now, you crave the comfort of familiarity, including familiar flavors. So go ahead and make that recipe that's been passed down in your family. Share it with people you love. Keep the tradition alive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
