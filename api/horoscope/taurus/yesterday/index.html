You're quite sentimentally connected to your loved ones and the places where you feel most comfortable. Home -- whether that's your place of residence, a dear friend's house, or anyplace that holds great meaning for you -- is a safe haven. Spend as much delicious, relaxing time there as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
