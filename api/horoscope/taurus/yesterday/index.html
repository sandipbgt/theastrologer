    "horoscope": "Your level head has everyone fooled -- well, most people, anyway. Those who know you best know there's a churning well of innate power inside you. That passion is bubbling even closer to the surface now than usual, so you should channel it to make something positive happen. A relationship may take off or a move in a new, exciting direction. When this happens, expect your creativity and intuition to roar to life, Taurus.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
