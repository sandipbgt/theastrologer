That's because you're even more stubborn than usual, Taurus, and you might come across as more difficult than you realize. As tenacious as you are, you should still consider backing off a bit today. Cooperation counts for a lot now. You should be working to preserve your partnerships, not test them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
