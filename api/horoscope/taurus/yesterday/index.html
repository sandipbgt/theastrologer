    "horoscope": "A tranquil mood makes your day quite pleasant. You might spend the day in thoughtful reflection, or you might simply let your mind wander where it will.

Normally you're so grounded and practical, but right now you're as fanciful as a poet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
