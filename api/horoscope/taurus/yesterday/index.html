    "horoscope": "You're in a pompous and indulgent mood today, as if you think you're royalty -- minus the wealth and power, of course. And you do deserve the best life has to offer, but doesn't everyone? In the end, we're all the same. You need to find some humility, fast, before you alienate everyone with your superior attitude. Maybe lending some time and energy to someone less fortunate than you will help adjust your outlook. Volunteer at a soup kitchen, nursing home or animal shelter, and feel your karma improve immediately.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
