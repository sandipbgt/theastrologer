You like to be the star of your own world, and so does everyone else -- especially today. So back off a little, and let your friends, family and coworkers find their own way of doing things. You can give advice if someone asks for it, but beyond that, lead by example.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
