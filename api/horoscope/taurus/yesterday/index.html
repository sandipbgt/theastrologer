    "horoscope": "Be brave without taking stupid risks. Be thoughtful without over-thinking. Be professional without leaving the human touch out in the cold. As soon as you bring a little bit of self-control online, these things won't be so hard. And get a grip on a few other critical details while you're at it, because you could actually manage this situation like a pro today. Others will gladly do your bidding as long as you ask nicely. They'll be even happier if you pay them for their services, of course, but for now take things one step at a time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
