Clearly you're one of the boys or girls, depending on your gender affinity, but you could be a lot more dignified, too. Appeal to refined tastes instead of tickling base urges today. Enlighten instead of flashing. Amuse without abusing. No matter what the marketing people and the pollsters say, being subtle is the way to go. Your audience will like you even more when you don't insult their intelligence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
