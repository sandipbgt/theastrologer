    "horoscope": "Be more attentive to the ways of nature. You know, the birds, the bees, all that stuff? Lower your voice, step away from the hum of civilization and listen to rain falling on leaves or lizards skittering across sunlit rocks. Stop and smell the roses even while you're going somewhere. You might have to lean over someone's property line to do it, but so what? You're not stealing anything. You're just learning all you can in one day's time. The more you know about this world, the more easily you'll move through it. You didn't think you owned the place, did you?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
