    "horoscope": "Welcome to a smooth, grounded day. You aren't concerned with your own needs or desires. You feel pretty comfortable, and there isn't much lacking in your life right now. So turn your attention toward other people. Work hard for your clients or employer, or give good advice to a friend who could use your levelheaded perspective. Being in service to the world is virtuous, and it makes you feel good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
