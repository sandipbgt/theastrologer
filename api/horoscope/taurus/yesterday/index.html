    "horoscope": "Many people are in the mood for closeness and cooperation today, and that certainly includes you. The last thing you want is to start an argument or take a difficult stand, especially if it would cause tension with someone you care about. But make sure you don't let anyone take advantage of you. Harmonious relationships are worth working for, but not if they come at too high a price.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
