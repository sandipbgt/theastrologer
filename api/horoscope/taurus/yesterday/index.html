    "horoscope": "This is one of those days when everyone around you seems high-energy, happy-go-lucky, confident and free. And you want to join in the fun, but mild feelings of insecurity could interfere. If your sweetheart needs space today, don't let it worry you. The world is enjoying an exuberant vibe right now. You might have fun striking out on your own path for a while, yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
