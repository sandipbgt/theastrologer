    "horoscope": "Compassion abounds today. You're sympathetic toward everyone you meet, and your big heart swells to encompass the whole world. Your generous streak broadens now in a big way. You just want to give back, because you know you're blessed! Try not to overextend yourself in terms of time, effort or money. Being realistic about what resources you can actually afford helps you give more wholeheartedly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
