    "horoscope": "Yes, you have carnal needs and desires. Most people do, even if you can't imagine anyone else feeling like this. One minute you're a god, the next you're an animal. First you're living inside a work of art, and then you're losing yourself in the chaos of a random universe. Maybe you'll feel uncertain about where you stand today. Maybe you won't get a hit on what's going on with the object of your needs and desires. Just be yourself, OK? Either it'll happen or it won't. And maybe you'll move on to something better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
