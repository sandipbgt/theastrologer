But you're too warm to miss the distinct cooling off that happens under the current energy. Maybe your favorite people are suddenly aloof or unavailable, wrapped up in their own pursuits. Trust that they'll tune in again when they're ready.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
