    "horoscope": "Watch that stubborn streak of yours today. You may be called on to compromise or make nice in some way, and the best thing you can do will be to smile and get along, no matter what you're thinking or feeling inside. And really, is it that tough to give someone a little ground? It shouldn't be, because you all have the same goal: to cooperate and respect each other. Try to embody these values today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
