    "horoscope": "Your mind is working double-time today. One fast-paced thought builds on another. It's a good idea to keep a notebook or voice recorder nearby, so you can record any strokes of brilliance. This is perfect if you're in the planning stages of a project. You're extra creative now, and not as limited as usual by issues of practicality. You can worry later about whether your ideas will hold.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
