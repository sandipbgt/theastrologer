    "horoscope": "Today is about hard work, since you have the stamina needed to concentrate your efforts. But you should play just as hard. To miss out on the pleasure of the current influence would be a real shame! It's a great day to enjoy the company of friends and loved ones, or to spend time in the great outdoors if the weather is fine. Connecting with the natural world centers you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
