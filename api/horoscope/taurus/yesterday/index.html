    "horoscope": "Today brings a substantial energy boost, raising your spirits and spurring your determination. You can get a lot accomplished, purely because you're so physically and mentally vigorous. You're also inspired, and more willing than usual to take chances. That's backed up by your practical nature, which rarely allows you to jump into anything without some forethought. Thus, you should be able to calculate which chances are advantageous and which are better avoided.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
