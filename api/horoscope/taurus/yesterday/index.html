But if you feel a little grouchy around the edges, remember that you don't have to give in to it. Stave off a bad mood by seeking innovative approaches to old problems. Knowing you can try something brand-new instead of sticking to the same old, same old, will make you feel good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
