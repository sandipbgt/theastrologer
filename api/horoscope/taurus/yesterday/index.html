You live here, you're part of it, so you might as well take a seat at the town hall meeting. Call it theater if that gets you in the door. You might have to watch for a while anyway before participating. Pay attention when someone proposes a new way out of the mess. Normally you'd close your mind to such ideas. But today you'll find that necessity overrides dogma. And who knows? You might just try something a little different this time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
