    "horoscope": "Living up to your responsibilities? Not a problem -- not today. You're in your element, which means you're extra sensible about goals and resources. Budget your time and energy, so you won't get stuck taking on too much and then being unable to fulfill your promises. That's the very definition of reliability: following through on what you say you'll do, and being true to your word. That's also the definition of honor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
