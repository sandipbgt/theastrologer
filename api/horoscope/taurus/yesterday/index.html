Honing your strength and perfecting your technique will build your confidence. Soon you'll be back in the thick of things. Then you can impress everyone -- your friends, your boss, your clients -- with the fruits of all that work and inspiration. Today, take it easy. Instead of starting a new project, tie up loose ends on an existing one. This is the perfect time for dedicated detail work. You'll love the results.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
