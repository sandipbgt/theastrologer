    "horoscope": "Something hidden emerges today. You're certainly dealing with some tricky emotions, and when someone challenges you, you may want to try and bring them down. But it's entirely possible that their intentions were innocent and not aimed at you at all. Find out before you act. And remember that it reflects much better on you if you resist any revenge fantasies and instead resolve to forgive and forget.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
