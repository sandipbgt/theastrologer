In fact, this is a perfect day for getting together with the people you love best. You'll lend them support without asking for anything in return. Perhaps this is easy for you because you feel so secure at the moment. Hold on to this feeling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
