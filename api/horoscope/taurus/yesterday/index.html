    "horoscope": "Your generous heart is extra compassionate today. You want to give whatever support and empathy you can to anyone who needs it. You've got a lot of strength to offer. That's a gift right now, when plenty of people aren't feeling so stable. You can be someone's rock -- their steady, dependable friend who is there for them unquestioningly. This doesn't cost you a thing, and it makes both of you feel great.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
