Sure, there are issues to handle and variables to juggle, but you feel equal to the task. Today starts a brand-new, four-week phase of life for you,, so make the most of it. Do what you do best: Work steadily toward a meaningful and attainable goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
