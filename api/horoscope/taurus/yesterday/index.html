If you're preparing a report for work or cleaning your home for a gathering of friends, nothing will escape your notice. It may take a while to get things just the way you want them. But once you're finished, you'll know you did a perfect job.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
