You can put in long hours at the office or studio and still feel fresh and alert at the end of the day. This is even more so if you're passionate about your work. In general, if you're working toward a personally meaningful goal, any amount of effort is worth the trouble. Today, this is doubly true.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
