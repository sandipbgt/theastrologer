    "horoscope": "Set a realistic goal today, and begin working toward it in measured steps. It's also a good time to set a longer-term goal in place, and then plan how you'll reach it. Think forward several weeks. What will you need in order to accomplish something important? Aim high, but stay practical. Part of making a feasible plan is knowing your limits. It's a good thing you have a solid handle on that now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
