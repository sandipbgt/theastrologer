    "horoscope": "Today you're an employer's or client's dream. You're thorough in your work, from conception and planning through to completion. You know how to do your research and support every action or opinion with grounded evidence. This makes you a desirable addition to any professional project, but these qualities come in handy even if you're just doing your own thing at home. Knowing you'll do a good job is so satisfying!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
