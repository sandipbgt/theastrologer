    "horoscope": "You feel good today, grounded and centered in your body. When you wake up this morning, take a few moments to stretch luxuriously, like a cat in the. In fact, this is a good thing to do periodically all day long, since it keeps you limber and rooted in your physical self. It also helps you keep going, which is important as you apply yourself to a project with renewed focus and dedication.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
