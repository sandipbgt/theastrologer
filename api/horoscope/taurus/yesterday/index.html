    "horoscope": "Whatever you're working on today, don't ignore the simplest answer when snags come up. The easiest route might actually be the best and most realistic one, for once. And you are good at finding the simplest route! Still, if you're working with a team, it could be a trial getting everyone else to understand and go along with your plans. Explain your ideas in clear terms, and don't become impatient if someone doesn't cooperate immediately.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
