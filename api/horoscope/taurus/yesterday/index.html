Whether you're working, talking to a friend or simply reading an article, don't allow old assumptions, prejudices or rigid thinking limit what you can learn, feel or experience. A good rule of thumb is to embrace ideas and experiences that make you uncomfortable. Challenging yourself is a good thing, even if it makes you feel vulnerable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
