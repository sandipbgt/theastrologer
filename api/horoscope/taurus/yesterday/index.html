Well, why can't you go exploring, too? If the idea makes you nervous, that's all the more reason why you should do it. Don't let your insecurities limit you. It's a great day to broaden your boundaries. Challenge yourself to do something new and exciting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
