Fleeting pleasures and social interactions don't interest you now as much as working hard for long-term gain. You have an eye on the future you'd like to create. Keep your gaze steady today. If snags or obstacles arise, work through them smoothly and move on. That's what life is all about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
