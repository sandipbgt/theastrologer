Your sporty good looks don't make you a good sport today. Lighten up to make it through this passionate and uncomfortable period. The way you see things is just one view among many. Soon you may find your urgent agenda isn't as important as you thought.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
