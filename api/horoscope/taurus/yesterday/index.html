You might have the people around you in a state of confusion, but that's okay, as long as it doesn't last too long. Explore your range of expression. Come out of this with a stronger idea of your own needs and desires, and it will be worth it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
