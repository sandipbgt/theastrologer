Somehow the soft breeze of generosity is wafting across you today, and you realize exactly how much you have that you could share. This extends beyond money to time, space and possessions. Rather than hoard these things for yourself, open up your resources to those less fortunate. You'll be doing more good than you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
