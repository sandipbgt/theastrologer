    "horoscope": "Social get-togethers are extra nice today. Everyone is in the mood for peace, harmony and togetherness. No one wants to argue or endure tension. You certainly like things to be easy and fun with your friends and family. Part of keeping the peace is watching your own behavior. You tend to be very easygoing -- that is, until something brings out your stubborn streak. To avoid this, stay mellow and keep an open mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
