Any tension that may recently have been affecting a relationship evaporates. What's left over? Just peace, harmony and togetherness. Connect with loved ones and really pay attention to them, using more than just your eyes and ears. You have an intuitive streak, and it will come out today if you tap into it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
