    "horoscope": "Your emotions stay on an even keel today, which helps to regulate your physical energy, too. This makes it easy to meet any task or challenge you have -- whether it's simple work or family obligations, or something unexpected that comes up last-minute. Be sure to take some time for R&R today, too. You've got a new phase of life ahead of you, and the next four weeks will be busy!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
