    "horoscope": "Today marks the start of a brand-new personal cycle for you, one that will last for the next four weeks. You may sense this special energy infusing your life. You probably feel more grounded and serene. Hard work comes easily. So does relaxation! Make time for both. Focus on a goal, and then use your mind and your muscles to create a solid plan for your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
