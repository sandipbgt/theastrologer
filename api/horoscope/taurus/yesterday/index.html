Your sweet tooth could flare up, and if an extra slice of cake -- or two -- looks good, you'll toss both your diet and your common sense out the window! The same goes for temptations encountered when you're out shopping or having dinner with friends. You'll spring for the entire bill or splurge on a new outfit, whether you can afford it or not. Leave the credit card at home.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
