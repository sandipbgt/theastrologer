    "horoscope": "You're feeling everything more intensely than usual today. And this goes for positive experiences as well as challenging ones. A romantic moment could feel infinitely sweet, but a tense interaction could seem just as infinitely painful. Try to keep a sense of perspective, and stay as grounded as possible. If your feelings are intense, remember that it's only temporary. This should help you stay realistic.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
