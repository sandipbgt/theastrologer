Can you help creating casual miracles as you go? Hardly. Trust in your ability to blend energy, focus and inspiration into something truly incredible. This will be one of those periods when, later, you'll look back at your output and marvel at the quality you produced, with relatively little effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
