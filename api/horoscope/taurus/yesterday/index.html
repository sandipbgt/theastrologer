    "horoscope": "Today, life centers on duty and effort. That may sound a bit grim, but in fact, you enjoy this kind of focus. Your strong, grounded energy enables you to accomplish just about anything you want. Your willingness to plan doesn't hurt, either. Nor does your natural sense of caution, which ensures that you'll take only smart risks. Don't be surprised if you've moved a mountain by the end of the day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
