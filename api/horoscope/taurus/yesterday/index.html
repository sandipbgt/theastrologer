    "horoscope": "Watch out for stubbornness today. Under the current influence, your opinions are deeply rooted in your emotions, which makes it even tougher than usual to accept ideas or viewpoints that contradict your own. You're tied to your perspective as if it defines who you are at an essential level. That makes it hard to be open and accepting with others. But staying aware of this dynamic helps you consciously work against it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
