Emphasizing your differences only drives you apart. Digging your heels in regarding some issue only polarizes you further. So instead of taking a hard, stubborn stand, dig deep. Find that easygoing charm you normally embody. Use it to build a bridge, and get over it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
