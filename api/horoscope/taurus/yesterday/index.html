Plus, your stubborn streak is highlighted. You might put your foot down about something and then later realize you were being silly. But in the moment, there's no convincing you to back down and cool off! Try to keep a sense of perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
