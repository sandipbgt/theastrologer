    "horoscope": "Your mood and energy are solid, and you feel capable of handling anything that comes your way. Keep your story line credible. This won't be any trouble, because you're infused with plain, grounded honesty, and nothing fosters harmony better than a shared belief in the truth. You can have anyone eating out of your hand today, if that's what you want. This is the perfect time to push forward on a pet project, because you possess the energy and focus to accomplish something important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
