    "horoscope": "Pursue with due diligence. Be circumspect and consistent with your questions. When you put it that way, you start sounding like a lawyer or therapist. But even if you're not in the same professional ballpark, taking on some of those qualities might play well in your actual line of work, don't you think? Because, whatever tax bracket you're in, whatever color shirt you wear, whether you call people clients, customers, sir, ma'am or 'hey, you,' today will be about jobs well done, and feeling good that you did them well. Everyone works and everyone wins.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
