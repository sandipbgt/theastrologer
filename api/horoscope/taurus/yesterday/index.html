If you stay attuned to other people's feelings and needs, you'll stay soft. It's when you start getting wrapped up in your own problems that stubbornness sets in. When you start insisting on having your way, the situation just devolves from there. That's a dynamic that's better avoided!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
