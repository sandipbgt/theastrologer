No matter how badly you want it, no matter how entitled you feel, don't reach out and take anything without getting permission first. Some self-restraint is in order today, despite the fact that you're all about indulgence. Resisting the urge to have that person or thing you desire could be a really good life lesson.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
