    "horoscope": "Your energy is up today. You're probably feeling just a little bit frisky! Instead of moving along at your usual, steady pace, you're pushing forward in bursts. If you're working on a project requiring physical strength, this cosmic boost should help. Just don't burn out early -- even you, with your stamina. Do your best to measure out your energy rather than using it up in one big shove.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
