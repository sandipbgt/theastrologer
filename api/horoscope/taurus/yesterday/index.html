This isn't a time for taking unnecessary risks or throwing your support behind something you know won't work out long-term. So use your head and tap into the wisdom you already possess inside you. Follow your instincts and you can't go wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
