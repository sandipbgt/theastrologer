Under the current influence, it's likely that they're caught up in some subject or idea they find interesting. Their attention will naturally return to you soon, if you let it. But trying to force a close connection might just make things even more stressful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
