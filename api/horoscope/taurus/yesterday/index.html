It's easy to tackle your agenda since your work ethic is too strong to grumble. You know you can get it all done. Just apply yourself to the task at hand. It's also a great day to launch a new personal project, since your planning skills are especially solid.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
