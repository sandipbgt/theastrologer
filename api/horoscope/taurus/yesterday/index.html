But for the time being, you're okay with waiting for the answers. And besides, you know better than most that patience and hard work make the world a better place. You believe in diligence and dedication, especially now -- and the universe will reward you for your efforts. So buckle down today. Any lingering misgivings will sort themselves soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
