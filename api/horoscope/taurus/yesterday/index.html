    "horoscope": "You have a lot of empathy today, which is apparent to everyone you encounter. You have such a warm, giving nature that under the current influence, it's hard not to extend that kindness to others. That includes strangers. Your compassion is equal opportunity! But unlike some folks, you're practical enough to know when you're going overboard. That helps you protect yourself even as you extend yourself to others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
