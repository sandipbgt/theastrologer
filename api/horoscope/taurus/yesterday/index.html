    "horoscope": "The world is in a playful mood today, and you want to join in the fun. Connect with other friendly people and have a good time, but try to restrain yourself from showboating too much! You love affection and attention, which creates a flair for drama, especially right now. But today's sweet vibe should be shared, not hoarded. Be generous in your attentions, and other people will extend the same to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
