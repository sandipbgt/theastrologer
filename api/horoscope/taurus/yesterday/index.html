The not so good news is that you also have the ambitions of a dictator. Today, listen to your own higher power, whatever that might be. Just don't get things backwards or you may end up with a revolt on your hands. People are always quick to assume things about the state of a dictator's heart, and you'd hate to have them believing all that bad stuff about you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
