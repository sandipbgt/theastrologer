You enjoy your routine, and prefer rules and systems you understand to ones that are challenging in their newness. But today, you might have to cope with new rules or unfamiliar ideas. Instead of rejecting these out of hand, do your best to greet them with a tolerant, accepting attitude. That will help you absorb new information faster.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
