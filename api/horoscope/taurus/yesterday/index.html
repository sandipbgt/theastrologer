    "horoscope": "Your stamina is legendary, and today it receives a boost from the cosmos. This could take you one step closer to a particular goal, since you're working so steadily and efficiently. Be sure to map things out before you act. Right now, measurable progress depends on breaking down a goal into manageable steps. Follow the correct procedure -- one you devised or one set by someone else -- and you can't go wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
