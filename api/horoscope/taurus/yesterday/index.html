    "horoscope": "You may have a hard time staying calm today. Many people are feeling the emotional intensity that's swirling around now. Passions are running high. This can be the fun, exciting kind of passion, but it can also be the difficult, angry kind. These are exactly the circumstances that bring your stubborn streak to the fore. So if you get into it with a friend or coworker, do your best to be reasonable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
