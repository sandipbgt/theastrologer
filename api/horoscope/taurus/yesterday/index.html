    "horoscope": "Pursue quiet activities close to home today. Cooking, baking, gardening and working on your house all make you feel more emotionally centered. There's a close connection now between your feelings and the people and places in your life that are most familiar. So tending to those familiar people and places means tending to yourself on an emotional level. Plus, it's a comfort now to spend time in familiar surroundings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
