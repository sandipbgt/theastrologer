    "horoscope": "Life moves quickly today. You tend to wander along at your own, mellow pace. But now an energy boost quickens your blood and heightens your sense of enthusiasm. You aren't satisfied with the same old routine. You want to change things up and bring some excitement into your daily activities. Good thing you're practical enough not to upset the apple cart in any way that can't be easily remedied!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
