There's nothing wrong with being a practical, steady hand when everyone else is flashy or flaky, but you refuse to be boring. Break out of that old rut today. It won't be hard when everything you do sparkles with culture and class. As long as there's something special about your touch, get things done and do them in style. And be sure to check the mirror from time to time over the next month. Yes, that exciting person really is you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
