However, you should also use your common sense. In other words, don't be the fool who rushes in, but don't be a robot going with the program, either. Take direct action when you believe in something, but take all the necessary precautions, too. With equal measures of sensitivity and sensibility, you can't go wrong today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
