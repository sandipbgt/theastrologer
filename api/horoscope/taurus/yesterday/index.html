    "horoscope": "Your family and friends are very important to you, and today you're extra aware of that fact. If you could reach out and envelop everyone you love in a big hug, you would. But some of your dear ones are far away, so send them an email or a nice note to let them know you're thinking of them. Invite the ones who are nearby over for dinner. Make a feast that everyone can enjoy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
