That passion is bubbling even closer to the surface now than usual, so you should channel it to make something positive happen. A relationship may take off or a move in a new, exciting direction. When this happens, expect your creativity and intuition to roar to life, (c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
