    "horoscope": "It's a great day to show your boss, client or a friend how dependable you are. Your mind is clear and your emotions are calm. You can get a lot accomplished, simply by staying focused. And concentration comes even more easily now than usual. You may have to manage lots of details or multitask like a master juggler, but that isn't difficult. In fact, it's fun. It's like a mental workout!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
