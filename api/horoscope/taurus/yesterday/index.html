    "horoscope": "Showy gestures and grand displays of devotion could easily turn into high drama today. Your heart is in the right place. You just want to let someone know you care for them. But if you don't feel your affections are returned, this could turn into jealousy or possessiveness. If you start feeling upset, take a moment to consider what lies beneath that emotion. Then you can reach out in a more genuine, honest way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
