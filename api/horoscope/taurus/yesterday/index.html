Well, you belong to the people in your community, too. And if you feel good physically and emotionally, today would be a fine time for reaching out. But don't engage everyone with a challenge, because not everyone thinks friendly conflict is fun. Find ways to agree with them. Show more affection so they'll know this is more than a mental exercise. The world deserves you, and you deserve to fit in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
