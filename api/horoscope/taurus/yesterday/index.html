You're perfectly in control of your own power, which means you can do just about anything you put your heart into; but you aren't smug about it. You're generous enough to share the prizes you earn today, and your friends and colleagues will cheer along with you as you rack up even more definitive wins. Yes, everyone's in clover now, and you're on the greenest side of the fence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
