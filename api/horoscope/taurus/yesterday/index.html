Did you leave a trail of bread crumbs to mark your return? Maybe this is the time to start. You'll want to have the option of retracing your steps, especially if you still don't have a plan. Whatever you do, don't resign yourself to the fate of being stuck in the middle of nowhere. That's not going to help anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
