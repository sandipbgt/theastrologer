    "horoscope": "If you've been tending toward self-indulgence lately, whether with food, splurging on material items, or simply relaxing too much, it's time to get back on track. Reining in your spending isn't difficult now, and eating smaller, more healthful portions feels right. Getting down to business brings you satisfaction and a sense of confidence in yourself. And if you're already on track, good for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
