    "horoscope": "Your ideals are glowing like coals in the fire, lit with internal energy. Your heart is pretty warm, too. Isn't that enough for now? You don't have to rush out and convert everyone to your cause. In fact, you don't even have to pursue that cause yourself. Stop pushing; take a break. Today is perfect for resting and regrouping. You can get in some much-needed social time or relaxation. By taking a mini-breather, you'll let them come to you, for once.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
