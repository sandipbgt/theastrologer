As always, it comes down to a question of money, whether it's a personal budget or shared finances. So you should be considering the difference between thrifty and cheap. It's all about how you react to expensive circumstances. You could be wise or you could be mean. Which do you think makes more sense? Don't be small-minded about your goals.
