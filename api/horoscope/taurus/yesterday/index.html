    "horoscope": "Normally your opinions are solid -- some might even say stubborn! But don't be surprised if you change your mind today, more than once. New information keeps surfacing, changing your view of things. And you're more perceptive than usual, so you notice more. That could make it hard to decide what's important and what isn't. Just keep learning and sifting through the details. Soon it will all come together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
