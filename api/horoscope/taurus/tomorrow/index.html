    "horoscope": "Follow your creative instincts today. Your original, inventive mind is working double-time, and so are your hands and feet. With a bit of luck, even your off-the-cuff ideas are likely to be really effective. You shine in business meetings and artistic endeavors alike. Other people will start to believe there's a wee bit of mad genius at work within you. But don't get cocky, and don't take this gift for granted. Your brilliance could still be hit or miss, and you'll still have to put in solid work to support even your best ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
