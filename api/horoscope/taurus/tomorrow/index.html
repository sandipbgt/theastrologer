    "horoscope": "Your emotions are stirred up in a big way today. And when you're upset, you might get stubborn. But insisting on your own point of view won't make it truer. Try to loosen up a little, even if it means admitting that perhaps you misread a situation, or maybe you're just having a bad day. Hey, it happens to everyone. Being able to admit it shows your strength and humility.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
