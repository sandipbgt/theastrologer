    "horoscope": "Today should be fairly mellow. You're feeling on top of things. You don't have a particular need to boast about your successes or overindulge in your favorite sensations or flavors, as you sometimes do. No, you're on an even keel, mindful of your health and your limits. And that very quality could easily turn today into an occasion. Whatever happens, make sure you savor the welcome break from the usual frenzy of life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
