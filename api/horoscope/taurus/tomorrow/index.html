    "horoscope": "You love your money, and you're usually quite sensible about it. But today is different. Suddenly you're investing bullishly in some fanatical cause that you haven't really checked out. Can you handle another day of high risk? Remember that there are no guarantees, and things that sound too good to be true usually are. Use you common sense when dealing with matters that don't seem quite real today. Your practical nature will guide you correctly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
