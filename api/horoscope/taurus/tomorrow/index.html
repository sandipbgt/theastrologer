Only you can say. Maybe pressures at work are getting you down, or maybe it's a friendship or love affair that's on the rocks. Either way, you'll need to take steps to stay cool and collected today. You might just have to fake it till you make it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
