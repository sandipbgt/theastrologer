At a business meeting or at home with your family, you might look around at these people you thought you knew so well, and wonder what's gotten into them. But instead of assuming they're just being wacky, try to find a method to their madness. Get used to their progressive ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
