Sometimes you're a bit stubborn about your own methods and opinions, so it's especially important to go out of your way to accommodate others' views and needs. If you stay mellow and easygoing, working with a partner will go smoothly. Problems shouldn't arise unless you dig your heels in. If you truly think it's important to take a stand, find a calm, fair-minded way to state your case.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
