    "horoscope": "An idealistic mood steals over you today. Flights of fancy occupy your mind. You might be in a very romantic mood, starry-eyed about someone special. Or perhaps your head is just in the clouds. This is certainly a pleasant state of mind, even if it does make you feel a bit tired or spaced out. Get some extra rest, or just let your mind wander.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
