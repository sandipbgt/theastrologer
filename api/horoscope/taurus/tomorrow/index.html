    "horoscope": "Creative inspiration is yours today. At the moment, you're especially attuned to your own, inner life as well as to the people around you. This is a rich source of imaginative energy to tap into. Your dreams are another source. Take a few moments to write them down when you wake up, or take a few waking moments to let your mind wander. Let this energy flow, and it will take you wonderful places.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
