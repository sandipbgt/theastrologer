    "horoscope": "You're generally an easygoing person, but today you're especially go-with-the-flow. You want to make life easier for others. You're humble enough not to care about personal gain or recognition. Nothing in those categories could be as satisfying now as a strong, sweet connection shared with a good friend. It's easy to make yourself vulnerable now, because you have a deep sense of faith.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
