That may include practical activities such as cooking or going to the office. But you could also work through a problem with a loved one. Whatever you do today, do it from the heart. Be authentic and express yourself truly. Let your love shine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
