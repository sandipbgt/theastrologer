You shine in situations that put your best qualities to work -- especially if you get positive feedback from others for your efforts. But your temper is also right at the surface now. Try to keep a rein on it if you start to feel irritated or overlooked. Otherwise, sensing that you aren't getting the props you deserve could really set you off!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
