    "horoscope": "Your inflexible side recedes today. In its place is a softhearted, compassionate energy that makes you sympathetic toward anyone and everyone. You're in such a sentimental mood, a sad story can pierce your heart. A gorgeous song might prompt memories that bring tears to your eyes. This is a perfect day to connect with someone you love, because your feelings are right there at the surface.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
