    "horoscope": "A lively energy is at work today. You may get involved in energetic debates over issues you find interesting. You might even find you're more passionate about a certain subject than you realized! If so, make sure you aren't just digging your heels in purely to make a point. This is a good day to practice your listening and cooperation skills, because the natural urge now is to assert your opinions rather aggressively.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
