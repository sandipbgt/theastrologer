But it's likely that you won't have to put out any fires at all, because the whole world seems easygoing now. It's a great day for spending time at home or with people you love and trust. It's also a great day for getting a lot accomplished, because your energy is strong and steady.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
