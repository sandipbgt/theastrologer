You have the energy it takes to see this project through to the end, and you know it's going to shine once it's completed. Of course, you have no problem bragging about your abilities -- that is, if someone asks. But until then, you'll just keep moving steadily forward toward the success that you know is yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
