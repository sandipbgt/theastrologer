    "horoscope": "You have a strong sense of what's practical, which makes your opinions equally strong. After all, you don't form them until you've thought through something pretty carefully. But today, you should be operating under a sense of discovery. A closed mind would just shut this down! Stay open to new ideas instead. Question everything, especially your own assumptions about what you 'know' to be true. You might shock yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
