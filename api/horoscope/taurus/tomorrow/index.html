If you have to go to the office, you'll show up on time or even early, and you'll be highly productive while you're there. If you're spending time with your family, you're able to make a genuine connection or provide levelheaded advice. Everyone appreciates your grounded energy and conscientious approach to taking care of business.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
