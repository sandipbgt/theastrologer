    "horoscope": "A promotion or a raise might be on its way, because you're suddenly so adept at all things detail-oriented and analytical. You know just how to seek and speak the truth gracefully, to attend to details while still treating friends and coworkers with sensitivity. Surely these skills deserve a bonus of some kind, even if it's the bonus of creating good karma. Treating everyone in your life well, focusing on your work -- this is what secures others' support and admiration.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
