    "horoscope": "Today could be an emotional day. You're extra sensitive right now to snubs and insults. And yet, if you take an honest look inside yourself, you may realize that your sensitive spots -- those buttons you don't want anyone to push -- come from anxieties you have about yourself. If you're willing to inspect your motivations, you can turn an upsetting event into a wonderfully effective personal transformation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
