    "horoscope": "Today's energy is strong and emotionally charged. This is the kind of day when your feelings might overtake your common sense. Jealousy and suspicion can bloom if you aren't careful to stay levelheaded. If these dark feelings do start to develop, go ahead and feel them -- but try not to take them too seriously. Giving them too much importance does you no good. They're just emotions, after all. They'll pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
