You can serve as an anchor for anyone in your life who isn't feeling so serenely on top of things. If nothing else, you can be an example for them. You're moving through your task list with such efficiency, you make even tedious tasks look easy!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
