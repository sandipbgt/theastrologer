Connecting with the deepest part of yourself is important now, whether you do that through artistic expression or through making an affectionate bond with someone else. If you have to spend the day working hard, you'll feel much less satisfied than if you can follow your muse and indulge in simple, heartfelt pursuits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
