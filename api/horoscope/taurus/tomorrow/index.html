Your mind is stimulated, so you don't mind doing your homework. If your project is in solid shape, good work! If it needs refinement, no problem. You've got plenty of time to make it right. You'd much rather do that than hurry through it. Pace yourself, and you'll go far.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
