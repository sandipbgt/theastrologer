Dream harder and reach higher. Attach yourself to the future today and let it pull you forward in the direction of your choice. The past will still be there when you're ready to look back. Actually, the past will always be there, and there's no way to alter it anyhow. Have the courage to confront what you can actually change. More applause just makes it easier.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
