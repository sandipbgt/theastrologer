This might mean looking into buying or selling a property, fixing something in your home that's broken, or researching career opportunities. It's also a great time for making sure your budget and savings strategy are practical. Solidify things for your future, and your family's future as well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
