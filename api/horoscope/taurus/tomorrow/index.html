    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic influence pushes you to work on your group skills. You're a mellow, easygoing person -- that is, until you feel like you're backed into a corner. Then, you can get pretty headstrong about your point of view! That's the kind of dynamic that could develop today, as the current energy highlights your stubborn streak. Consider this a good lesson in working with people whose ideas differ from your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
