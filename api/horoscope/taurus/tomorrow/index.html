    "horoscope": "Take it easy today. You're a diligent, hardworking type, but you also appreciate the value of rest and relaxation. And this is the perfect day for it. Put on a good movie or CD, or relax on the couch with a book. Indulge in a nap or a bath. And get to bed early tonight. Your energy may not be quite as strong as usual, so extra sleep helps you conserve your strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
