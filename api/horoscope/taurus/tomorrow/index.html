    "horoscope": "Someone's display of individuality may threaten you today, on an emotional level. Innovative ideas and unexpected acts make you nervous now. Maybe you're afraid your child's or friend's independence will pull them away from you. That's an understandable fear, but an unfounded one. Everyone is an individual, after all. And growth and positive change depend on testing new methods and ideas. Give people a chance to express their true uniqueness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
