    "horoscope": "Life becomes almost entirely subjective today. Your feelings take center stage. This includes the emotional connections you share with other people. You might feel extra tender toward a loved one, or especially nurturing. You want to share others' burdens and help heal their emotional wounds. Since you're such a strong, solid person, you stand a great chance of really making a difference in someone's life, or at least their day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
