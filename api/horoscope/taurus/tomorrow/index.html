    "horoscope": "Your devotion to your loved ones is strengthened under the current cosmic influence. The attachment you feel is deep and real, and it's wonderful to explore it. The only problem that may develop is if you sense your affection isn't being returned as strongly as you would prefer. That's when tricky feelings like jealousy and possessiveness can rear their ugly heads. Don't give in to them! No-strings-attached warmth and generosity are best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
