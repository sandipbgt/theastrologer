    "horoscope": "This should be a good day for you. You're productive and practical, and being grounded feels right. Your timing is excellent, and you're firm and steady. Others look up to you for advice, and it's no wonder -- not only do you give savvy pointers, you also encourage others and share your handy pool of resources. You'll take yourself far today.
