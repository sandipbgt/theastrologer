Plus, you have a nice grasp of your inner strength as well as your legendary physical endurance. Today you can make real, concrete efforts toward your favorite goals. This is a good time to take a firm moral stand, because you know exactly what your values are and you're very convincing in your grounded certainty. It's easier than ever to persuade others to stand beside you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
