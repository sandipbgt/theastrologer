It could be fun or miserable, but it'll be over in the blink of an eye. That's why you must be clear about your mission. Make reasonable decisions. Work with what you're given. Don't consume more than you have. And even if you doubt others, believe them when they say they're doing their best. It's going to take everyone's efforts to pull through this together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
