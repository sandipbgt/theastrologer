You know what's expected of you and how to attain your goals in any area of life. It's okay to purchase something now that will retain its value over time, as long as you can afford it. Of course, there's little worry that you'll overextend your budget. You're too sensible for that!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
