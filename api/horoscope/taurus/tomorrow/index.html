    "horoscope": "A rebellious urge wells up within you today. You're generally quite satisfied with the traditional route -- hey, it's been tested and approved, right? But now you want to do something a little bit wild and unexpected. Great -- go for it! Just make sure you aren't rebelling simply for the sake of rebellion itself. Crossing boundaries or breaking rules with a specific purpose in mind is much better than simply acting out like a teenager.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
