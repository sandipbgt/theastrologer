    "horoscope": "Certain desires flare up today. You've always been oriented toward things you can touch and feel with your own hands. Now, you want to possess those things. A shopping trip could be a dangerous prospect, if you can't afford to splurge! It would be a lot better to focus your tactile urges on another person. Give your sweetie a foot massage, or cook a gourmet dinner for your family.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
