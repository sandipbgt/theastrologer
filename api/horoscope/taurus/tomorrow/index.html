This isn't a good day for trying anything creative or risky, especially when it comes to handling your money or your career -- but you aren't in the mood for that kind of thing anyway. Traditional routes toward success hold a lot of comfort for you now. Draw on the advice of experts as you move forward with cautious confidence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
