    "horoscope": "Are you ready for some intensity? The answer should be yes, because this is going to feel good. The first thing to do is step out of your solitude. Leave the great outdoors behind and come into the waiting arms of your community. They care about you. Concentrate on feeling out this group and contributing to their shared efforts today. Being yourself will be easy when your heart is in it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
