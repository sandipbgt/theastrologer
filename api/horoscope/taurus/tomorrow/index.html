    "horoscope": "You feel robust -- a lucky break, since you could be in for a day of hard work. You have the focus and determination needed to tackle a project with real vigor. It's good you love putting effort into things that really mean a lot, because downtime might not be possible now. Choose a project that requires real discipline, and get ahead now. Later, when you're feeling less driven, you can relax, knowing you gave it your all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
