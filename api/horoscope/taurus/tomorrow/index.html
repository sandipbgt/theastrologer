    "horoscope": "Life gets a little intense today. Your feelings are stronger than usual. Things seem bigger than they really are. It's easy to make a big deal out of nothing.

But in the moment, there's no convincing you to back down and cool off! Try to keep a sense of perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
