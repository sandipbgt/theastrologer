    "horoscope": "You feel extra grounded and stable today. You're truly in your element. If the weather is nice, it's a great time to get outdoors and commune with the natural world. If you're stuck inside, there are still plenty of ways to honor this energy. Physical exercise feels great, especially slower-paced, endurance-based workouts. Treat yourself afterward with something nice -- a sweet treat, perhaps, or a bubble bath or massage.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
