    "horoscope": "You enjoy life. Hey, can you help it if you appreciate good foods and fine things? Today, your urge to indulge is even stronger than usual. Find your famous willpower, and use it to resist what you know you don't need. Instead, focus your sense of enjoyment on what can't be bought: a fine spring day, the affection of a close friend, and how good you feel at this time of year.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
