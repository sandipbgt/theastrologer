If you aren't the type to take risks, even mentally, this could be a stretch for you. But the current energy is all about moving outside your comfort zone. Get a little experimental. Be creative and inventive. If you try something that doesn't work, you can just scrap the idea and try something else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
