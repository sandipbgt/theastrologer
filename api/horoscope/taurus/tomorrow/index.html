    "horoscope": "Self-expression could be a tricky thing today. On the one hand, you're filled with a sense of your own power. A boost in self-confidence makes it fun to engage in conversations and lively debates. You relish the opportunity to demonstrate your creative ideas! On the other hand, that boldness and energy can translate into overbearing behavior. Try to be conscious of how you're coming across to others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
