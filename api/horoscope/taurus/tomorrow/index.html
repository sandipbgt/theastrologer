    "horoscope": "You might end up doing more talking today than work or other accomplishments. Though you're normally so focused, your thoughts are scattered now. You start one project, but then another beckons, or the phone rings, or a coworker or friend stops by -- and before you know it, it's evening and you've done very little. That's the way some days are. Just do your best, and enjoy the social contacts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
