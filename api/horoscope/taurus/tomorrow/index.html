    "horoscope": "Your mind, body and heart are working comfortably together today. Your emotions are stirred up, but in the sweetest way. You're quite sentimentally connected to your loved ones and the places where you feel most comfortable. Home -- whether that's your place of residence, a dear friend's house, or anyplace that holds great meaning for you -- is a safe haven. Spend as much delicious, relaxing time there as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
