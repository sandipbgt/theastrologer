    "horoscope": "Today, your family and dear friends are at the top of your list of priorities. You're devoted to your loved ones, more now than ever. If one of them needs you, you'll drop everything to be there for them. Something may come up today that requires you to give that kind of support. If so, it won't be difficult for you. It just reaffirms that close, loving bond.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
