    "horoscope": "Self-indulgence threatens to overtake you today.  This on its own isn't a new thing, not for you. You've always been one for enjoying your food, friends and relaxation time. But maybe you're indulging now in more than just simple pleasures. When it comes to making moves at work or in a relationship, a little forethought would be smart. So would some self-restraint, if you can manage it. Don't give in to every temptation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
