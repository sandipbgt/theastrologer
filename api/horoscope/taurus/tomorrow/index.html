    "horoscope": "Be industrious today. Relaxing is so much more satisfying when you know you've put in your time at work. And right now, kicking back may not even appeal as much as putting in focused, steady effort toward a meaningful goal. It's a great day to get ahead in your career the honest way -- through good, old-fashioned elbow grease. Your excellent work ethic appeals to anyone who sees you in action.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
