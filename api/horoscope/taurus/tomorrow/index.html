    "horoscope": "It's still okay to be proud. Pride can help define who you are. Don't become stuck up, though. Don't delude or spoil yourself. Maybe there's no one exactly like you, but that doesn't make you better than everyone else. Today could easily rob you of what you so vainly possess, if you go around challenging other people's pride. Watch out. Don't confuse the present with the past. Stop reacting to things that happened long ago. Keep your personal history in its box and keep your senses in the moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
