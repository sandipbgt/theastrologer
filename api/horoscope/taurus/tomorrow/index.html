    "horoscope": "Sometimes you amaze yourself. Sometimes one little thing makes a critical difference. One hand washes the other, poetic justice rhymes like a Shakespeare sonnet, Paul returns all those stolen goods to Peter, and pigs actually seem to fly. You don't have to make excuses or adjustments when an elegant solution is also a comfortable fit. How convenient is that? You're doing so well that it's almost too good to be true. But don't jinx yourself by pretending to be unworthy. You just lucked into the right time and place of a massively complex event.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
