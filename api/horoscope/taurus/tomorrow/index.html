In fact, you might not get much accomplished, because you're so happy to engage in interactions with other people! If you work in a position that depends on customer service or other communication, you'll do well today. You might learn something new, too. Your mind is more open and agile than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
