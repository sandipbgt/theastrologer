    "horoscope": "Somehow you feel stuck in an eat-or-be-eaten life cycle. But the world is more peaceful than you think. It's time to cool your jets and join in the harmony. If that doesn't seem possible right this minute, go for a walk or jog, or clean your house. Movement will help your good humor return, and imposing a bit of order on the things you can control will help you realize that things are actually just fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
