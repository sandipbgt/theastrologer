    "horoscope": "For now, set aside all things fanciful, even if you're in a playful, self-indulgent mood. Today, focus only on useful activities. You can make a lot of headway on existing projects. Don't begin anything new, though. If you start riffing on some grand new scheme, you'll just get carried away, and soon you'll realize your ideas were built on a foundation of sand. Stick to things you've already got in motion, and be happy with any minor benefits you encounter as you wrap things up. The big payoff will come later on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
