Snuggling up in your nice, warm bed sounds better than just about anything else you can think of! Get some extra sleep if possible, since your energy may not be as high as usual. Also, a nice nap or getting to bed early can make all the difference in keeping your emotions grounded.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
