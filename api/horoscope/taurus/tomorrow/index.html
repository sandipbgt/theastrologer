    "horoscope": "You feel passionately attached to your opinions today, even more so than usual. This can make it difficult to negotiate, especially if you're arguing with someone close to you, such as a family member or best friend. If someone disagrees with you, it can be deeply hurtful, almost like a personal rejection. And yet, logically, you know everyone is different. Remember that each person is entitled to their own point of view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
