There are other, less expensive ways to indulge yourself than grasping at things that aren't yours. Since you're feeling materialistic and a bit desperate, your first instinct is to get your hands on something -- anything -- that might soothe you. A longer-lasting approach is to review your boundaries and stay resolutely within them. That way, you won't have anything to regret.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
