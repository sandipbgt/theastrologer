    "horoscope": "You're in a cheerful mood, aren't you? That's why you keep reaching out to anyone who will listen. You're trying to recruit and motivate several different people.

Remember that the people around you already share your values. Maybe that will free you up to take care of more important business.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
