This won't be any trouble, because you're infused with plain, grounded honesty, and nothing fosters harmony better than a shared belief in the truth. You can have anyone eating out of your hand today, if that's what you want. This is the perfect time to push forward on a pet project, because you possess the energy and focus to accomplish something important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
