Anything that improves your balance, strength and reflexes is good, because you want to be ready when life gets exciting -- which could happen soon! For now, things are generally slow-paced and routine. Hit the gym or the trail, and bring a friend if you can. It's more fun to work out when you have good conversation to distract you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
