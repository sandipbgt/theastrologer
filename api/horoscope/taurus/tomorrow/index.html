    "horoscope": "If you try to pin someone down, they could become evasive. No one wants to rock the boat today -- not even you. Which means lots of folks won't give their true opinions. When you're in mixed company, it's best to avoid touchy subjects such as politics or spirituality. No one wants to sense tension in the group! Spend time with close friends now. It's a relief when you can be yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
