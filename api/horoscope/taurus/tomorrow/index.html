The world is full of duality and complications, and you're at the center of everything, trying to work it all out. Well, try not to let these things bother you today. You could choose to enjoy the minor chaos, you know. You're a natural at finding the rhythm and dancing right along with it, and this is the perfect time to draw on that talent. That way, you can face reality only when you're ready.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
