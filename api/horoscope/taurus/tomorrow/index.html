The impression you're making may not be as positive as you'd like. It's time to shape up, even if you'd rather act like a rebellious teenager. Apologize to anyone whose feelings you've hurt recently, and focus on creating a warm, comfortable atmosphere around you. This will help you feel more like your regular, stable self in no time,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
