    "horoscope": "Things feel a little weird at the moment, don't they? Your mood is off and you're uncomfortably aware of your habits and behavior, not to mention their effects on other people. Don't worry, though; your habits don't define you. You'll feel a lot better today if you seek solid footing on actual ground. Planting your feet connects you with your own earthy nature, and it's so much easier to stand for something when you're standing on solid ground. Most of all, don't neglect your health. Keeping your body centered helps your emotions follow suit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
