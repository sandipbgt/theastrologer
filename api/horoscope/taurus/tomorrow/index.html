    "horoscope": "Of course it's good to be ambitious and to stick to your plan. But going head-to-head with someone now could easily lead to trouble.

Cooperation counts for a lot now. You should be working to preserve your partnerships, not test them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
