And team efforts actually work out better than solo ones now. Why not get involved with whatever your friends are working on? With your strong back and excellent work ethic, you can certainly be of help. And working side by side makes you feel closer with them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
