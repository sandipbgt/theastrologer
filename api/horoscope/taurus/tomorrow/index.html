    "horoscope": "Today you're attuned to the needs and feelings of the people around you. You feel as if you'd do anything to help them, and being selflessly devoted to someone else has the side benefit of making you feel good about yourself. You've always been strong and capable, and today you're even gentler, kinder and more caring than usual. This is an unbeatable combination, Taurus. Use it for the good of everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
