    "horoscope": "What's wrong with showing respect, anyway? Who says that good manners only conceal the wolves among the sheep? If chivalry is just a nervous habit, you could do much worse. And you're so over that whole school-yard bully dynamic, anyway. Get beyond appearances today and show them that real wolves and real sheep have transcended their storybook roles. People have good and bad sides, and right now being decisive, loyal and, yes, polite will resolve a lot more problems than those behaviors create. In the end, that resolution is what brings real security.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
