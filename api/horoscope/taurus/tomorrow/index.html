    "horoscope": "Typically, you know your own mind -- too well, in fact. You're stubborn in your opinions, and once you develop one, it's hard to sway you from it. But today, you can more than one side of an issue. Your perspective is at once broad and detail-oriented. This may feel uncomfortable -- you're used to being opinionated! -- but just go with it. Gather as much information as you can, and decide later what to do with it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
