But don't allow yourself to get sloppy with this. Instead of getting all worked up over nothing, channel your energies toward a relationship or a project you really believe in. At least then you'll know it's worth it, even if things get a little messy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
