Maybe you've noticed how certain things are in short supply. Even if you're good on the material stuff, everyone could always use more patience and better manners. Be less demanding today. Speak without accusing, and if you can't do that, don't speak at all. These are useful exercises in self-control. You'll also learn how others feel when you focus less on yourself and pay more attention to them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
