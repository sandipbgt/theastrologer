    "horoscope": "Today, you might not feel as close with other people as you might prefer. That certain warmth you thrive on is missing. In its place is a highly intellectual energy, which is important in its own way. Many people are in this thinking space. Perhaps you should take advantage of this influence, too. Get absorbed in an unusual subject. Push yourself outside your comfort zone. This is how you grow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
