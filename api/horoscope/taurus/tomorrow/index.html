People are picking up speed as they go, so expect to accelerate your own feverish pace over the course of the day. At least you've got the endurance to keep it up. Win or lose, this competition will be worth it. You'll see wonderful things before the day is over.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
