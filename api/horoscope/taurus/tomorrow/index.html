    "horoscope": "Deep conversations have a way of developing spontaneously today. It's as if you need to go to 'the dark side' -- those dim corners of your own soul that you rarely visit. What will you find once you're there? Feelings of fear, perhaps, or anxiety, desire or envy. These are all very human emotions. And talking about them with trusted friends can help lessen their intensity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
