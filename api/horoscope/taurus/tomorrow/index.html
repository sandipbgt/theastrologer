In fact, maybe it's you that's being a stick in the mud. Why else would you need such frequent stimulation? It's time for a little focus, which shouldn't be too hard. You'll be glad you did -- you can make something dull and routine shine once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
