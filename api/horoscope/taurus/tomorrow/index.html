    "horoscope": "Today you feel emotionally grounded and spiritually attuned. It's as if you're connected with the whole world -- other people, nature, animals, and the cosmic energy that's affecting you at a very subtle level. It's a great day to explore your spirituality in any way that is meaningful to you. This might mean visiting a place of worship, or simply feeling reverent when you hug someone you love or absorb the beauty of nature.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
