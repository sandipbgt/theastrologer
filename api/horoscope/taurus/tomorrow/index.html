    "horoscope": "Communication is your forte at the moment, and you're the mediator of any disputes that come up. This has become routine by now -- are you bored yet? Try to have a good attitude about it,. Snags in a project at work or home need to be worked out before you can move forward. Sometimes you have to put a little effort into maintenance. Life can't always be about taking great strides toward a big, bright future. Things will get interesting again, I promise. For now, sit tight, and do what needs doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
