    "horoscope": "An anxious feeling in the pit of your stomach has you on edge and feeling slightly self-conscious. Some exercise would help alleviate that nervous tension. And making an effort to be generous with others today will take your mind off your problems. Best of all, other people will appreciate you, which will help your self-confidence return. Sometimes, contentment is really about getting out of your own head and back into the big, sweet world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
