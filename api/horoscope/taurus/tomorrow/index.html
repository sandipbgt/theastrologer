    "horoscope": "Unexpected emotions may bubble to the surface today. Perhaps you're brooding over something that happened in the past. Or maybe someone hurts your feelings anew. Either way, processing your emotions is important. But find a private, safe way to do so. Try writing about them in your journal or talking them out with a trusted -- and neutral -- friend or counselor. That will help you get a better handle on them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
