    "horoscope": "Don't get caught up in a narrow, rigid way of thinking today. If you're getting frustrated while working on a project or trying to solve a problem, that means you aren't thinking broadly enough. The key now is thinking well outside the box. The problem for you, Taurus, is you're comfortable thinking inside that box, as long as it's a box that makes good, practical sense. Still, challenge yourself to learn something new.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
