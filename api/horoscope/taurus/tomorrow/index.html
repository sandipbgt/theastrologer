    "horoscope": "A confrontation is possible today, if you aren't careful in how you speak to others. Your strategies are shrewd and your arguments persistent. But those aren't always the most important things. Find balance and seek common ground instead of insisting on your own needs, feelings and expectations so stubbornly. Whether you're up against someone you love or a genuine opponent, hear them out. At the very least, this will help you formulate better rebuttals.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
