    "horoscope": "Don't worry if you get caught up in a scene of some sort. You're feeling centered and good-humored enough to handle it. You're in touch with the universe now, enough to know that drama has its place -- but so does being evenhanded, which comes easily to you. Everyone will get their turn very soon, so you aren't worried about missing out on anything. What a relaxed and relaxing place to be. See if you can spread this attitude.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
