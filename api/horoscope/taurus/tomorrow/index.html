You're more attuned to your health than usual, so eating a more balanced diet is an easier undertaking now. It's mostly a matter of recognizing the consequences of unhealthy eating. The same goes for work, exercise, and any other way in which you need to get back on track.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
