But being possessive isn't always a bad thing. It's not like you're obsessing. You're simply appreciating how much this person, place or thing means to you. Sometimes you show your love and commitment: by holding on tightly. This is one of those times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
