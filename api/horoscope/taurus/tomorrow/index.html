    "horoscope": "Hard work is your middle name. Getting your life on track and moving forward is an actual pleasure. You're full of energy, which certainly helps. So does that sense of inner focus that always points you in the right direction. You feel a surge of inner power to organize your life. Start with something manageable, and then move on from there. Above all, enjoy this chance to mobilize yourself into positive action.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
