    "horoscope": "If a gloomy feeling assails you today, don't obsess over it. Of course, it's hard not to be preoccupied when you're sad or worried. But that's when activities like work and exercise come in handy. Lose yourself in a project or a vigorous workout. Forget about your troubles for a few hours. This could bring you some perspective when you focus on your feelings once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
