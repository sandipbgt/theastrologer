    "horoscope": "A warmly romantic mood puts you in mind to spend time with someone special today, or to get out on the town with friends. Hanging out at home by yourself just won't cut it -- unless, of course, you're absorbed in watching an exciting movie or reading a good book. Under the current cosmic energy, romantic comedies and action-adventure flicks are best! You need that thrill of excitement to stimulate your senses.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
