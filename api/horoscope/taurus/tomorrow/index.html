But now the universe is daring you to look at all sides of an issue, and to suspend judgment until you learn as much about it as you can. This applies to people, too. Snap judgments won't serve you nearly as well now as a charitable attitude.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
