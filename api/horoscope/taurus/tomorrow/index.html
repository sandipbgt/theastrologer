    "horoscope": "You're a commanding presence today in the office or at home. You feel a strong sense of self-confidence that allows you to draw others' attention and support, if you need it. But you may be just fine with getting things done on your own. You're more than capable of focus and hard work now, and you know it. Your commonsense view of things helps you figure out what to do first, and tackle it with ease.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
