You'd actually be better off brainstorming new approaches to an old problem, tying up loose ends somewhere, or simply enjoying yourself with good friends. That way, you'll preserve this positive feeling instead of wasting your energy on fruitless pursuits. It'll be especially easy if you ignore the possibility of change. That comes later. For now, focus on enjoying how far you've come.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
