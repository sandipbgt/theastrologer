If you have work to do, you may procrastinate till the last minute before finally getting down to business, unless your task is creative in nature. You're much more in the mood to get together with friends to share laughter and conversation. Ask someone to join you as you run errands or do work around the house. It'll be more fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
