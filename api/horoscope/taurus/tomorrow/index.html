    "horoscope": "Uh-oh. Suddenly they're paying attention. Does that make you self-conscious? If so, you'd better get over it, because your 15 minutes of fame could be starting right about now. It would be natural to back away if you're not ready. Just don't tone it down too far, or you'll reduce the song of yourself to a mere whisper. Do try being more grounded, though. That can be healing, plus it might also clear a lot of the static out of your signal. And even if this isn't your big moment after all, it could still be a turning point.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
