    "horoscope": "You tend to be a rather methodical thinker, but today it's easier than usual to make quick mental connections. Thoughts and ideas spark off one another, creating kinetic energy as they spontaneously create and combust. Use this keen mental energy to solve a puzzle or brainstorm a project. Or, simply have fun talking and debating with friends. Sometimes it's nice just to get in a mental workout, even if it's ultimately aimless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
