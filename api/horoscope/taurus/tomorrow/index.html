    "horoscope": "A sudden burst of greed has you shoveling in everything you possibly can today. Whether you're consuming food, material items or ten more minutes on the snooze button, you're headed for major indigestion if you don't slow down. Take what you need, and no more. That's probably a lot less than you think. One way to judge is by looking to see how much the people around you are using. They may have a more moderate and realistic attitude about their desires.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
