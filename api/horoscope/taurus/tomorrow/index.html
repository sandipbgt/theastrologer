    "horoscope": "A sweet, sentimental mood sets in today, warming your heart. Your sense of compassion for other people deepens. You understand their feelings and their problems even better than usual, which makes it easy to reach out to them in a warm, natural way. Lend your support to someone who needs it, or let a friend know how much you care for them. Even the smallest acts of generosity can make a big difference.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
