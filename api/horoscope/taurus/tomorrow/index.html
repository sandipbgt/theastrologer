The truth is, they'll seem a lot more manageable soon -- but right now, it's probably hard to take comfort in that fact. Still, you can easily pull yourself out of this mood today. Just focus on the love you share with a friend, pet or your sweetheart. Look for love, and your spirits will lift.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
