    "horoscope": "Your physical passion is on high today, which could make for a fun, intense encounter with someone special. But remember that the good kind of passion can turn quickly to that other type of passion -- anger -- if you aren't careful about your behavior. If you sensefrom someone, you might turn stubborn fast. Avoid conflict by reminding yourself to listen and be compassionate. Be your gentle self,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
