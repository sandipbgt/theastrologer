    "horoscope": "A deeply compassionate mood sets in today. You can easily sense others' feelings, especially the people with whom you're closest. You can tell if they're worried or upset about something. You're probably their rock, anyway -- the person they rely on for solid support and good advice when the going gets rough. Give them that same support now. Paired with your deep and abiding affection for them, that's a cure for any ill.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
