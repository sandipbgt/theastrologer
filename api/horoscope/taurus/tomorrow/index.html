    "horoscope": "You have a great opportunity to explore your deepest feelings today, or to connect at an intimate level with someone else. But this process works best when it's undertaken mindfully. If you don't make a conscious effort to delve into your own emotions, something will bring them to the surface in a more forceful way. This is the sort of experience you can either guide or submit to. It's your choice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
