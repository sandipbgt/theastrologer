    "horoscope": "Believe it or not, you're influential, even if it doesn't feel that way at the moment. Whether it's due to your deep passion or your genuine interest, you really are having an effect. Your dreams and destinies might even come true today. But don't hold your breath, and don't get smug about it. Counting your chicks before they're hatched is never a good idea. Just keep doing what you're doing. Apply your energy to an important project or relationship, and stay positive. (c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
