    "horoscope": "Your partnerships take center stage today. It's a good time to negotiate a truce with someone, because you're both interested in staying harmoniously connected. You're more willing than usual to do what it takes to get along, even if that means bending over backward for the other person. Just don't bend unreasonably far. If you give up too much for too little, it could leave you feeling resentful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
