    "horoscope": "You look down on those who are too well put together. It's like they're trying to imitate catalog models. And when they actually succeed, that's when you really let them have it. So what's your issue with accepting the standards of fashion? Maybe the problem is that your own appearance is getting a little slovenly. Maybe you don't care at all, but on the other hand, maybe you care a lot. Don't deny what bothers you if you can fix it. Spend the day sprucing up. But make a point of looking like yourself, not someone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
