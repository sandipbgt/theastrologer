    "horoscope": "You're in a gentle, sentimental mood -- perfect for enjoying the company of your loved ones. You're in a nurturing frame of mind today, so cook comfort foods at home or find other ways of making yourself and your friends and family feel loved. Soon, you'll have to get back to the business of your daily life, but today it's okay to steep yourself in sweet, deep emotion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
