    "horoscope": "Battles of wills are possible today, because you're feeling a strange cocktail of intense emotions, including jealousy, stubbornness and possessiveness -- a potent combination. You may not realize it, but you're behaving in a controlling way, and that's setting off the people around you. Make an effort to cooperate instead of bossing other people around,. It's time to focus on the good things in life, which normally comes naturally to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
