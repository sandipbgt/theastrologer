You're unflappable, and there's no reason to worry about anyone's performance or behavior but your own. You have a unique chance to improve something in your life, so take it. You can get ahead at work or on a creative project, or a relationship. You'll also enjoy this period's deep sleep and clear, strong energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
