Start brainstorming new ideas and get excited about your plans, and spend some time clearing the decks. Focus on staying healthy and happy while various elements in your life finish sorting themselves out. Don't worry -- it'll happen, and soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
