    "horoscope": "Your will is strong and your perceptive powers are sharp today. You feel in top form, ready for anything -- but no one seems to need your skills at the moment. Don't be too disappointed. Your talents will be needed soon, and besides, you work hard enough. Take this short breather as the blessing that it is. If you can knock off work early, even better. Whatever you do, be sure to schedule in some fun and relaxation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
