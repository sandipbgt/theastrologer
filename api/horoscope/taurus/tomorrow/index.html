    "horoscope": "You're infused with emotion today. Suddenly, life is a purely subjective experience, and a sweet one. You feel blessed with kindness and rich in love. This is a good day to reach out to anyone who is ailing in any way, whether physical, spiritual, financial or otherwise. You're overflowing with compassion, and just a simple smile or hug from you can make someone else's day brighter. So pass it on, Taurus!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
