If you work in a visual field like photography or Web design, this can lend a certain flair to your work -- even if flair isn't what's needed! Add your personal touch to whatever you do, but be practical about it: Don't spend too much time or money doing so.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
