    "horoscope": "You're putting your foot down today over an issue you find important. And you might think you're exhibiting strength, but really, you're just being obstinate. A lenient attitude would go a lot further now than stubbornness. Try owning up to your weaknesses instead of denying them so vehemently. Your friends and coworkers will understand; they've been there, too.  Just a quick, minor attitude adjustment, and you'll get things wrapped up in no time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
