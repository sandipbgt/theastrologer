    "horoscope": "Repressed energy  brings an irritable day. It's time to find an appropriate outlet for venting, ASAP. And no, that doesn't mean exchanging jabs with your sweetie or arguing with your boss. That means hitting the gym or the trail for a sweaty workout, or having a sweaty physical session of a different kind. Find a way to work off some of your aggression, so you can enjoy life a little more. There, now -- wasn't that easy?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
