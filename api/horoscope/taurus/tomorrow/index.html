When you see something you want -- a rich dessert, an expensive outfit or piece of artwork -- you want it, now! Do your best to be realistic about what you can and can't afford. Before you indulge, consider what it may cost in the long run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
