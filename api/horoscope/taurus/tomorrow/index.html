    "horoscope": "You blew past laziness a day or two ago and right into full-on self-indulgence. You're not in the mood to do anything that's difficult or challenging in any way. Instead, you want to experience nothing but the pleasurable side of life. It might be nice to take a day or two to get out of town with someone special, or even by yourself. You can be your own best company! Don't be surprised, though, when putting everything on hold causes teetering pileups that demand your attention upon your return to regular life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
