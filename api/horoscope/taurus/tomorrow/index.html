    "horoscope": "All momentous events are on hold today. You have an important decision to make that will affect your future, so naturally, you don't want to act alone. Encourage everyone to speak freely; you need to hear from them before you can make an informed decision. And don't hurry over this. Take your time, even if you feel impatient. Let everyone catch up before anyone moves ahead. This will help you make the right choice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
