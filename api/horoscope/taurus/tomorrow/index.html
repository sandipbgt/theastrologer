    "horoscope": "Be honest today as you express your thoughts. Even if you're worried that you'll upset someone, it's important to speak your own truth. You can do this in a kind, gentle way. Social grace is one of your natural strengths, after all. Furthermore, being honest with yourself and others will lead you toward important discoveries about yourself, or your role in the world. And that's always good to know!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
