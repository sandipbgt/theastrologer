    "horoscope": "If your friends or coworkers seem a bit aloof today, take it as a sign that it's time for you to disconnect as well, so you can get some work done. This may not be your favorite energy; you prefer a warmer, more relaxed atmosphere, even in professional situations. But sometimes it's helpful to retreat from your usual environment in order to focus all your attention on important ideas or plans.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
