    "horoscope": "You're rather stirred up today, and you may be dealing with some tricky emotions such as jealousy or suspicion. These are natural feelings, of course, if uncomfortable ones. Everyone has them. But instead of simply talking it out with the person concerned, you turn stubborn and secretive. It's much better to take a forgiving attitude. Remember, you could easily be reading the situation wrong. Don't be hard on yourself or others, either.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
