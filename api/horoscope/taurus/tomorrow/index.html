    "horoscope": "You've stated your case. You've had your brief, earnest and well-earned moment in the. Now, settle in for a long, low-keyed wait. Take it easy despite bursts of energy. This is no time for tiring yourself out on premature efforts; it's a time for rest and rejuvenation. And come on: It's only for today. You can use this downtime to gather your strength, and come back full-throttle when the time is right. Then you'll wow everyone with your nonchalant genius and your can-do attitude.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
