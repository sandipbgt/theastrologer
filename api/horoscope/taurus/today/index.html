More than that, it's deeply satisfying. Even if you usually don't bother, setting reasonable limits for yourself actually feels good now. This is especially true if you're working toward a concrete goal for the future, one that's personally meaningful to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
