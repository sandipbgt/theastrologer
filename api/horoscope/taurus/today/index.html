    "horoscope": "It's a great time for you to take command. You're feeling strong and creative, and you know you can get the job done. Do so gently. Energies are running high all around today, and tempers could flare at a moment's notice. You have to be in charge of this ship today, and you want nothing but smooth sailing on your watch.
