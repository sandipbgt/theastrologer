Everyone has them. But instead of simply talking it out with the person concerned, you turn stubborn and secretive. It's much better to take a forgiving attitude. Remember, you could easily be reading the situation wrong. Don't be hard on yourself or others, either.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
