Don't push forward too hard on any project or scheme. Instead, relax or do behind-the-scenes work, such as getting your finances in order. Plan your next round of events so that you can redouble your effort soon and really make it a success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
