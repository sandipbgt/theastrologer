    "horoscope": "Get organized today. Put some effort into cleaning your home or workspace. The final result will make you feel wonderfully calm, from the inside out! Getting on track in terms of health and fitness brings you the same sense of self-possessed tranquility. You're taking your life into your own, quite capable hands. You can handle any obstacles that come your way. That's a good feeling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
