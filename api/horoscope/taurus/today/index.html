Stay that way today and you'll be able to get away with pretty much anything. You seem humble, too, so people will be only too happy to do your bidding or throw their support behind you. Of course, on the inside, you might be thinking something very naughty indeed -- or you might just feel lazy. Good thing you're faking diligence so well!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
