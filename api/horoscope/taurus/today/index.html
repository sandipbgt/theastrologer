    "sunsign": "Taurus",
    "horoscope": "Your stubborn streak swells today. Make a conscious effort to stay calm and open-minded, because the tendency is strong now to project all kinds of feelings and intentions onto other people -- and many times, these projections will be negative in tone. Guard against this, Taurus. Don't assume anything at work or at home. If a suspicious feeling sneaks into your consciousness, don't act on it! Ask the other person for clarification."
