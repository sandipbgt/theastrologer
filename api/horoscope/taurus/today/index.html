    "horoscope": "A deep sense of comfort pervades your soul today. You're incredibly generous toward other people, because your own desires and needs seem much less important than usual. Or maybe it's that you're so much more aware of other people and their emotional lives than usual. Your heart goes out to people who seem vulnerable. If a friend needs your strength, you'll provide it without having to be asked.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
