    "horoscope": "Spend time with loved ones today, especially children. They brighten your mood and your whole day. And being playful and affectionate with people you adore is one of the best ways to direct today's lunar energy. Stay mellow, especially if you're with family. Don't let them push your buttons! And avoid stubborn behavior, which only causes unnecessary tension. Keep things sunny and enjoyable. It's more fun for everyone that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
