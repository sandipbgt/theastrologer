    "horoscope": "Work at a steady pace today, or get some endurance-based exercise, like walking or jogging. Anything you do today that relies on a regular, continuous output of energy makes you feel beautifully centered. Hard effort actually puts you in a tranquil state of mind. You know you put in the time and did your job well. This frees you up to enjoy a break or the company of people you love.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
