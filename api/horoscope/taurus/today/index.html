If this is uncomfortable for you, that's probably a positive thing. You tend to be set in your opinions, so it's good to have those firm beliefs challenged once in a while! An experience or conversation may confirm what you've thought all along, but it may prompt a more open world view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
