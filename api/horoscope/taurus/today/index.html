    "horoscope": "Instead of acting like a grouch, take a deep breath and treat everyone with the respect they deserve. If you feel angry, you're practical enough to recognize that holding back your temper is a smart move. If you get overly worked up, you might be out of a support network, and you don't want that. So keep your relationships happily intact by finding a more constructive way to ease your temper.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
