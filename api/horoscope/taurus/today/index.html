But hold back and do the prudent, neighborly thing today instead. You'll actually enjoy the downtime if you just give it a chance. By purposely slowing down and getting along with people, you'll score big points for later. Open your ears, while you're at it. Someone's great idea could give you a whole new approach, which you can put to use soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
