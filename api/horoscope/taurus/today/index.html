You're famous for holding grudges, but now it's much easier than usual to forgive and forget. Thus, it's a wonderful day for bridging gaps in your relationships. You can make a heartfelt connection with someone from who you previously felt estranged.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
