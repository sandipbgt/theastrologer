    "horoscope": "You just don't have it in you to be aggressive today. A passive mood has crept in and replaced your usual, opinionated self. You want to get along with others in gentle harmony, so you'll defer to your coworker's approach to a project or your spouse's choice of movie or restaurant. The truth is, you don't mind what you do now, as long as you can enjoy being together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
