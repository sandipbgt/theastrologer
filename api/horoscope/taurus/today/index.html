For instance, this is a relatively painless way to open the door for wisdom. Well, it sure beats learning these things from the school of hard knocks, wouldn't you say? Plus, knowing when to put on the company manners will give you a good basis for future contact, whether you're looking at romance, business or social networking. You never know who's going to return a favor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
