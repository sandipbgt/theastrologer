    "horoscope": "You're filled with a sense of satisfaction today that's almost elemental. You're in touch with all the things in life that mean the most to you. You're warmhearted and affectionate. Your body is strong, and so is your mind. Your connections with loved ones are stable. If any of these elements is lacking in some way, get things back on track now. A simple, heartfelt approach will take you far.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
