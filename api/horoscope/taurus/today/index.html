Someone is pressuring you for an answer or action you're not ready for. If you're forced to give a prompt response, it may not be effective or satisfying for anyone. You need more time to investigate and consider. Hold off if you can, so you can get clear on your next move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
