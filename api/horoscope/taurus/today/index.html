    "horoscope": "You have extra energy today, which is good for any quick jobs you need to tackle. You're in the mood for a party, too, and might spend time in the kitchen, baking yummy treats. But don't sample too much of the batter! Sometimes you use food to soothe your jangled nerves,. Avoid falling into that trap today. On the other hand, enjoy yourself. You can use this energy burst to work off any extra calories.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
