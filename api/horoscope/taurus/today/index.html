If you have responsibilities at home or the office, you'll perform them with ease. Your employer or loved ones are sure to be impressed at how stoic you are! And the sooner you wrap up your to-do list, the sooner you can relax -- always a good thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
