    "horoscope": "Today, your strongest emotions and desires are right at the surface of your consciousness. You crave closeness. This could lead to an enjoyably intense encounter with someone, but it could also lead to a difficult one, if you aren't careful to temper your feelings and reactions. Raw emotion can be enlightening -- transformative, even -- but it can also be difficult and hurtful. At least you're strong enough to ride that wave.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
