    "horoscope": "There's no need for theatrics today, or for throwing your energy into projects that aren't going anywhere. Instead, let yourself off the hook and just be honest and dutiful. Maybe that's a little dull, but on the other hand, maybe you've had enough excitement for the moment. And admitting that just makes you human. Isn't it nice to get a breather every now and then? Enjoy this downtime, because life is sure to pick up the pace again soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
