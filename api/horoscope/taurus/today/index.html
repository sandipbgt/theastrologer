Plus, you're steadily working toward a goal that means a lot. Keep that in mind if things get a little challenging. Also, remember that you don't have to tackle everything alone. Delegating tasks or asking someone to help you brainstorm could make all the difference between a frustrating day and a rewarding one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
