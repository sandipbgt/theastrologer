Once you've completed your tasks, you can kick back and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Sharing a meal with friends or family feels especially good now. Let yourself indulge in your favorite flavors and engaging conversations with people you adore.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
