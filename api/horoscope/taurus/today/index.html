    "horoscope": "Creativity and culture are pulling at you. Let them. Surrender to the lure of the arts today, and don't be shy about opening up your treasure chest. Start a far-reaching project. Maybe you'll commit a month to this, or maybe you could set aside an even bigger block of time. But even if you're just dabbling or doodling, you're good on inspiration. Ask around for the materials if you don't see what you want. You might end up with people as well as supplies, and imagine what you could do if you all joined forces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
