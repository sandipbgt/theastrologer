You just want things to be nice and easy -- which is great, as long as life cooperates with your wishes! But if a tense situation develops, avoid stubbornness. If your temper rises, set it to simmer. It's really important to find common ground with others now, instead of emphasizing your differences.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
