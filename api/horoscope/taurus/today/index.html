    "horoscope": "Your energy is flowing along with your thoughts and emotions. Your own grounded nature blends well with today's heightened emotional sensitivity. It helps you understand life on several levels at once. You can sense others' feelings and needs, and then respond to them in a practical way. If you work in a service industry, you're sure to do your job very well today. If you have children, you'll hug them with extra warmth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
