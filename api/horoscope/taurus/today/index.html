    "horoscope": "This may be a quiet, passive day. If your energy is a bit low now, take it easy. There's no need to push yourself. Instead, nurture yourself. Get some extra sleep. Leave physically vigorous tasks for another day. You may have trouble concentrating now, too, so hard work at the office may go out the window as well. The key now is to be gentle with yourself and others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
