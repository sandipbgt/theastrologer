On days like today, when you're feeling less than content, you're even more likely to indulge in your favorite treats, whether they're rich foods, new clothes, CDs, or DVDs. But maybe it's time to deal with an insecure mood in a new, more effective way. Instead of whining over what you don't have, try appreciating what you do.
