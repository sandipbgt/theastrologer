    "horoscope": "Financial and material security are important to you, today even more so than usual. Spend some time strengthening your home, career or money situation. This might mean looking into buying or selling a property, fixing something in your home that's broken, or researching career opportunities. It's also a great time for making sure your budget and savings strategy are practical. Solidify things for your future, and your family's future as well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
