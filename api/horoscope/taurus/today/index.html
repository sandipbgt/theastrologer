    "horoscope": "Agreement between partners is especially important today, whether the relationship is personal or professional. That means it's especially important for you to keep a close rein on your stubborn streak. Make a conscious effort to listen well. Consider the other person's perspective. In case of a disagreement, find a compromise that works for both of you. Emphasize what makes you compatible rather than what makes you different or unique.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
