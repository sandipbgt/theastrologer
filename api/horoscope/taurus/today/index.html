    "horoscope": "High energy has you moving ahead today at double your usual pace. In certain contexts, this is a very good thing. Instead of plodding along in an unhurried manner, you can speed ahead and get a lot accomplished! Just make sure you aren't cutting corners that shouldn't be cut. Rely on your practical wisdom to let you know when you should slow down and pay more careful attention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
