    "horoscope": "Watch out for stubbornness today. You're particularly sensitive to blatant power plays and ego battles, and that's just the type of dynamic that arises under the current influence. When someone pushes you, you tend to push back! It's that strong-as-a-bull iron will of yours. But it's possible that you're misreading the situation, or overreacting. After all, many people are more sensitive now than usual. Try to stay flexible and forgiving.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
