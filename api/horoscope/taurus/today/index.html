    "horoscope": "You're feeling pretty fond of yourself at the moment, aren't you? You like your looks, and you're maintaining them by staying healthy and relaxed -- two of your fortes. Okay, so you'd rather not ripple your reflective pool today -- that's understandable. But life isn't always about self-indulgence, much as you might beg to differ. If you don't rouse yourself to action when necessary, you could end up feeling very uneasy -- the exact opposite of healthy and relaxed. So get ready to get moving.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
