    "horoscope": "Familiar things seem especially dear to you now. You want to hold on tight and never let go. Maybe that's not exactly practical, or even possible beyond this moment. But being possessive isn't always a bad thing. It's not like you're obsessing. You're simply appreciating how much this person, place or thing means to you. Sometimes you show your love and commitment: by holding on tightly. This is one of those times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
