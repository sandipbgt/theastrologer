Deepen and strengthen this positive situation by carefully considering the options that present themselves. Make a plan you can stick to. If you jump into something new without forethought, you could easily end up running yourself ragged. Preserve your health by taking things forward slowly but surely.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
