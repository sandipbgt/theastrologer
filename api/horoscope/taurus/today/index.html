    "horoscope": "A sentimental mood fills your heart today. A phone call from a friend is like balm for your soul. Looking at old photographs makes you smile, and maybe shed a tear as well. Sometimes it's nice to steep yourself in nostalgia, isn't it? Even bittersweet memories hold their appeal. Reminding yourself of the continuity of your own life -- past, present and future -- makes you feel stable and serene.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
