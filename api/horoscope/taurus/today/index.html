    "horoscope": "You know you need to work with other people, but really -- why compromise now? You're focused on what you want, and others are attracted to your magnetic energy. That gives you some leeway to conserve your resources for something else. In fact, today can be as fulfilling as you want it to be, because your own energy is strong and centered, and you're surrounded by plenty of people who admire you. This is a great time to start a new project or relationship. Go ahead and push yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
