    "horoscope": "It's easy for your individuality to be submerged in a bid for closeness today. You want harmony and affection now, and if that means being less hardheaded, then so be it. Of course, making that sort of tradeoff rarely feels worth it for long. Your opinions and point of view are what make you who you are. Soon, your true personality will reemerge -- including the quirks that define you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
