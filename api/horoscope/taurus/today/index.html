Pay attention when you do something right, because those karma points are building up fast. You'll just have to start using this personal energy while it's still so exciting. Nothing can stop your beautiful actions and tasteful choices this month. Well, money and time could probably get in the way, but if you win the right hearts early in the game, those little glitches will be easy enough to fix.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
