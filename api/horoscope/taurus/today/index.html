    "horoscope": "You're feeling a little off, and your first instinct when that happens is to pamper yourself. The only problem is, indulging yourself today could make things worse. Other people might think you're vulgar if you're too focused on your own pleasures. Don't even try to convince yourself that their judgments don't matter -- they do, more than you may realize. A better way to handle this mood is to eat right, get plenty of sleep, and exercise. Maintaining your health is a form of self-indulgence, after all, but one no one could argue with.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
