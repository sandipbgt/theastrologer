    "horoscope": "Throwing money around like it's confetti won't win you friends today. In fact, it could end up alienating people. You could come across as a little bit desperate, and you wouldn't want that. Besides, you can find other ways to show them your passion. Try methods that cost nothing, such as conversation. Talk about your feelings and your interests, and ask other people about theirs. Get a dialogue going.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
