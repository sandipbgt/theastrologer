    "horoscope": "Your usual mellowness is enlivened by a playful mood today, making you a natural at parties and meetings. You're inviting and gregarious, charming people who know you and those who don't. If someone doesn't trust you because you're 'too nice,' remember, it's their loss and your gain. You just want to be around people who appreciate your strength and kindness. Be your best self in every crowd. You never know who you'll meet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
