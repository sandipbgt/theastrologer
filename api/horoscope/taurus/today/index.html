    "horoscope": "Strange passions fill you today. You might have intense responses to mundane issues that bubble up out of nowhere. Whatever you're reacting to, you're probably right. Still, a subtle approach might be best. Judge by the reaction of your audience -- they might be able to understand your impassioned behavior. It might even get them on your side. But if you're at work, appealing to higher-ups or colleagues, stay calm and focused as you state your case.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
