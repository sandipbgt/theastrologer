    "horoscope": "Instead of sticking to your usual routine today, break out of the box a little. What's wrong with being spontaneous? Nothing -- it just makes you nervous, that's all. But right now, feeling out of your element is a good sign. It means you're adopting an adventurous attitude, which is definitely favored. Anything you can do now to create a sense of freshness in your life is a good thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
