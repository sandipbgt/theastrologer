    "horoscope": "Change makes you uncomfortable. There's always a transition period during which you have to adjust to the new way of doing and being. Now is no different, but you can change your attitude, with just a little effort. Face the positive opportunities that arise with good humor, and remember that nothing is decided yet. You're a pro at working hard, even when you're feeling tense, so draw on that energy now. A day of focused effort should determine the outcome of any questions you may have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
