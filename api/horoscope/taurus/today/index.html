You don't have to let this momentary uneasiness make you terse and ill mannered. Loved ones would appreciate it if you'd maintain your usual good humor and simply talk out your worries. You'll find that someone nearby can help you out with your struggles. They could offer advice or assistance or a caring shoulder on which to lean.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
