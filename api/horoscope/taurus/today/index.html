    "horoscope": "Puttering around the house is just about your speed today. You want to make your surroundings comfortable, so do some cleaning or decorating. Change the sheets and plump up the couch cushions. Then sit down, put your feet up and enjoy your castle. You can also make a good, nourishing, home-cooked dinner, but try not to overeat. You do love your food,, and today you're particularly prone to overeating.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
