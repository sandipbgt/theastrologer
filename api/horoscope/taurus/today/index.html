    "horoscope": "Hard work and endurance are two of your greatest talents, and they're highlighted today. But your stubborn streak could also make an appearance, especially if you don't receive the attention or recognition you think you deserve. Whether you spend the day hard at work or surrounded by fun-loving friends, stay calm and good-humored. Don't take things personally,, and enjoy the simple gifts of nature that surround you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
