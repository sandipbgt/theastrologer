    "horoscope": "Your energy is constant and your flame doesn't waver. You're ready to tackle just about anything that comes your way. The only problem is, as ready as you are, there's just not a whole lot to do today. If you try too hard to exert your energy and vision anyway, you'll end up just spinning your wheels. However, don't give up just yet. There's a lot you can accomplish behind the scenes during this brief period of downtime, such as brainstorming and clean up. Prepare for the very near future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
