    "horoscope": "Dramatic behavior abounds today. This can be a positive thing or a challenging one. On the good side, people are laughing and giving spontaneous performances for their friends. You might do the same. You can be quite a ham, when your energy is up and your mood is sunny! But leave the drama out of heart-to-hearts and run-ins with people. Just be calm, honest and open.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
