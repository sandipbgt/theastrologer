    "horoscope": "Most people's emotions are stirred up today. For some, this is an uncomfortable experience, but for you, it could bring a powerful sense of connectedness with the people around you. You're more aware than ever of the links that bind you with your fellow humans, with other animals, and with theherself. This is a very grounding energy, and one that enables you to appreciate your life and your loved ones deeply.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
