    "horoscope": "You're filled with energy, and life's been a little hectic. Though you're feeling inspired, all you really want is a day of domestic tranquility. Is that really so difficult? Maybe, maybe not. Be sure to express your wishes in terms your roommates or family can understand. That means you'll have to be gentle and smooth any irritation when you ask them to quiet down or give you a little space. Don't neglect the power of compromise, either. You might need to adjust your approach or meet them halfway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
