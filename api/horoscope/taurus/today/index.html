    "horoscope": "Why are you so stubbornly retro? Clearly the style of some previous period is capturing your imagination. Whatever it is you're wearing or carrying around, it'll look good on you for today. Then what? Time marches on, wishes and demands change, and people will start judging old books by their covers. No, you don't have to give up what you love. But you might also benefit from having something more current in your life, too. Why not belong to a few different eras? And still be relevant today?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
