    "horoscope": "Your usually practical, grounded mind is in the clouds today. Your dreams are vivid, and when you're awake, your mind wanders into incredible fantasies. It's a good day to get some extra sleep, because your physical energy is low. Indulge in anything you find soothing -- a back rub or foot massage, a bubble bath or a midday snooze. Above all, if focus is elusive, allow yourself to take a mental vacation day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
