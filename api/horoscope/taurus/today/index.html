But wouldn't it be so much more honorable, not to mention humble, not to rub it in? Instead, be gracious. Everyone knows you had the right idea in the first place. Refrain from pointing that out. This will highlight your natural attractiveness, and it will make other people more likely to get behind you next time. And you're certainly practical enough to realize the value in that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
