Even if you have to keep a hundred different details straight, it won't be a problem. It's actually fun to stay mentally organized -- as if you're playing a challenging mind game! Every item you complete and cross off your list increases your self-confidence, and any mistake you make is a lesson learned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
