    "horoscope": "The slightly anxious, irritable mood you're in has you feeling needy and selfish. Maybe you're working a little harder, seeing dollar signs, or maybe you're spending a little too much on things you can't really afford. Either way, stop and honestly consider whether you're amassing wealth or just money-grubbing. Cast a stern eye on your own enterprises, and fix anything that looks bad as soon as you can. You'll bring on real feelings of relief and prosperity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
