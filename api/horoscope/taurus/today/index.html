    "horoscope": "You tend to avoid arguments, preferring a mellow, easygoing connection with other people. But today, it's a little too easy to get caught up in a squabble! Your stubborn streak is about a mile wide right now. You're ready and willing to prove your point no matter what. Just try to remember that the other person has a point, too -- and probably a good one. Settle down and look for common ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
