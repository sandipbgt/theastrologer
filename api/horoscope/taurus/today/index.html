    "horoscope": "Be yourself, by all means, but be sure to make yourself understood, too. Make it clear to others that you know what's what. Just don't make any further demands or plans today. Your past efforts are finally shifting into gear, so stand back and let them do their stuff. This is the time for appreciating the method to your madness and assuming everything will be OK. It's also a good networking moment if you're not too pushy. You're surrounded by people who could be very useful very soon. Be sure they know a little something about you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
