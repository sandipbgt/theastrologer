Whatever might be responsible for your large-living ways, stay conscious of your wealth and how you got it. This is a day for appreciating your good fortune instead of just flaunting it. Thank those who make it possible. Share with those who need a little something extra. Nobody's asking you to break the bank or spend all your time on charity cases, but a few kind gestures will put even more of a shine on your own happy life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
