You could go all authoritarian if you wanted to retain control, but showing muscle often escalates what could be solved more simply. Instead of amping it up, why not take things in the other direction? Try being calmer and friendlier today. Maybe you'll get through this mess unscathed. You'll definitely learn something. And that has to be worth something.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
