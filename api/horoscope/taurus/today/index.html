Next thought: If the present is unsettling, what does that say about your relationship with the future? Do you see a widening gap in that direction? If you don't want to become obsolete, boost your tolerance for new things. Your logic about all this might be flawed, you know. Rise above your conditioning and maybe even your principles. Your needs have changed since the last time you set these rules in stone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
