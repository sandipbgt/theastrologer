    "horoscope": "Your nurturing side is highlighted today. You're able to give strong, compassionate affection to your friends and family. What's more, you want to give it to them, especially in tangible ways like hugs and home-cooked meals. But those are really just symbols for the deep sentiment that lies beneath: caring and warm affection. Since many people are feeling moody and blue now, your understanding could be a real gift to someone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
