    "horoscope": "You're a mellow person, yet you have a possessive streak. Sometimes you want to grab hold of the people you love and never let go. This makes sense, since you adore cuddling and other physical expressions of closeness. But today, this could come up as a need for emotional intimacy. When you don't feel as close as you'd wish, try not to cling or make demands. That just compounds the issue.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
