    "horoscope": "Being charming isn't difficult for you, generally speaking. You're relaxed and friendly, which makes it easy to get along with old friends and new acquaintances alike. Draw on that mellow energy today. Avoid stubborn opinions or obstinate behavior. These are just obstacles to smooth interactions with your friends and coworkers! And the most important thing now is to work together. So do whatever it takes, within reason, to cooperate with others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
