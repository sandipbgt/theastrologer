    "horoscope": "You're in a chatty mood today. Everyone seems interesting, and you're enjoying your own clever wit, too. You may not get a lot accomplished, unless you're working on a project that relies on networking. Your focus is scattered at best. This is just one of those days when you're more talk and less action. At least you're gathering good ideas that you can put to practical use later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
