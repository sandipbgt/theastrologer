    "horoscope": "Don't be so theatrical about relationship problems. Yes, it's important to get your feelings out there, but this isn't your moment to strut in the spotlight across the stage of public opinion. There are strings attached here, and they'll get tangled if you keep making the wrong moves. Don't needlessly complicate your situation. And if you and the other party still aren't seeing eye to eye, a day apart might help things. Sometimes you can put a problem on the back burner and let it slow-cook its own solution. This may be one of those times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
