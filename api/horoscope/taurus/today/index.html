In this kind of mood, a second donut or a shopping spree starts to seem like a very good idea -- after all, you deserve it, don't you? You do deserve all the best things in life,-- everyone does. Still, try not to overeat or spend more than you can afford today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
