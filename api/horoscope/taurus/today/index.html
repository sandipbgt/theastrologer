    "horoscope": "It's another calm, focused day. You may not feel particularly social or lighthearted, but neither are you gloomy or pessimistic. You're simply in work mode, and it feels good. You know what needs to be done, and you're either working methodically toward a project's completion or you're making solid plans toward that end. Isn't it nice to know that the work you're doing now will withstand the test of time?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
