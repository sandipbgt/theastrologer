But you don't have to make this a public event just yet. It certainly could be. Still, let others tend their own gardens if they want, because you know how soothing and meditative it can be to work your plot. You could write a book on the excitement and rewards of this whole growth process. But cross-pollination is welcome, too. And if anyone feels like sharing, you're so ready.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
