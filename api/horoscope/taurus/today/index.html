    "horoscope": "Forget being lazy. That doesn't fit you now. Today, you're a constant source of new energy. You're ready to tackle anything life tosses your way, and more importantly, you're very much in the mood to start something new. Will this be a new project at home or work? Some creative endeavor? A relationship, even? Work on it with kindred spirits who come from the same place as you. You'll understand each other well, and you can help each other brainstorm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
