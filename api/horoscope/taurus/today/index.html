    "horoscope": "Today, it's as if you're hooked up to your very own celestial headphones, grooving on the steady beat of the universe. You're unflappable, and there's no reason to worry about anyone's performance or behavior but your own. You have a unique chance to improve something in your life, so take it. You can get ahead at work or on a creative project, or a relationship. You'll also enjoy this period's deep sleep and clear, strong energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
