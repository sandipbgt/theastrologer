    "horoscope": "Today should be serene, which is a relief if you were expecting another struggle. You've had some issues and challenges to overcome lately, and you've worked hard. You deserve to pat yourself on the back, but don't take this as an excuse to goof off. Make sure you keep your energy up, because there's work to be done. Once you've completed your to-do list, then you can kick back and congratulate yourself on a job well done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
