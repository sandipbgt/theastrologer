    "horoscope": "A grounded attitude makes your life easy today. Instead of trying to live up to impossible standards, you have a sense of what's workable and what isn't. You can move forward with confidence, because you know your projections are well founded. Anyone who might be observing your progress is sure to be impressed, but you aren't in this for the glory. The satisfaction of a job well done is reward enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
