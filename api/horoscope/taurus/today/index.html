    "horoscope": "Today, an inner sense of caution leads you toward traditional practices or methods. Cooking a family recipe for dinner brings you a feeling of comfort. So might wearing an item of clothing passed down from a family member, or taking the advice of a close friend. These seemingly minor acts are part of what connects you securely to your past. These are your roots, and they keep you grounded.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
