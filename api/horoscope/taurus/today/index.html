    "horoscope": "Being locked into a rigid life is no fun, but remember, it's only as boring as you let it be. It's highly likely that you'll find old ways of thinking or behaving no longer necessary, since they don't describe the person you are now. That should liven things up for you -- when it comes to making life more interesting, there's nothing like recognizing the need for internal change. Go easy on yourself as you make these changes, of course. Have fun with it instead of taking it on as yet another responsibility.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
