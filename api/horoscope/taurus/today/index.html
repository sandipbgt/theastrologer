    "horoscope": "Partnerships and close relationships take center stage today. It's especially important now to make decisions with everyone's best interests in mind. That may delay action as you work out a compromise, or it may force you to give something up in order to gain something else. But going that extra mile is invaluable now. At the very least, it will show your loved ones or coworkers that you're committed to working together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
