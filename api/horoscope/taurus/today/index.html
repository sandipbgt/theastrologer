So will your industrious habits, but make sure you don't bury your head in work today. You've got all the angles covered, and anything you do is sure to thrive. Spend time at home, reconnecting with yourself or with loved ones. A relaxing chat with someone important is always more fulfilling than working late at the office.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
