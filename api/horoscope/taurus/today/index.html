    "horoscope": "You have high standards today, but thank goodness for that grounded nature of yours. You won't pressure yourself to be perfect -- just very, very good. And that's a standard you can certainly attain. You also aren't one to submit to someone's unreasonable criticism. You know you've done a good job, and that's what counts. This feeling of inner peace -- being at one with yourself -- is a real confidence booster.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
