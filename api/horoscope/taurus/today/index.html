    "horoscope": "You've always been good at putting one foot in front of the other, but today, you've got that extra oomph. This is the perfect time to tackle a big project -- something you may have been putting off. Maybe clearing out your hall closet, or overhauling your garden, or breaking out the sewing machine? Don't ignore the passion that's simmering, either. It's a great time for fireworks with someone special. Most of all, don't be surprised if success knocks at your door, whether you were looking for it or not.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
