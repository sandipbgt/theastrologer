But if your stubborn streak rears its head, it's harder to keep the mood harmonious and relaxed. Avoid this by making a conscious effort to give other people plenty of leeway. If you really need to put your foot down about something, do so as gently as possible, and explain your reasons.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
