    "horoscope": "It's easy to connect with others at an emotional level today. It's almost as if your intuitive powers are heightened: You're able to tell how someone is feeling and relate to them at that level. A hug from a friend feels special, and sharing your thoughts and emotions is even more profound. You tend to live in your body, so enjoy a day or two of living and loving from the heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
