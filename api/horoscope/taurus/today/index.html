But when egos start getting in the way, clashes can result. Make sure you aren't the one causing all the drama! If you get hot under the collar about some issue, do your best to discuss it in a calm way. Avoid making mountains out of molehills.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
