    "horoscope": "Today, it's all up to you. An important project needs to be finished, and your extra creative drive makes you the best person for the job,. You can go harder than you have been lately, can't you? Sure you can! Show some devotion to your loved ones or colleagues by using your famous strength and determination to accomplish something important. That will prove to the world, and yourself, that you still have it in you. And that's a lesson that sometimes bears repeating.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
