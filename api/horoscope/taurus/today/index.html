    "horoscope": "You love relaxing so much that 'R and R' might as well be your middle name. But today is full of possibility -- stay alert! You might need to pounce on an opportunity (maybe even for romance). The good news is, you can be your charming, considerate self even as you focus on getting ahead. Whatever comes up, remember the old lesson -- be yourself. As long as you're honest and natural, everyone will respond favorably.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
