    "horoscope": "Many people are feeling more emotional today than usual. You probably are, too, and yet you're naturally grounded. In fact, you may be the rock your friends and family depend on when the going gets rough. If you're in that position today, accept it gracefully. Giving affection, encouragement and gentle advice comes easily when you're in this mood. It's a pleasure to support the people you care about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
