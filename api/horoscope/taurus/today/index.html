    "horoscope": "It's a good day to spend time with family and close friends -- the people who know you best and love you for who you are.  They already know and appreciate your strengths, and they don't mind your flaws, either. If you have to spend time with strangers or acquaintances now, don't worry about how they see you. Just be your humble, comfortable self. This helps others feel safe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
