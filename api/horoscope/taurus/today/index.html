    "horoscope": "You feel centered today. You're in the perfect frame of mind to work hard, especially at tasks that might normally seem unbearably tedious. This is the kind of energy you need for paying a stack of bills, filing paperwork or scrubbing your baseboards. You're willing to keep at it until the job is done. And you won't do anything halfway. Even minor details won't escape your notice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
