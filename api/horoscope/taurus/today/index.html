    "horoscope": "You'll be on active duty for another day, but don't be surprised -- or disappointed -- if you don't see a lot of action. Sure, you're feeling energetic and inspired, but the best way to use this brief period is for a little quiet time. Do stay alert, of course. Something might come up that needs your attention. But mostly, try to appreciate subtlety. Tune in to life's quieter rhythms, and pay attention to your own body and comfort. That way your strength will be rejuvenated when it's time to snap back to attention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
