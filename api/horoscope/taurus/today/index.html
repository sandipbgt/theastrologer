    "horoscope": "Your observant eye is sharp today. You're noticing minor details that might normally slip past you, or which you might usually file under 'no big deal.' It's not that they're a big deal now, either. It's that you can see the way many small details add up to create the big picture. This is a good thing, because it enables you to tweak things at that small-scale level, and positively affect the overall result.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
