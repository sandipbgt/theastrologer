After all, if a routine is working for you, why change it? But sometimes, it's important to switch things up, purely for the sake of change. That time is now. Go on -- don't be scared to push the boundaries a little! Try something new. Get some fresh energy flowing in your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
