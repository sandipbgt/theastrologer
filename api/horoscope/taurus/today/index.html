    "horoscope": "Compromise and cooperation are key concepts today. These may not be your most well-developed qualities, but you certainly see how they smooth the flow of human interaction. The importance of getting along with others isn't lost on you, either, and today you can see others' points of view more easily than usual. You may even be able to negotiate a disagreement between mutual friends. Your gentle, kind spirit is just what they need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
