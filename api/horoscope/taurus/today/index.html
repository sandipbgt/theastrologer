    "horoscope": "Love is a constant in your life. As alone as you might sometimes feel, you have strong bonds with your loved ones, and you work hard to keep them strong. Today is a good day to reaffirm those bonds. Spend time with a close friend, or call a relative on the phone to check in with them. If you're dealing with family matters right now, you can offer a compassionate, levelheaded perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
