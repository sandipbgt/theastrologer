Anything you do today will stick for at least a month, if not longer. Even if others ignore your kindness or take it for granted, don't give up. Move on right away. You've earned the right to sit back and admire your handiwork. You're doing OK, so give yourself a pat on the back. Anyone who understands genuine pride will have to forgive you for being so self-satisfied.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
