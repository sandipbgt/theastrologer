    "horoscope": "Suddenly things are coming together for you. Your inborn skills are rising up to support your recent training. Maybe your parents and teachers were right after all. Would it hurt to admit that much? You might want to give them a call today. Meanwhile, calm down after your first flush of excitement. Even though chances and rewards are everywhere, don't start your lucky month by scaring them off with random grabs and awkward comments.
