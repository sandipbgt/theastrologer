    "horoscope": "Today marks the start of your personal monthly cycle, so revel in your current energy. Colors and textures matter, and will continue to. If anyone knows how to blend without clashing, it's you. That's true in your artistic projects as well as your relationships with friends and work mates. You're especially graceful now, because you're feeling so centered. This is a great time to surround yourself with comfort and beauty, and take pleasure in watching it spread to others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
