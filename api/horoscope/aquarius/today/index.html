    "horoscope": "You spend a lot of time in your head, exploring the realm of ideas. Today, it's time to get grounded in your physical self. Taking a walk or other forms of exercise are a good way to get in touch with your body. Eating wholesome foods that bring you sensory pleasure is another. And if you share a meal with friends, that's best of all!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
