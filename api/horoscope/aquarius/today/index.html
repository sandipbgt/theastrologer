    "horoscope": "Be alert and ready to move. Don't be afraid to voice your opinions about who's truly free and who's enslaved to what. Show that you're determined to make things right for everyone. So are you a seer and a savior, or a micro-manager and a busybody? Does it matter? As far as you're concerned, it's out with the old and in with the new. Just one day of this mood will turn your world around, or at least rearrange the furniture. Coffee might help you achieve this state, although it's amazing what can happen naturally if you tune in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
