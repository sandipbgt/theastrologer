    "horoscope": "It's a wonderful day for exploring your spiritual nature. Under the current cosmic influence, you're highly attuned at this level. You're open to subtle insights, and meditation or yoga could lead to a real breakthrough. It's also a great day for visiting a place of worship, whether that's a temple or a church, or a more private place where you like to go in order to get in touch with your higher self.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
