For one thing, there's nothing you have to prove here. If you venture out into the wide world, you might run into a stranger who challenges you to show off your brilliant mind. Expending your energy that way would be a waste of time. You've already got projects underway that need your attention, and friends and family who could use some time with you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
