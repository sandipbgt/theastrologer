    "horoscope": "Your friendships feel closer than ever. Connecting with the people you love fills your soul with happiness and gratitude. Today, you'll touch your loved ones' spirits with trust and laughter, and you'll all remember it later on. This could turn out to be very positive for you at some point in the future, when you need a friend's aid, advice, or other support. Because you were there for them,, they'll be there for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
