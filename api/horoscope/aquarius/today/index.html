But it's also important to remember that yours isn't the only valid point of view in the room. If you're working on your own today, you'll get a lot done, because no one is standing in your way. But if you have to cooperate with others, try to be flexible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
