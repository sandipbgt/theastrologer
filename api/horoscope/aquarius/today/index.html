    "horoscope": "The real world calls you today. Instead of making plans for a bright, fascinating future, it's time to deal with the here and now. This might mean tending to tangible responsibilities, such as caring for relatives or putting in hard, focused effort at work. Or it might mean something deeper and more philosophical -- accepting your life as it is, rather than focusing on how you wish it could be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
