    "horoscope": "Your instincts are honed by the current energy, which emphasizes the intangible side of life -- those feelings and experiences that can't be explained away with logic, or divided into classifications of 'right' and 'wrong.' It's an excellent day to study subjects like music, photography or spirituality. Anything complicated or open to interpretation appeals to you in its sheer ambiguity. You're also attracted to subjects that speak to your creative side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
