You're feeling stubborn and annoyed, especially when a friend or loved one seems to demand closeness from you that you aren't in the mood to give. Your best bet today might be to put your head down and work hard on your own projects. Interacting with other people could be too tricky.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
