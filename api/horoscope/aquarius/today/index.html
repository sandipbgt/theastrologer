    "horoscope": "Stay focused on an important goal today, and access your talent for working long and hard at something you believe in. If you have to attend a meeting, be nice -- even if someone's overly traditional ideas get under your skin. The same goes for a dinner date with friends or your sweetie. Most of the world is in an amiable mood today. It's not their fault you aren't feeling the same way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
