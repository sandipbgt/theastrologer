    "horoscope": "The key to your success may lie in other people, and you're comfortable with that. You enjoy working with others, because group efforts are often the most successful, and you don't need all the glory for yourself. Talk today with people who can help advance your cause, such as friends, coworkers or investors who might be interested in the project you're planning. People are impressed by your creativity, and they're feeling cooperative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
