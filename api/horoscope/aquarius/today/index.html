    "horoscope": "Teamwork is favored today, whether you're working on a personal project or something with a broader scope. Gathering with other people and pushing toward a common goal inspires a wonderful sense of community -- even if that common goal is as simple and silly as winning a pickup softball game! There are real benefits to having fun with your friends and neighbors. Building that bond now pays off later, in tougher times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
