    "horoscope": "You might have the cool-as-a-cucumber act down pat, but your closest friends know how passionate you are when it comes to your interests and your intimate relationships.

Turn secrets into moments of delicious discovery.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
