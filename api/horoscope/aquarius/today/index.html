Ideas spark inside your mind like small lightning flashes. There's no way you could come up with so many strokes of genius without brainstorming with other people. So go to work, attend a party or call a friend on the phone. Keep talking and making connections.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
