    "horoscope": "Does affection equal love? Do some promises come with expiration dates? Today, at least, people can depend on you being here, whether you're supporting them or just conveniently on site. But whether or not your heart is in this whole thing may be a different matter. If it's because you don't know how to behave under the weight of these expectations, take a chance and learn by doing. If you have previous commitments that won't let you stay here, honor them. Follow-through is important, and being fickle as the wind won't help anyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
