    "horoscope": "You're feeling a little more emotional today than usual. And you probably aren't used to this! You typically spend more time exploring ideas than feelings. Intellectual concepts are a more comfortable commodity for you, since they can be more easily analyzed and codified than messy, irrational emotions. Still, don't shy away from your feelings or anyone else's. Acknowledge them and treat them as valid, even if you don't understand them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
