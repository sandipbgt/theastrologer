    "horoscope": "You're used to being the mover and shaker when it comes to brainstorming proposals and finishing up projects. Today, though, be thrifty and don't strain your brain. There's no shame or harm in letting machines and computers do the heavy lifting. Why not just take it easy? You work so hard that you've earned this little break. And it's not as if you'll have this brief period completely off. There are still meetings to attend, items to tick off your to-do list and more. Just don't try to take more upon your own shoulders than you can reasonably handle.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
