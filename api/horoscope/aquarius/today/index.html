You think you're being reasonable, but they think you're being stubborn and uncooperative. Working on your own may be the best choice, but keep compromise in mind as a possibility, too. You wouldn't want to alienate your friends and allies. If you find your methods aren't working, you'll want to rejoin the group again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
