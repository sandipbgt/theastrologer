    "horoscope": "You aren't a combative person by nature. But today you have a competitive edge that can help you meet any challenge. In fact, in high-pressure situations, you shine. It's as if the higher stakes make you think more clearly. Suddenly you're making good, quick decisions. And you aren't second-guessing yourself! This certainty and self-confidence helps you act decisively, which is a real bonus under the current cosmic influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
