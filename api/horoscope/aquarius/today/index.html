It doesn't matter, as long as you maintain a sense of exploration in whatever you're doing. Rules and restrictions don't seem as limiting as usual today. If they  present serious obstacles to your adventures, you can probably find creative ways of getting around them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
