The stakes are higher, which means your investment is greater. Still, you're embracing the brother- and sisterhood of humanity, and you know you can pull this off. You just can't do it by yourself. If you try a method that doesn't work, don't worry. Just try a different approach. After all, this is just a trial period.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
