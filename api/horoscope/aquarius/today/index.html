    "horoscope": "Today is a good time to connect with your own watery energy. Let it flow subtly and beautifully by meditating on the movement and quality ofitself -- that free-flowing thing that meanders wherever it can. That's how your thoughts should work. Don't curtail your imagination or impose any expectations of practicality on yourself, especially if you're developing ideas for a project. Let your mind flow. Take notes on where it leads you. Most of all, don't be lured by loud, shiny novelties. You don't need them. The best stuff comes unannounced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
