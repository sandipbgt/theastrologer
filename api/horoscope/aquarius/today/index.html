    "horoscope": "Your maverick nature is wonderfully on display today. A new personal cycle begins for you now, and your energy is boosted by the cosmos. It's a great day to break new ground, whether in your work, in your thinking, or perhaps in a relationship. A theory you've been developing is ready to be put to the test. It's also a good time to make plans for a better tomorrow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
