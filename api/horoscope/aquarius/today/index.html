    "horoscope": "It's okay if you feel like withdrawing from the hubbub of life today. This is a good day for laying low and gathering your strength. Spending time with people you love and trust feels restorative, as if you're repairing your soul. Taking a nap or getting to bed early is also a good idea. Think of this as a brief respite before the pace of life picks up once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
