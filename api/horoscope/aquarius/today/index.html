    "horoscope": "Don't fault yourself if you want to spend the day relaxing or daydreaming. It's hard right now to concentrate on mundane tasks. But if you're working on a project that involves creativity, it could go very well. You're in a highly imaginative frame of mind. Otherwise, allow your mind to wander. It's a good day for napping, reading or listening to music. All of these will feed your creative muse.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
