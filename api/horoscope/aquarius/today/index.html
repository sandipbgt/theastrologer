Life isn't about editing the story to your own advantage. It's about communicating openly and clearly so that other people can benefit from your fresh data.  Everyone deserves some understanding of the situation and a fair shot at the prize. And you're just the person to provide it for them today. Don't worry, this won't lessen your own position. It could even earn you karmic brownie points from the universe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
