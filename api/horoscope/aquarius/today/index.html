    "horoscope": "You may be a people person by nature, but you also have a private side, and that side dominates today. You prefer now to do your work in secret. Issues of trust or confidentiality could come up, either in a personal or a professional relationship. Ask for what you need, and listen when the other person states their own needs. Communicating in a direct, calm way helps when you're working through complex issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
