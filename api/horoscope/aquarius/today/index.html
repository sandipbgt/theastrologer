It would be easier just to be like everyone else, but the world is better off with you in it, just the way you are. There's no need for you to be so sensitive. Other people want variety, and that's exactly what makes you a bright spot in anyone's day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
