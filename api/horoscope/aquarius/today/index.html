    "horoscope": "If you find yourself doing and saying outrageous things today, know that your inhibitions are making you unreasonable. It's time to inspect your fears and worries, and finally break out of this loop. Even if a certain situation or relationship seems tricky, you still have plenty of time to salvage things. Just be fair, open-minded, and as easygoing as possible. Treating people with respect will take you much further than rudeness or condescension.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
