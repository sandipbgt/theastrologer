    "horoscope": "You're in a changeable mood. Up is down, in is out, and at any moment you might come out of your closet wearing a totally different outfit. Your answers run from 'why not?' to 'no comment' and 'whatever.' You like to keep them guessing just because you can. Luckily, others seem to tolerate your idiosyncrasies. See if they'll actually follow you today, and whether it's out of curiosity or maybe even loyalty. And maybe, before it's all over, you could even have them worshipping at your feet. That would be a nice little extra if you could manage it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
