Just do your best to get into the warm, nurturing mood everyone else seems to be in. There's nothing wrong with spending a little time at home with your family, you know. You deserve some support, too. The truth is, you're feeling just a bit vulnerable, and time spent alone or with loved ones will help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
