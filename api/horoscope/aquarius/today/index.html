Spending time with friends old and new is attractive -- but making headway toward your goals sounds even more enticing. Perhaps you can blend the two by asking someone for help, or just for a friendly, interested ear. People enjoy being your sounding board, because your ideas are so innovative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
