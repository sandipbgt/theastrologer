    "horoscope": "This could be a moody day. Your emotions are stronger than usual, or maybe they're just more noticeable. At any rate, it's harder to ignore them -- and that would be a disservice to yourself, anyway. Strong feelings might make you uncomfortable, especially if you can't put your finger on their source. But it's important to experience them anyway. Believe it or not, they enrich your life by increasing your empathy for others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
