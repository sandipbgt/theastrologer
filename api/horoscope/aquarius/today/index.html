    "horoscope": "Curiosity is alive and well in your corner of the world. That flickering on the edge of your vision might be your own sparkling personality and shining intellect. Will this get you noticed today? You bet it will. Other people's reactions will strike a chord with you, no matter what song they're singing. Focus on all the things you have in common, even if it's just a love of the uncommon. Asking the right questions will open useful doors and hook you into lucky accidents. You did say you wanted to be more involved, right?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
