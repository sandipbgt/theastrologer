    "horoscope": "You take a broad view of life today. You aren't concerned with the small stuff -- the minor details that don't matter much in the grand scheme of things. Instead, you're interested in the big picture. Consider your future, or the long-range effects of your current work or imaginings. If you get a little idealistic, that's a good thing. Envisioning a perfect future enables you to create it as faithfully as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
