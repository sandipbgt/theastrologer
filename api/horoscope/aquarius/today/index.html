Maybe you think you can get more done if you fly solo. Either way, it's okay, but you know you're going to have to engage sooner or later. So why not do so now? A warm bond is so much more fun than aloof, distance. Instead of pushing people away, remember why you like them so much.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
