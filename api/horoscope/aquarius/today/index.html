Unorthodox ideas might appeal to you, but under the current influence, they'll probably just amount to reinventing the wheel. You're better off sticking to established rules and routines. Getting the job done right is more important right now than getting it done creatively. Plus, doing it that way takes less time, which is a real bonus.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
