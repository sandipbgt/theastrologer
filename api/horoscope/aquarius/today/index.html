    "horoscope": "Emotional overreactions are common today. Lots of people are getting caught up in tense power struggles and dramatic displays of ego. You can spot situations like that a mile away, and you're smart enough to steer clear. But don't be surprised if you get swept up in it anyway. You might even compound the issue by being your headstrong self. Remember, one good way to defuse tension is to be the first to compromise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
