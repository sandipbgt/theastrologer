    "horoscope": "Keep thinking in creative and innovative ways today, but don't ignore the benefits of a traditional approach. You might impress your employer or a potential client more if they can see that you're hardworking and conservative with your resources. Be thrifty with your money and your time, and maintain a serious outlook. Tomorrow, you can loosen up and have some fun. Today is for applying yourself to a project and seeing it through to completion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
