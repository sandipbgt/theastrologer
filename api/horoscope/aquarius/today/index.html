    "horoscope": "It's easy to get absorbed in your duties today, especially if you have a lot on your task list. But this could cause issues in your personal relationships, and even more so if you're naturally somewhat aloof. The current cosmic energy makes people less emotionally expressive. You might simply forget to treat your friend or sweetheart with warm affection. Fulfilling responsibilities is important, but so is connecting at that human level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
