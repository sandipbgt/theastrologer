    "horoscope": "Defensiveness sneaks into your interactions today, making them more unpleasant than they need to be. If you stop and think about it, you'll realize there's nothing to protect yourself against. Your life is going pretty well, and you have good friends and a support system in place to help you through the rough spots. Focus on these positives instead of any negatives you may be experiencing. You'll get through this with flying colors.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
