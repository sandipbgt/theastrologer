    "horoscope": "You want to be close with someone today, but you don't realize how aloof you seem to them. Perhaps you're worried that you can't be as near to them as you'd like, so you're holding yourself apart, even as you're reaching out. Try to be honest  about your own feelings and worries first, so that you can be honest with other people, too. Baring your soul brings you closer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
