    "horoscope": "You're moody and passionate today, as if your inner teenager has come to the fore. Is this such a bad thing? You aren't used to such emotional extremes, but it's nice to know what you're actually feeling about a certain person or situation. Perhaps you can coax your inner artist to join forces with your inner teenager. Write some angst-filled poetry or an entry in your journal. Clarify your feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
