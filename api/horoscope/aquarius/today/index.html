    "horoscope": "Today you'd prefer to be alone, out of the public view and away from prying eyes. That way, you can do exactly what you want. You're feeling a bit self-centered, and you want to indulge your whims if you feel like it. That's fine, but will you respect others in the process? That's an important question for someone as people-oriented as you,. Focus more on your friends and surroundings. They count, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
