    "horoscope": "When you go out, go all the way out. Put your best self on display just because you can. New friends may think you're bizarre, but what do they know? You can be anything you want today, even if that means contradicting what you were yesterday. Why not try something different? Amuse, surprise, shock or blind-side those who thought they knew you. That includes you, too. When you set yourself up as a master of the unexpected, you'll open the door for learning and growing experiences. Don't worry. It'll be as fun as you let it be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
