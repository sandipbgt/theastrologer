Of course, you're ultra-sensitive to any type of restriction, so this certainly doesn't sit well with you. Whether it's something as straightforward as a traffic jam or as complicated as a relationship doesn't matter. It's not the exact situation that matters as much as your reaction to it. Go for the mature, civilized approach today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
