    "horoscope": "You're especially sensitive today, in all senses of the word. Your feelings might be a bit tender, but you're also more aware than usual that other people are also feeling vulnerable. This should help you get through any rough emotional spot of your own. There's a sense of universality, as if we're all in this together. Furthermore, any feelings of sadness or confusion should dissipate quickly, like mist under sunlight.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
