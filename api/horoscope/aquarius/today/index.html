There's certainly a big part of you that wants to do things your own way, rather than being defined or held back by the past. Today, you may have to confront these issues in some way. Perhaps you'll realize you owe more to your family than you thought. Or perhaps you'll have to take a stand, rejecting some element of your past once and for all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
