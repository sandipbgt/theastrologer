    "horoscope": "You're a free spirit today. Don't get tied up with people or situations that limit you, because you'll really chafe at those bonds. Instead, spend time with people who encourage you to think for yourself. Tackle projects that challenge your mind and push you to come up with new, creative methods or solutions. The satisfaction you derive from letting your thoughts roam is immense. The worst thing you could do now would be to underestimate yourself!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
