    "horoscope": "Humor is an extraordinary thing. You've seen what it can do, but you should start paying attention again. That stranger on the street could turn into your friend, for a moment or forever, if the same joke hits you both on the funny bone. Those rumbling dark clouds in your sky will develop giggling silver linings. A good laugh can pull you into your body and into the moment. Try to stay in this place today. Spreading the laughs around could only help. Remember, it's all in the timing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
