    "horoscope": "You've always demanded freedom, and enjoy being ahead of the trends. But that stubborn streak likes a structured life. Go figure! Now's the perfect time to give that small, conventional facet of your personality the stability it craves. Rather than setting off in some brand-new, untried direction, spend today finishing up current projects. Work with all the focus and diligence you have. Then, in a few days, you can see what happens when you've cleared the decks of old business, inspiration is at its peak, and you're raring to go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
