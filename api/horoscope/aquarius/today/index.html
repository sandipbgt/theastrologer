Maybe there's something weird about this, but you're resourceful enough to make the best out of a strange situation. Things like this have happened to you before, and you can still look back and laugh. So the world has thrown you yet another opportunity. Recognize and realize your potential ASAP. Be the right person in the right place at the right time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
