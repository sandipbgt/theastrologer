Either way, you probably aren't comfortable with this feeling. You'd rather stick to 'safe territory' -- thoughts, ideas, plans. Emotions are just too tricky. But if something rises to the surface of your consciousness today, it probably needs to be faced, felt and dealt with.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
