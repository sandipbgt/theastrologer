    "horoscope": "It's a great day to delve into passionate feelings. You might normally steer clear of such murky depths, but now they seem to draw you in. Desire becomes obsession. Thank goodness you're a levelheaded person. You can explore the intensity without taking it to dark extremes, the way some people do. And if things do get a little dark, don't worry. Intensity of feeling is fleeting. Life will lighten up soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
