And it's certainly still there, even if you're in a tough spot emotionally. Spending time with someone you love and trust can really help you feel better. If you're on your own for the day, pamper yourself with good food and plenty of sleep.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
