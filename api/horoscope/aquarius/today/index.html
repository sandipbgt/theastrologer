    "horoscope": "You're here to beguile and astound. It's all those new ideas you keep throwing down. Your personal style probably has something to do with their amazement, too. Whatever your intention, for today you'll manage to distract others while focusing on what matters to you. Keep it an open secret so no one comes back later with the idea that you were trying to scam them. You're certainly skilled enough to sucker people in, but you're way too honorable -- aren't you? Keep it real and all above board.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
