    "horoscope": "If you feel low-energy today or uncertain about some aspect of your life, it's best not to push it. There's no need to throw yourself into strenuous pursuits now; you'll only tire yourself out. And if you can't seem to make a decision, it's probably because there are still too many variables to mull over. Give yourself permission to withdraw today from anything fast-paced or challenging. You deserve a break.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
