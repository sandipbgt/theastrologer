    "horoscope": "You're caught today in an odd push-pull between your urge for recognition and your desire to be independent. Somehow, the two aren't compatible at the moment, and it's hard to choose which to pursue. You want to feel personally liberated and empowered, but you also want everyone to know you're a force to be reckoned with. Coming on too strong will push others away instead of drawing them close.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
