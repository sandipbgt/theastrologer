Show your gratitude by engaging with the world in a fresh way. Take in some artwork, or try your hand at a creative project of your own. Play devil's advocate in a conversation with friends. Creativity and challenge go hand in hand now, and both feel wonderful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
