Sloppy work won't cut it, either. Make a workable plan and then stick to it for the greatest efficiency. This may not leave much room for creativity or innovation, but it's only for a day. Toeing that line proves your maturity and dedication.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
