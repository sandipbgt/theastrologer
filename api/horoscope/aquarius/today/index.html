Seeing a stray animal by the road or hearing someone's hard luck story may inspire you to change things for the better. Stay with this line of thought. See where it takes you. It's possible that no practical ideas will emerge, since the current energy is highly idealistic. But perhaps something workable will come to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
