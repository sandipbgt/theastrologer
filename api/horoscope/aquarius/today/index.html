    "horoscope": "There's a bounce in your step today, and when you speak, you're animated. You gesture with your hands, describing big ideas not just with words, but with the expression on your face and the movements of your whole body. You're excited, that's for sure! You're buoyant with the enthusiasm that comes with being turned on by new possibilities. Perhaps soon you'll start down a brand-new path, one you hadn't even seen until now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
