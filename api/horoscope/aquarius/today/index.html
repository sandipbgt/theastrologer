Everyone's spirits are running high. The people you meet will be fascinating at the very least, and could actually become good friends. Make an effort to be tolerant. Start a conversation with someone you wouldn't ordinarily talk to. Reach out to a whole new world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
