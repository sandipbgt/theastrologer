Your mind is alert and your mood positive, so you're able to be tolerant of everything and everyone you see. Creative projects go well now, especially those you tackle in collaboration with someone else. Visiting someplace you've never been before will help you keep your perspective broad.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
