    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if you feel a little moody today. Tricky emotions could rise to the surface of your consciousness, demanding to be acknowledged. If this happens, dismissing or ignoring your feelings won't work. It's best just to face things so you can process them. You may have a hard time putting your emotions into words, but it's a good idea to talk them out  if possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
