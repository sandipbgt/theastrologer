    "horoscope": "If you find yourself feeling unusually moody today, take note. It may mean you have some deep-rooted feelings that you haven't faced or processed yet. The only trouble is, this isn't the best day for working through your emotional wounds. Your perspective is highly subjective. It's hard to stay levelheaded when someone hurts your feelings. It actually might be better to sit on your feelings for a few days, to gain clarity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
