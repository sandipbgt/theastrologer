    "horoscope": "An abundance of poise and charm highlight your natural talents, of which there are many. Yes, everyone in your life knows you're special, and your perspective on things holds a lot of weight. Still, don't hesitate to listen to and compromise with other people. You need their support, and you're likely to find that they're just as unique, informed and creative as you are. They may even have better ideas on your current project than you do!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
