    "horoscope": "Come out of the world of ideas today and join the physical realm. Sometimes you might forget you have a physical self! But the current cosmic energy is perfect for all things physical, including work and exercise. It's also a good time to break bread with friends. You may find your appetite is especially strong. Consider this a day of physical sustenance that will prepare you for the next mental project.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
