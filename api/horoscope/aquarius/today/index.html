You've got better things to do with your time, such as moving forward toward a very bright, interesting future. You can go far now if you put a little effort into it. Connect with friends old and new, and bounce ideas off each other. See where your collective imagination can take you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
