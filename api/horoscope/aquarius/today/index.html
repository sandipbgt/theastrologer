    "horoscope": "The world seems to have gone crazy today, and in a tough moment you might think you're surrounded by drama queens. If so, try to remember that, although you're uncomfortable with intense emotional displays, they aren't always a bad thing. Maybe one of your loved ones needs to get something off their chest. Or maybe you've been repressing something deep and dark, yourself. If so, talk about it. Don't keep it bottled up."
