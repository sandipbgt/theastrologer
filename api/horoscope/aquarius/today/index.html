    "horoscope": "You sense deep changes occurring within you, and that may make you nervous. You just aren't that comfortable with change, or with heavy emotions! But if you feel at all gloomy today, know that it's just a phase that will pass soon. Treat any deep-rooted fears, insecurities or desires that arise as interesting clues to your own subconscious. It's perfectly okay to take a scientific view of your psyche!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
