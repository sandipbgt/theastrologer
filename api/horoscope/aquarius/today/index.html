    "horoscope": "Be bold today, and tap into your creativity. Your imagination is on fire, stimulated by the current cosmic energy boost. A burst of passion could help you push through a project.

If someone needs to express their feelings, hang in there. It's just that kind of day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
