    "horoscope": "Your stubborn streak flares today, getting in the way of smooth interactions. Normally you're good at getting along with other people, but now someone's simple request could get under your skin, so you resist cooperating with them. Even if you know it's silly, that's just the kind of mood you're in. Try your best to get along anyway,. Teamwork is normally one of your strong points.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
