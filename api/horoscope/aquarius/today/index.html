You certainly have good advice to offer. Your perspective is both balanced and logical. Plus you're able to dream up creative, clever solutions to long-standing problems. There's a side benefit here, too -- offering assistance makes you feel better about yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
