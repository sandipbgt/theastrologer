    "horoscope": "Today you're a little stingy with both praise and time. It's not like you to hold back in this way. Are you worried about guilt or genius by association? Anything could happen with the people surrounding you, and your independent nature is balking at the idea that this might reflect on you. It doesn't have to, but do remember that all things are connected. You reflect on others, too. Loosen up with your praise and your resources.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
