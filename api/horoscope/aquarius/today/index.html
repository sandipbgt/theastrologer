    "horoscope": "Today's celestial spotlight is on the past. Old emotional issues may come to light again, even if you'd thought you'd dealt with them. Or long-standing family problems could take center stage. If there's something in your own past that you need to process, now's the time. It may not be very enjoyable, but it's the only way to move forward. This is also a fine time to make amends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
