    "horoscope": "Anarchy is a primitive urge, even if it seems like a good idea. Maybe you don't trust authority, but don't buy the illusion that all people can be trusted, either. The modern world is too complicated for everyone to share your idea of community. Plus there's always some freeloader looking out for number one. You're not that one rotten apple threatening to spoil the whole barrel. But you could be the one who lets it in through your good intentions. Raise your social consciousness today with a healthy mix of doubt and hope. You'll figure it out soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
