    "horoscope": "Your sense of humor is as sharp as your mind today. You're making mental connections with the agility of a gymnast. Share your wit and creativity with other people. If you're part of a brainstorming group, you have a lot to contribute. But simply being social is fun now, too. A stimulating conversation with a friend is an enjoyable way to invest your time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
