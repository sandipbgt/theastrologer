    "horoscope": "It's hard for you to be this careful and rational in your work, but keep it up for another day. Your creative, progressive soul wants to break free, but logically, you know there's a job to be done, and the best way to do it is by taking the slow-and-steady route. Though following the rules makes you want to jump out of your skin, sometimes, that's simply what's required of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
