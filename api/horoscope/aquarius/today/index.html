    "horoscope": "Today, you have the energy to do just about anything. The current influence is perfect for fun and adventure. But if you can channel your high spirits into something of greater importance, such as your work or a favorite cause, so much the better. You're a uniter, so take charge now by getting a group of people together. You'll find they're open to direction if you keep things enjoyable and fast-paced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
