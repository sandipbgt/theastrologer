    "horoscope": "Attention to detail is important today. You might feel nervous and tense as you try to keep track of everything -- what time you're due at a certain appointment, what needs signing, filing or mailing out... And the list goes on. Just do your best, but try not to get too caught up in the small stuff. If you do, it won't solve anything. And you'll just end up driving yourself to distraction!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
