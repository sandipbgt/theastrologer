Find a benign way to change the scenery of your life. Satisfy that urge for new experiences with something fresh and exciting. Otherwise, you might end up overhauling something purely for the sake of change itself! Improve the existing systems of your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
