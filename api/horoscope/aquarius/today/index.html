    "horoscope": "You feel even freer today than usual. There's nothing holding you back from what you want to do with this wonderful sense of energy and possibility. The world is your playground, and you feel like exploring some new territory. Take advantage of this optimistic feeling while you have it, because experience shows that the real world will intrude before very long. In other words, party on while there's still time!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
