    "horoscope": "An emotional scene makes you uncomfortable today. Your first instinct is to ignore it, or shut down and withdraw. Why should you deal with such an irrational person or situation? There's a good answer for that: Because it's part of life. Sometimes, relationships hit sticky patches. People are emotional beings -- even you,. Be grateful you can feel things so deeply. Revel in the feeling connections you share with other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
