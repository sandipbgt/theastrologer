Anything aimed at creating a better, cleaner life for yourself and your loved ones is favored now. This might include eating healthier foods, spending less money, exercising more often or cleaning your home more regularly. Whichever area of your life needs attention, give it your focus. Make a workable plan.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
