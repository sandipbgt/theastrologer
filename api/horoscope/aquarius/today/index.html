    "horoscope": "You're in a warm and idealistic mood, perfect for gathering with your friends and loved ones. Your energy is high and you aren't content with lounging on the couch at home, so this is no time to go it alone. If you attend a dinner party, the conversation promises to be lively! Since your focus is on connecting with different people, let some of your goodwill spill over onto everyone you encounter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
