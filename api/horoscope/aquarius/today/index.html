    "horoscope": "You love people and you're a true humanitarian, but sometimes you hold yourself apart from others. You can seem aloof or even uncaring, though that's far from the truth. Today, access your warm, affectionate side. Call or get together with the people you care about most, and let them know you love them. This could be the start of a brand-new you, Aquarius. Be the person you hope to be for the rest of your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
