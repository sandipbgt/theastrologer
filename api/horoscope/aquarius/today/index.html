That's good enough for now, but look beyond the moment, too. There's a bigger reason for what's happening to you. Getting through this will be one small triumph, but you don't have to tough it out every time, you know. If you can see what's coming, you'll see a way around it, too. Farsighted people are already mapping out possible future routes. Benefit from their data and add your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
