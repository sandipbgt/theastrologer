Maybe there's actually -- gasp -- a method to their madness. Now, that's revolutionary! This kind of open-minded thinking is your entrance to a more positive life. Move on through to the other side, friend. A brand-new, enlightened perspective awaits you, as soon as you're willing to embrace it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
