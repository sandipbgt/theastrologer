    "horoscope": "Welcome to your fifteen minutes of fame right in the middle of your finest hour. You're feeling leisurely, creative and at the apex of civilization. Instead of just wiggling your toes in the sand and mapping out your next vacation, show the world why you're such a cultural asset . And why they should all keep applauding and throwing money! Come up with brilliant ideas that work for someone else, too. Earn your keep today, if only to prove you're still as great as you say. Do this and no one will be disappointed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
