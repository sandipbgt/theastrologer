But today, there's just no way to predict the personal effects of being that, well, out-there. Right now, a better, more fulfilling approach to life is to stay in touch with your true feelings. Are you in love? Connect with your honey. Is there a friend you adore? Let them know how much you care. Today is about warm connection, not separation or abstraction.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
