    "horoscope": "Sometimes you like being on your own, but not today. Don't turn down any invitations to dinner parties or other get-togethers. You're in the mood for interesting company and conversation, and any gathering you attend should feed your high energy. People enjoy talking with you because you have such a unique perspective, and you're also sincerely interested in hearing their points of view. Don't be surprised if you make a new friend today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
