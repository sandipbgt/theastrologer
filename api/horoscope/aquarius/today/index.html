    "horoscope": "Good news! Today, you're easygoing and in a great mood, both quick-witted and slow to anger. Keep it up by keeping things light and positive. Get together with friends and trade laughter and stories. At work, you can make great strides, especially if you give fresh approaches a chance. You're creative enough to see the worth in trying something new, and you're people-oriented enough to know you can rely on your friends and coworkers.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
