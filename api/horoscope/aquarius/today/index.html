    "horoscope": "Your confidence level skyrockets, because other people -- your friends, neighbors and coworkers, even complete strangers on the street -- are noticing just how uniquely appealing you are. Let your individuality shine today, and let your intellect rock the world. You could change everything if you just gave your incredible ideas free rein. How can you afford not to? The answer is, you can't. So shine like the star you are, and see just how much you can accomplish.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
