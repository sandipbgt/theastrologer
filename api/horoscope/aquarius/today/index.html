That's just the nature of the current cosmic energy, which is quite dreamy in its influence. But don't get frustrated with your inability to focus. Your imagination is likely to take you in some strange and wonderful, if you'll simply follow its lead. Don't try to control it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
