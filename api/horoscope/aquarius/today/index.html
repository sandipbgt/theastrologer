    "horoscope": "Today you're drawn to spiritual pursuits. Simple scientific explanations don't satisfy you now. You want to look more deeply than that into life's mysteries. Participate in activities that help you look beyond logic to the more magical side of life. It's also a good day to visit any place of reverence or worship that's meaningful to you, whether that's a church, a temple or a mountaintop.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
