    "horoscope": "Your partnerships could seem fraught with complications today. It might seem tempting to strike out on your own, but don't forget that you benefit from the input of your partner. If things aren't going that well between you, take a step back and admit to yourself that you're part of the problem. Stubbornness and autocratic decision-making won't help ease the situation, either. Gentleness, humility and good listening skills will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
