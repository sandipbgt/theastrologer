    "horoscope": "Pay attention to your health today. Place balanced meals and exercise as a top priority. Quality sleep should be high on the list, too. When you take care of your body, it's easier for your mind to function at its peak. And you may have a lot on your to-do list, or a complex problem that needs to be reasoned through with care. Feed your body and you'll be feeding your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
