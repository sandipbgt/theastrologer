You're a logical person by nature, so just use your head when you're trying to determine whether something is really a good bet. If something doesn't add up, you'll know it. Your independence is highlighted now, and it feels great to know you can rely on yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
