Your romantic partner might be especially amorous, or especially irritable -- it could really go either way! The same goes for your friends and coworkers. And no, everyone hasn't lost their minds. Folks are just feeling more passionate today than usual. You can either avoid the hubbub, or get used to the blessedly short-lived dramatics.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
