    "horoscope": "It takes a lot of energy and drive to push toward a meaningful goal, especially when the going gets tough. It's a good thing, then, that you're even more focused and driven than usual. Today is perfect for following up on your brainstorms with substance. Don't forget the power of teamwork, either. Call in a favor and get someone's help in furthering your cause. Even if you have to work alone, though, you'll make solid progress.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
