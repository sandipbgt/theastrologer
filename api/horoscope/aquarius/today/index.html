If you're in conflict with someone you love, remember that there's a lot of common ground between you. You adore and respect this person, and you depend on them. Approach any problem from that perspective, and you're sure to find a resolution.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
