    "horoscope": "It has always been important to you to do what's best for everyone. You're very conscious of the needs of the group, whether that means your family, friends, coworkers or some other organization. And there's no better day than today to work in harmony with others. Everyone seems to be feeling the unified vibe. Togetherness flows easily, and cooperation is second nature. You can get a lot done with so much support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
