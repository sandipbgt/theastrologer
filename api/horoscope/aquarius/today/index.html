    "horoscope": "Right now you enjoy being part of a group. You feel a greater sense of belonging than usual, which makes any get-together that much more fun. And it's not as if your unique personality is being submerged. You're very much yourself, and others appreciate what you bring to the table. They're laughing at your jokes and stories. They appreciate the qualities that make you special, which makes you feel part of the team.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
