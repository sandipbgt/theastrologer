    "horoscope": "You're an activist at heart. You genuinely want to make the world a better place. But part of you wants recognition for your good deeds, and that part comes to the fore today. There's nothing wrong with wanting everyone to know about your contribution. But if you find yourself bragging to gain the spotlight, that's a good moment to take a step back. Recognition will come, at the right time. Trust in that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
