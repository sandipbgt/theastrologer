    "horoscope": "Your close connections with other people are delightfully harmonious today. There's a sense of easygoing togetherness uniting you. Any tensions that may have marred your relationship seem to just slide away. If you do have to talk out an issue with someone, the conversation should go well. Focus on your similarities instead of your differences, and look for ways to compromise. Finding that happy medium is what it's all about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
