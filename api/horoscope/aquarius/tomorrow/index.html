    "horoscope": "Empathy is highlighted today. You might benefit in some way from someone's compassion, or you may be in a position to extend warm consideration toward someone else. Emotional give and take can be an uncomfortable dynamic for you. You don't like feeling indebted to anyone, and you also don't like prying into others' personal business. But under the current influence, any acts of kindness will probably be more help than you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
