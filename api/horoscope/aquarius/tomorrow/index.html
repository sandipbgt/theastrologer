You have one interesting conversation after another, and every person you speak to inspires new creative ideas to pop up in your mind. If you're planning something -- a project, a party or anything else -- this is a great day for moving forward quickly toward your goal. But if you simply spend the day connecting with friends both new and old, that's good, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
