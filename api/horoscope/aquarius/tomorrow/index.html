They may not realize you're currently having a surge of inner strength, which enables you to move ahead in your work or an important relationship with seeming ease. This is a great time for connecting with as many people as you can. Contacts made now are sure to come into positive play later, so bring along your address book.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
