    "horoscope": "If you're in a sensitive, emotional mood today, you aren't alone. The current influence has stirred up lots of people's feelings. It's a good time to retreat from the world, if you can. Taking a nap, meditating or writing in your journal are all good ways to manage unruly emotions. Just don't make the mistake of trying to rationalize or ignore them. Bottling them up only makes them grow stronger.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
