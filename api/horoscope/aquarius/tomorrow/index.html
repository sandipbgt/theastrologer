This irritation may be real, but it's just as likely that it's all in your head. Either way, it's your job to manage it gracefully, because you can't just bite everyone's head off. Your focus now should be on kindness and cooperation. If you can fly solo today, even better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
