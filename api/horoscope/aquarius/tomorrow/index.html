That stubborn streak of yours is flaring up and you're finding fault with everyone around you. Especially the nay-sayers who seem to enjoy standing in your way! But try to be more generous in how you view people. Be more considerate in how you treat them. Let your natural social skill come out and play. Criticism and rigidity won't make you any friends, but flexibility and friendliness will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
