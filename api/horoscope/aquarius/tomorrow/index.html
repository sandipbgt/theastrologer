    "horoscope": "Welcome to your favorite kind of day. Your energy is strong and lighthearted all at once. You're able to focus, because your mind is attuned to life's interesting intellectual puzzles -- and yet, you're happy to set work aside in favor of social interactions. Really, being around other people is where it's at right now, whether you're having fun or getting something important accomplished. You revel in the company of your fellow humans.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
