    "horoscope": "Normally, you aren't driven by visions of fame or success. But today, part of you wants that public recognition. Is it so wrong to need props for your brilliance? Of course not! You deserve it, for all your good ideas and your hard work on behalf of others. Just don't push for that approval. Let it come naturally. And don't begrudge anyone else their own recognition and success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
