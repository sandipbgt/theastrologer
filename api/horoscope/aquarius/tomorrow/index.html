Good thing you can count on your intuition to fill in when you need it -- which may be often, since opportunities are coming your way quickly. Focus on the big picture, including the ingenious projects you design and implement yourself. You simply need to decide on one and begin it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
