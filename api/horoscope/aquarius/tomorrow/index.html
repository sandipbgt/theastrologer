    "horoscope": "To you, people are like interesting experiments. Their behavior and emotions seem so odd and unusual sometimes, as well as amusing -- that is, when they don't make you nervous. But while prying into the business of others may be therapeutic for you, it won't work for them. They might want your advice and support, but they don't want your criticism, or your meddling. Swallow those opinions today, because it's unlikely you'll convey them gracefully. And good will, after all, still counts for something. No matter what you're thinking, be friendly and nonjudgmental.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
