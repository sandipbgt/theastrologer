    "horoscope": "Today, others find you unreasonable. You want what you want when you want it, and it's no coincidence that your needs don't coincide with anyone else's. You're oblivious to people's efforts to shape or move you, which could cause some conflict at work or at home. Well, there is an upside: At least you're still an individual. Of course, if you annoy everyone you know, you'll also be on your own, which is only fun in the short term. Find the balance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
