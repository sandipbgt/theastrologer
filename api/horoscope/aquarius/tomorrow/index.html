When you take care of your body, it's easier for your mind to function at its peak. And you may have a lot on your to-do list, or a complex problem that needs to be reasoned through with care. Feed your body and you'll be feeding your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
