    "horoscope": "Suddenly, your mood may be cloudy. You aren't comfortable feeling this emotional. It's as if your heart itself is heavy,-logged with sentimental memories of the past and tricky, troublesome emotions. But maybe there's some part of your past or your emotional life that you need to face today. If you have unresolved feelings, face them now. If you keep bottling them up, you'll never release them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
