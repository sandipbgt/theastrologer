    "horoscope": "Personal freedom is a must today, intellectual freedom most of all. If you sense that some person or structure is limiting your ability to live, love or think freely, you'll probably get quite annoyed. You might even be tempted to toss out everything you've worked so hard to build and start fresh! That kind of total overhaul isn't necessary, though. Just find a way to remind yourself that freedom and independence are yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
