Facing your responsibilities brings you the best of both worlds -- you can tackle your duties as you like, enabling you to bring old business to a logical conclusion even as you stay strong in your convictions. Bravo! Save your best efforts for existing projects. You can focus on something new and exciting in a few days.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
