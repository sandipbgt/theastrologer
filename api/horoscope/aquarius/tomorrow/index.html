    "horoscope": "Someone's counting on you, but at the moment, you're being a little unreliable. Be aware of this issue and try to improve it today. Ignoring your affect on others would be ill-advised. You owe it to your friends, family members or work colleagues to show them you care about their needs and feelings. Don't sell yourself short, of course, because you're important. But you're not the only one who is.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
