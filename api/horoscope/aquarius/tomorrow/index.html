    "horoscope": "Outrageous ideas, acts and people seem wickedly delightful now. Your creativity is turned on by the idea that there really are no boundaries -- that the world is your oyster, and you can go anywhere you want and accomplish anything you set your mind to. As you go about your business, you might feel tempted to stir things up even further by getting in people's faces. This keeps life fun and interesting, right? Wrong! You're in a playful mood but you still need others' support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
