Sure, you're respecting your own boundaries and making sure no one takes advantage of you. But isn't it possible that it's all in your head -- that other people are simply going about their daily business, and you're the one that's all worked up about nothing? Try to bend today. You'll win your brownie points for the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
