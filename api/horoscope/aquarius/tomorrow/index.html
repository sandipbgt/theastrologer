    "horoscope": "Your emotions are up and down today, and it's hard to figure out what you're feeling. This could make you uncomfortable, if you let it -- or you could just go with the flow. Flexibility isn't your strong point, so challenge yourself to relax and follow where your heart leads you. If confusing images or ideas come to you, write them down. You can make more sense of them later, when your mind is clearer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
