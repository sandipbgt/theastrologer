Instead of hooking up with the wrong person or making a poor decision at work, cool down and be logical. Usually, logic is your strong point, because you've got a natural head for analysis. But now you may have to try extra-hard to see the situation clearly. That will help you figure out your next move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
