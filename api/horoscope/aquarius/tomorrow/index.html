    "horoscope": "It's a great day for launching a new project or re-envisioning an existing one. Your thoughts are invigorated, as if a fresh breeze has blown through your mind. You're seeing things in a new light, and you're interested in testing out novel perspectives or approaches. This open-minded, seeking quality is key to your own development. If you're working on something big, it may be key to others, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
