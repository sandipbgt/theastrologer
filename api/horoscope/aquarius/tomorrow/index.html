And if you're dancing to that different drummer, don't spin too far into your own private orbit. You shouldn't be wandering off the beaten path when combined energies can merge so easily into a greater whole. Hey, it could happen today. Even if it never happened before, there's always a first time. Just assume that now is the moment to manifest your best possible reality. There's no percentage in putting these things on hold, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
