    "horoscope": "You work hard on a regular basis, so balance that out with some fun today. Get together with friends. Enjoy some good food and better company. Great conversations spark from seemingly random comments or ideas. You'll love trading stories and comparing notes with others. Sharing ideas helps you hone your own, plus it's nice just to catch up with the people you care about most in the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
