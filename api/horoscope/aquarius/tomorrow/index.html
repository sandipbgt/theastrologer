    "horoscope": "Liberate yourself creatively. Who knows what you'll have to build or break to do that, but you'll figure it out. And once you do get yourself free, savor that freedom. It's not going to be a permanent state, because responsibility seems to be a big chunk of normal human adulthood. But don't kill this mood with too much deep thinking. For today, at least, nobody will own you or your time. And if someone disagrees with that, just let them try to hold you. There will be fireworks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
