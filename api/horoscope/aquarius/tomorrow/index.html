    "horoscope": "You're feeling on top of the world, and that's wonderful. It's great to enjoy yourself, and even take today to pat yourself on the back for all your hard work. But don't drop the ball or take your blessings for granted. Your allies are still important -- getting cocky and prematurely going solo would be a real mistake. You also still need to put some work into reaching your goals. Celebrate today, and then get back to work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
