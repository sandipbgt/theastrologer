    "horoscope": "You're fascinating, clever and innovative, and you know it. Now's your chance to prove it to other people. Use your creative problem-solving ideas and sparkling wit to show them you're so much more than just a pretty face or a laugh, although you can provide those, too. But you've got the smarts to back up your other good qualities, and there's no way they won't notice you today. You could even achieve a personal triumph, as long as you don't push anyone's buttons or the boundaries of good taste.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
