    "horoscope": "Normally you're fine with working behind the scenes; in fact, you prefer it. But today you crave recognition for your efforts, which means you'll have to bring your project out into the open, where other people can see it -- and critique it. This could make you uncomfortable. It's natural to feel a little on edge when you're revealing something so personal, especially something in which you've invested so much time, effort and hope.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
