    "horoscope": "Most people are feeling a bit sensitive today. For your part, you're feeling protective of what's yours, whether that's a project, an idea or a relationship.

You're just trying to safeguard the things you care about. But give everyone a little space.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
