    "horoscope": "You seem airy and wispy to rednecks and bodybuilders. But anyone really watching will see that your inner strength is huge. However, patience is one thing lacking from your unique mix of talents. Also, you could be a little pickier about what you take on. Read between the lines. Catch the right social cues. There's something much better a few blocks down the street. Prove that you can go deeper, grab more and use it better than those fools who think the world revolves around their brute strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
