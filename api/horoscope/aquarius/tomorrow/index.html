If you don't, you won't submit to them! But today's energy favors working within the rules. Boundaries are there for a reason. Sometimes they're to be crossed, or at least expanded. But now, it's best to respect their limits, and your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
