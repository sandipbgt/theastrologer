But being argumentative doesn't solve anything. Instead, try listening calmly to the other side. See if you can relate to their position. It's likely that there's some truth or validity to it. And if not, then you'll know what you're arguing against.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
