    "horoscope": "Suddenly, karma is serious business. You're aware now that the choices you make today could change everything, so be cautious and take a sober look at your immediate future. Better yet, why not spend the day doing research, talking to people and gathering more information and opinions? That way, you can make a more informed decision later, one you'll be sure is the right one. If you try to make a move prematurely, you'll just end up having to backtrack and correct your mistake.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
