    "horoscope": "You're feeling soft on the inside today, and perhaps even a bit emotionally vulnerable. This might make you nervous, but remember that it's also a highly creative state.

See if you can use your subjective perspective to fuel a project in some way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
