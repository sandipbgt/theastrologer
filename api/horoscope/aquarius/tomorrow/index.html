    "horoscope": "You want to help someone today. Counseling a friend or coworker may be a good way to put your mind to use and be of service to someone in need. You certainly have good advice to offer. Your perspective is both balanced and logical. Plus you're able to dream up creative, clever solutions to long-standing problems. There's a side benefit here, too -- offering assistance makes you feel better about yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
