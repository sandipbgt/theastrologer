    "horoscope": "You're in the mood to be around people today, especially those who challenge you intellectually. Tossing around ideas or funny stories feels like a mental workout in the best way. It's a wonderful day for lunch with coworkers or a long-distance call with an old friend. Board games and crossword puzzles are also fun and mentally stimulating. You might make yourself laugh with your own cleverness!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
