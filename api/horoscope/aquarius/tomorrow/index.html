There's a lot going on inside that brilliant mind of yours, and it shows when you speak as well as when you listen. Sometimes you're a bit of a loner, but not today. You're in the mood for company now, so chat with your coworkers in the break room, or gather with friends for dinner. Conversation and laughter do you good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
