    "horoscope": "You're capable today of great focus. This comes in handy whether you're at the office or at home. Any project you're working on benefits from careful, close attention. Do your best not to get caught up in minor details, however. Attention to detail is very important at the moment, but not when it impedes progress. Efficiency is important, too -- and economy of effort! After all, wasted time and energy can never be regained.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
