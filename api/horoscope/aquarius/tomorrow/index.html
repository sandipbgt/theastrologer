    "horoscope": "Oops, you did it again. You may feel tactless today. You'll have to go out of your way to cover your tracks. If you haven't actually said something you need to take back, good for you. Keep it that way. Censor yourself before others censure you. Let this touch of humility turn into another character-building moment. But don't humble yourself too much. The last thing you need now is an inferiority complex. After a certain point, you can't let other people's expectations rule you. Just start living up to your own, and that'll be enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
