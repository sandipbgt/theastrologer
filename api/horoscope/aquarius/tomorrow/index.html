    "horoscope": "Deep friendship comes naturally to you, though sometimes you're too much in your head to express your sentiments. Today, your warmth comes out, and your favorite people know exactly how dedicated you are. If the world seems a little cold and cruel, don't worry. Go ahead and put up your guard if you have to. Still, it would be better to give in to the strange, romantic energy and do away with being guarded altogether. Someone loves you a lot, and you can let them know you return the feeling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
