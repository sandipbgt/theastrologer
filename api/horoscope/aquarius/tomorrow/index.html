    "horoscope": "Fresh ideas take center stage today -- the more ingenious, the better. The current cosmic influence blends logic and creativity to great effect.

You know all about being innovative in your thinking but then subjecting your out-there ideas to rigorous logic. Disproving your own theories is part of the fun!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
