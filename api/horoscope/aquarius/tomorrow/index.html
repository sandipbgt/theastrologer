Since you tend to be a logical person, that may make you uncomfortable. But you know there's more to life than mere intellect. This is a great day to explore those subjective, emotional realms. Don't be afraid to lose yourself in feeling. You'll come back soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
