    "horoscope": "You're in your head today, chasing down experimental theories and unsubstantiated leads. The cerebral realm might bring you the most satisfaction, but don't forget to reconnect with the earthly plane, too, including friends and family. Check in with loved ones and let them know what you're working on. They might even have some good suggestions for where to take your project next.
