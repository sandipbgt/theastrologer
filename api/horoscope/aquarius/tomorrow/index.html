    "horoscope": "It's a good day to gather with old friends, or to make new ones. You're a bit of a loner at times, but now you should certainly be around other people. That's the best way to stimulate your creativity. And creativity is especially important now, since a new personal cycle begins for you today. It's time to look forward to the next month. Begin formulating an innovative plan or a blueprint for a new project.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
