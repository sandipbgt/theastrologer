    "horoscope": "You have plenty of ambition, but suddenly, climbing that career ladder just doesn't seem as important as making your own, independent decisions. You want to focus on what's right for you and yours. You'll even fight for it if you have to. Just remember, there's no need to get aggressive right off the bat. Usually, a calm, reasonable approach is the way to get people on your side. Pushing your agenda sensibly will gain you everyone's respect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
