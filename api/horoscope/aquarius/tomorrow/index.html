Your instincts might urge you to get creative, but that's not your best bet right now. Instead, it's time to focus. Get critical. Weigh out the pros and cons, or look for discrepancies in your logic. This might seem tedious, but it's necessary if you want to take the next solid step forward.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
