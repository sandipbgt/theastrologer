    "horoscope": "Spending time alone doesn't hold nearly as much appeal today as connecting with other people. Accept any invitations you receive, or host your own impromptu gathering. Conversation is stimulating and laughter flows easily now. It's a great day for a little romance, too! Spending time with a friend or someone special just feels right. It promotes a sense of togetherness, an awareness that we're all in this together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
