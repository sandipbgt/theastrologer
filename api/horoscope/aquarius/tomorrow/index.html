    "horoscope": "Today is a great day to push toward a certain goal. You're more focused and energetic than usual. You have the physical vigor needed to go for it, not to mention the mental sharpness. And your hide is tough. Any obstacles won't set you back in the least. Instead, you'll treat them as welcome challenges. You know you can find a clever way around them, or blast right through them. No problem!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
