You're focused on the future, and you're putting plans in place -- plans that are at once modern and rooted in tradition. This is your secret weapon today: using your innate creativity where it's appropriate, but relying on established structures when you need to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
