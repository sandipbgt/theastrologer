    "horoscope": "It's a great day to connect with someone you're close with -- a romantic partner, a business partner or just a close friend. The current energy lends itself to affectionate connections, which is especially welcome if you've experienced tension or distance with a loved one. Any gaps can be bridged today with relative ease. Since you truly appreciate the other person's influence in your life, you can make them feel appreciated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
