    "horoscope": "You may find yourself behaving in uncharacteristic ways today. Normally you're good at keeping your cool and taking a rational view of things. It takes a lot to get under your skin. But now your pride is easily pricked, and someone's careless comment could really hurt your feelings. Whether you respond dramatically or withdraw in wounded silence, understand that the slight was not intentional. The other person probably didn't realize how sensitive you were feeling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
