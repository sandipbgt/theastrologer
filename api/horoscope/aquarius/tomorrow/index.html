    "horoscope": "Everyone has their prejudices. No one is immune. In fact, today, even you might be shocked by your own words. Did that really come out of you? Do you actually think that way about certain people's lifestyle, politics or heritage? Well, a door into your closed mind just opened, even if that doesn't quite make you open-minded. Not yet, anyway. But you can try to be more tolerant, and you can change what you do with the information that comes in. Accept this challenge and meet it head on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
