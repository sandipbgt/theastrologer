But this is one of those days when it's important to take care of business, even if it's mind-numbingly tedious. So get those bills paid and in the mail, or return those phone calls and emails. The more logical and efficient you are, the sooner you'll finish this busy work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
