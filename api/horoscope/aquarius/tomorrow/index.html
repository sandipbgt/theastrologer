You might offer your perspective, especially since brainstorming is such a productive activity right now. But you won't push your ideas on anyone. You have genuine sense of respect for the process everyone must go through to educate themselves and arrive at their own conclusions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
