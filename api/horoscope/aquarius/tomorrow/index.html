    "horoscope": "You're naturally attracted toward all things contemporary and untested. Don't hunt or shop today for new stuff. Instead, your task is to make creative use of whatever you have on hand. You're so innovative, this should be easy and fun! Devise ways to put tools, coworkers, friends and other resources to use. Collaborate to complete something you've been working on for a while. Improvement starts at the ground level. Work your way up toward something full-fledged and incredible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
