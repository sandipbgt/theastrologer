    "horoscope": "Attending social or professional gatherings should be no problem today. In groups, you're in your element, talking and charming your way into people's good graces. It's a great day for networking, so if you have a personal cause or a project you'd like to launch, talk it up. You're quite eloquent now, and people are definitely listening up. Reason and passion combine to help you state your case convincingly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
