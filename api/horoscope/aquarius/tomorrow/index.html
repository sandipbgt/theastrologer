Solo efforts aren't nearly as effective now as cooperative ones. Combining your energies with those of other people can produce almost magical results. You can serve as the idea person whose vision guides the way for everyone. You've also got the follow-through to finish something you start.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
