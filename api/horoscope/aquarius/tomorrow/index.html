    "horoscope": "You're full of humanitarian urges today, and they're sure to gain you extra good karma. Fate certainly seems to be on your side, but don't forget that good behavior still counts, too. Work within the lines, not outside them -- take the proper avenues to gain the support you need. Clear things with your boss, draw up a proposal, and submit it through official channels. You'll be glad you took the legitimate route later, when things get more complicated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
