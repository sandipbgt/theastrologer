    "horoscope": "Many people are expressing themselves in rather intense, emotional ways today. And you probably aren't comfortable with this. They seem overly dramatic. Why can't they just calm down? Alternatively, you may have an emotional outburst of your own, which might be highly out of character. In either situation, the key is to avoid overreacting or judging anyone harshly. Life gets tricky sometimes. This might just be one of those days.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
