    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised when everyone around you oohs and ahhs over your latest project. Your work is original and your intentions are aboveboard. Expect high marks from your employer, professor, coworkers and associates alike. In general, praise and compensation will flow easily in your direction today, so take advantage of this brief yet beneficial period. Your best bet is to draw together a fine team and work together toward a common goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
