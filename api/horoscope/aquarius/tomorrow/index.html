There's a lot of power and creativity in group efforts, and you can tap into that now even more easily than usual. Gather your colleagues to brainstorm ideas for a new project, and watch the magic start to happen. If you're at home, gather friends or family to come up with creative ways of doing mundane things like cleaning house or making dinner.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
