    "horoscope": "Passion gets physical, and it's about time, too. Far-out ideas come closer towhere you can reach them. Today will be so comfortable that you'll feel like you were born wearing it. Your brilliance and talent will be all over the landscape. Friends will look at you with that special light in their eyes. Strangers will know about your good works. But just as you start setting up shop, the wind of popular demand will shift. Why can't it stay this way? Don't get so attached, and you could have these moments of glory all the time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
