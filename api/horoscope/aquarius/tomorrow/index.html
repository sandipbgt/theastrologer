    "horoscope": "Yes, you're brilliant. No, you won't outshine others, because you need them on your side. However beautifully you might express yourself, your brilliance would be so much less without their backup. They're probably thinking similar thoughts about you, too. Never mind who's better than whom. Just show absolute mutual respect today. Willing partners can make themselves very useful to each other, without ever breathing a word about sacrifice or dignity. Look totally cool and unified to outsiders. That'll be the real upside to this arrangement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
