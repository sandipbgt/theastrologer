Talking with them, especially about big ideas and plans, is very satisfying now, and people really appreciate your kindness and openness. When someone has a particularly unique viewpoint, let them know they've hit on something. You can inspire many people today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
