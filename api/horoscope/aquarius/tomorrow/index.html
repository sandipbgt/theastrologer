That means spending your money carefully, or better yet, saving it. That also means budgeting your time wisely. Don't waste time chasing down false leads or tilting at windmills, so to speak. Base your thinking and your operations firmly in the here and now. Go with what works.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
