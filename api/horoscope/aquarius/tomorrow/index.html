    "horoscope": "You're in an unusual mood, aren't you? Pepped up, zingy -- maybe even a little romantic. You know how to charm both your admirers and your admire-ees. But making people laugh isn't enough, even if you bring every ounce of your creativity to your stories -- and even if you enjoy being center stage, for once. Don't you want to go a little deeper than that? Pursue a real connection, whether it's a romantic connection or just an intimate bond with someone you deeply love. Don't stay surface-level - you'll shortchange yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
