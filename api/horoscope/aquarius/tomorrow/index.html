    "horoscope": "You're swept along by a brisk breeze in your sails today, which carries you forward without a lot of effort on your part. Someone has to man the helm, of course, but the current is definitely in your favor. With this frisky, can-do energy at your disposal, you'll be motivated to move projects along as much as you can. Take advantage of this celestial fair wind and cover a lot of ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
