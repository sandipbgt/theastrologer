    "horoscope": "Maybe you have a couple of secrets that are slowly, sweetly ripening. Maybe a private flash of insight is putting that grin on your face. Maybe the scope of a project just ballooned, driving your future profits into the stratosphere. Whatever's going on inside your head, keep it under your hat for today. Live your life, greet your neighbors, hang with your friends. They'll know something is ready to pop, but your carefree attitude will drive them crazy. You like having your audience on the edge of their seats. Nothing is more powerful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
