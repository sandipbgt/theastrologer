    "horoscope": "Today's warm, loving energy puts you in touch with your sincere side. You really want to do some good for someone, and you're willing to put in honest effort toward that end. Of course, you've always been a humanitarian, so this isn't a huge stretch for you. But maybe you've been a little complacent lately, thinking you're doing enough and there's no room for improvement. Which, of course, there always is! Best of all, making someone else feel like a million bucks, or even just making them smile, feels equally good to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
