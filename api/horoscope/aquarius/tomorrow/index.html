High standards are the norm right now. You might think you can't possibly live up to such unreasonable expectations, and you may be right. But stretch yourself a little. Treat it as a challenge. You might find you have greater capabilities than you realized.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
