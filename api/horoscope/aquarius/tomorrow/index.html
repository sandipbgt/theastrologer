You're equal to any situation that might arise at work or at home, because you've learned so much about so many different things. Knowing at least a little about a lot helps when unexpected circumstances come into play. You can think on your feet, impressing everyone -- including yourself. Enjoy being creative and dynamic as you meet the demands of your day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
