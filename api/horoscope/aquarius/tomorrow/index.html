    "horoscope": "Your scientific mind will come in handy today as you work slowly and carefully on a project that's meaningful to you. Don't scrimp on details, and take an analytical approach to making future plans. You love thinking outside the box, but wild speculation won't fly today. You need to work within the established rules. Do your research, and make sure that any modifications you make are carefully grounded in reality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
