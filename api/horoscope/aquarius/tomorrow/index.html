    "horoscope": "You're in a good mood. You're feeling strong and centered from the inside out. Today can't make a dent in your high spirits. Take this chance to laugh at your own ego -- a simple solution to the universal problem of taking ourselves too seriously. We forget that life is a brief, sweet, humorous game. Remember it now, though, and remind others. Your cheerful humility will help you make new friends, which can only help your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
