As long as you're spending time with other people, you're good. Intellectually stimulating conversations abound. A simple chat could spark a creative idea that excites you immeasurably. You might even meet someone you'd like to work with on a particular project.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
