    "horoscope": "Today, your abilities are tested. This shouldn't make you nervous, since you know you're intelligent. You also know you're capable of real focus and effort. Now you just have to demonstrate this to your employer, client or anyone else who is relying on you. It shouldn't be difficult. Your concentration is at an all-time high. Just stay focused on your end goal and you'll be fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
