    "horoscope": "Your open-mindedness is one of your best qualities, and it's highlighted today. You approach every project and idea in a spirit of inquiry. You don't assume you know anything concrete about, well, anything. Everything is open to experimentation and exploration. What fun! And what a great way to view the world -- especially on a day like this, when truth can shift like sands in the wind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
