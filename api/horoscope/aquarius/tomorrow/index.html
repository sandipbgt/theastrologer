    "horoscope": "Let yourself lie low today, if you can. Your usual energy may be somewhat depleted. It's a good idea to sleep in, or get to bed early. This has the added benefit of allowing you to spend more time in dreamland. You might notice that your visions, including daydreams during waking hours, are much more vivid than usual! Use these as a source of inspiration for your next project.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
