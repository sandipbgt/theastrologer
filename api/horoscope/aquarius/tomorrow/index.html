You'll need to draw on all your tact and patience when dealing with other today - -- which could feel like a real feat, because you're mighty irritable at the moment. Here's a hint: Bad behavior won't get you what you want. Being polite and courteous will. Vigorous exercise will work out some of those kinks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
