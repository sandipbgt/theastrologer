    "horoscope": "The people around you might wonder today whether there's a method to your madness. You're making finicky choices and exhibiting erratic behavior, and everyone's a little nervous. A little more focus from you would help increase others' confidence in you as well as actually help you get somewhere practical. Don't be surprised if, once you do find that focus, you realize you were moving in the wrong direction. Now that you've self-corrected, this is no longer a problem.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
