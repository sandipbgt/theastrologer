So take this opportunity for what it's worth, and make sure you're persistent with your message. You'll probably be both surprised and pleased to find that open-minded people are already on your side, but more conservative types may need some convincing. That's okay -- you're creative and charming enough to bring anybody around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
