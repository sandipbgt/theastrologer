And here's the real point: Why miss out on all the fun? Instead of brooding over something that's in the past, look for something to smile about. Odds are, there are a lot of wonderful people and experiences just waiting for you to appreciate them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
