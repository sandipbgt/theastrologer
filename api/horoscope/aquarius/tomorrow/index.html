    "horoscope": "A peaceful, affectionate mood sets in today. You'll do whatever it takes to enjoy the time you spend with other people, whether that's friends, family or professional associates. Harmony is especially important to you now. For that reason, it's a very good time to reconnect with someone if your relationship has been strained or distanced. You're more likely to go out of your way to maintain that bond.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
