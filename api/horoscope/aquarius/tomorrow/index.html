    "horoscope": "If the world looks bleak, you just aren't looking closely enough. Something peculiar is beckoning from an unexpected corner. Shake off your melancholy and find out what it is. If you do, unexpected happiness could end up rocking your world -- but only if you let it. If you keep pouting and licking your wounds, it'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy: Nothing special will come your way, and life will keep plodding along in a depressingly familiar way. Get creative and step outside this funk.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
