    "horoscope": "It's your turn to lead the dance. All eyes are on you, and you're pulling things together out of your imagination. Today you'll be extremely attuned to your own style. You're moving and flowing, and you're doing it so smoothly, with such ease, that no one could possibly know how carefully you orchestrated those moves. Keep on dancing. You can rest later. For now, keep your energy up and your eyes open.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
