    "horoscope": "When you're used to thinking outside the box, days like today can be frustrating. Stay inside the lines now. Following the rules, doing what's expected of you -- oh, could life get any more tedious? But try not to look at it that way. View this instead as a good opportunity to take care of business on a small scale. Attend to mundane details then you can return to more interesting topics.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
