    "horoscope": "The future beckons. Somehow you're above the fray today, along with your intellectual, charming friends. You're feeling creative and you want to put your collective effort to good use. At the center of your efforts is the idea of individual liberty and justice for all. Freedom is always an important principle to you, as is friendship. The future is a group effort, after all, so busy yourself making it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
