    "horoscope": "You're hard to govern, and the problem is only getting bigger. You're more than an unruly child or agitator. You're actually developing your own ideas about taking over. You might turn into a revolutionary tyrant if you're not careful. And history is clear about how people like that eventually end up. What a waste. And so painful, too. Try using this vast energy positively today. Try rebuilding the system instead of sweeping it away. If you want to reach for utopia, you'll need to be standing on something solid.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
