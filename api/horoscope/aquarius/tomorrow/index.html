    "horoscope": "Though you can be a bit of a loner at times, this is no time to go it alone. You're in the mood to gather with friends or work closely in tandem with your coworkers. Like-minded people brighten your day. It feels good to fight for the same cause. It boosts your confidence, and brings you new ideas and approaches you may not have considered on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
