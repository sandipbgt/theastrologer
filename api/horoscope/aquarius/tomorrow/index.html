    "horoscope": "Don't be so independent-minded today that you turn down all the party invitations you receive. Your natural interest in your fellow humans will be satisfied by all the interesting people you'll meet at those gatherings you're thinking of boycotting. Get with the program and be sociable. You're very good at it when you give yourself a chance. And the connections you make today will be important in the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
