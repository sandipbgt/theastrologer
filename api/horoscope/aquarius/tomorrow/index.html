It's OK to deviate from the pattern, no matter what the poll numbers or focus groups are saying. Most people only know what they can see, and they see where they're told to look. But your sharp eyes are all over the place. And right now the coolest opportunities are far off the beaten path. You'll know them when you get there, unless you find something even cooler first.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
