Yes, you like people, but today you'll prove just how far you'll go for them, as your humanitarian streak burns brighter than ever. You'll see opportunities that others won't, and your job may be as subtle as giving out hints or as obvious as shoving the totally clueless in the right direction. One way or another, you'll work it out so that everyone gets their share. Oh, and don't worry about getting your share. Your bonus is already built into this deal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
