    "horoscope": "Today is a good day for delving into your past. This might happen at home, sitting around the dinner table, swapping stories with your loved ones. Or perhaps you'll want to discuss old issues in a more formal way with your counselor, or write about them in your journal. It's important to process feelings and memories, especially the tough ones -- or the sweet ones you're having a hard time letting go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
