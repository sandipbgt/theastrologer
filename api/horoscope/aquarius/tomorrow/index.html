But today, you're feeling a little nervous. Sticking with the status quo might seem like your safest option. But you don't want to look like an old fogy, do you? This is no time to box yourself in. Embrace whatever is making you feel so uncomfortable. Then you'll feel more secure in this unpredictable world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
