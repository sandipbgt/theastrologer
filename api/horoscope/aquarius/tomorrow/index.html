    "horoscope": "Many people are relaxed today. With luck, you'll tap into that mellow influence, too. But if you're working or interacting with other people, arguments are possible now. Try to listen well and be cooperative, even if you believe you have a better idea. Focus on the bottom line: the most straightforward and practical way to do something. Simplify your life. Go back to basics, in any way that applies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
