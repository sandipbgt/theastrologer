More to the point, are you sure you're starting an important movement and not just instigating trouble? Because today, it might be hard to tell the difference. For that reason, do only what's necessary. If, in a few days, you still believe some part of your life is in need of radical change, then you can set about making that happen. But not right now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
