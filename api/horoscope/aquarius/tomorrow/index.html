It's good to tie up any loose ends, especially if you're in the final stages of a project. But do try to remember the phrase 'Don't sweat the small stuff.' If some point isn't working, set it aside. Move on to larger issues. The big picture is important, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
