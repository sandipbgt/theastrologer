    "horoscope": "The current influence greatly enhances your imagination. If you're a creative type, this is a good thing. You'll produce wonderfully fantastical works of art! But it's considerably harder now to focus on mundane tasks, or ones that rely on strict logic. Crunching numbers or filing papers, for example, might make you impossibly tired. It's a good day for a nap, so take one if you can work it into your schedule.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
