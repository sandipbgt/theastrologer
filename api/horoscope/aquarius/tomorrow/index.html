    "horoscope": "Expect a rush of emotion at some point today. You aren't used to being a sappy, gooey type. But people and events have a way of getting in past your defenses today, affecting you at a deeply subjective level. When this happens, just go with it. There's no sense in pretending to be stoic or ignoring your feelings. You could make a really nice, personal connection with someone if you stay open and emotional.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
