    "horoscope": "Clear communication will be paramount to wrapping up your work. Make your agenda explicit to everyone involved today. Otherwise, you could run into one embarrassing tactical error after another, which wouldn't look good to your boss or client. Avoid those problems by being specific about what you hope to achieve. Don't set your expectations too high, either. This day is far better for making modest progress on an existing project than it is for launching something new and splashy. Maybe you'll appreciate the current energy's low-key quality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
