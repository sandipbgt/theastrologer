    "horoscope": "If you're feeling dreamy today, go ahead and let your mind wander. Trying to rein in your thoughts would be like trying to contain the fog -- impossible! But you're in an incredibly imaginative state of mind right now, so if you have a creative job or hobby, your work could receive a real boost. Pay extra attention to your dreams as well as the thoughts that occur in quiet moments.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
