    "horoscope": "Like many people, your opinions are strong today, because they're deeply rooted in your feelings. And feelings aren't subject to logic. Thus, you might take a strong stance that's purely emotional in nature. In that state of mind, it's hard to listen to reason. You might close yourself off to it, in fact. But try not to cling so stubbornly to your own point of view. Stay open to self-discovery.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
