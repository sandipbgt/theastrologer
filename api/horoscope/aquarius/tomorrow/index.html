Do your research and analyze the components of the issue, so you can make an educated guess about the outcome. Then go into the testing phase. Mind you, this isn't random experimentation. It's very important now to be strict in your methods. Use that sharp mind of yours and you'll be fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
