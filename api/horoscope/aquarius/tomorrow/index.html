    "horoscope": "When it comes to your personal connections, you're pretty low-maintenance: You know who you love and who has your devotion. You don't need a lot of demonstrative frills to underscore that connection. But today, it's better to be a little more overt in your affections. Someone you adore may be wondering if your bond is really as strong as they thought. Reassure them, even if you think you shouldn't have to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
