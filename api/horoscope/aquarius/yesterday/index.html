    "horoscope": "Welcome to a fun day. Ideas and activities develop at the spur of the moment. This keeps you guessing all day! And you wouldn't have it any other way. You love an unplanned day. Furthermore, your independent nature is highlighted now. You crave freedom and action. Make sure you have plenty of autonomy, so you can do what you want. Being held back by rules, restrictions or expectations would just irritate you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
