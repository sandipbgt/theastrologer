    "horoscope": "A sweet and rapturous mood is yours for the taking, if you'll embrace it. And if you do, you can spend the day in your own private utopia of thrilling fantasies about what the future will bring. This will be useful for your private life as well as for your future career, but don't sell or preach to bring other people on board -- not just yet, anyway. You're still in the planning stages, which should happen inside your own mind. However you spend the day, savor the benefits in solitary bliss.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
