    "horoscope": "Your brilliance and creativity shine today. You're impressing your admirers, in part because you're trying to dazzle someone you, yourself, admire. Still, don't forget your radical nature, or the way you need to be true to yourself. You love debunking myths and surprising people, and you'll never be one to hide your unique qualities for the sake of getting along. That's just how you are. So if any of this blows back in your face, it shouldn't be a huge surprise. That's part of living on the edge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
