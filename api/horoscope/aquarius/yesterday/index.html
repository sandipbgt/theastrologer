    "horoscope": "You tend to shy away from emotional confrontations, or people who seem a little too clingy. But today, try to recognize others' behavior for what it is. Someone might seem as if they're creating drama, but really, they just want what everyone wants -- closeness, affection and appreciation. If there's any tension in one of your close relationships, try warming up a little instead of pulling away. Odds are good that this will solve the problem.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
