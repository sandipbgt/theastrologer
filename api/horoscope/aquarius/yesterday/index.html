    "horoscope": "Stirring things up is one of your special talents, not to mention one of your favorite pastimes. You love the social experiment of throwing a wrench into things and seeing how people handle it. And right now, you're not in the mood to discuss any plans. You just want to act. But relations are already strained -- how will it help to behave so recklessly? Try to stay calm and cooperative instead. You'll gain karmic brownie points if you can quell your passion for rebellion and be a helpful force instead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
