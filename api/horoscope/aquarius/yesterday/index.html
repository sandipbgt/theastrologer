    "horoscope": "Your sensitive side is prominent today. You might find that your feelings are easily hurt by comments you wouldn't normally notice, much less take personally. Surprise, surprise -- you have buttons that can be pressed, after all! Of course, your friends and family know you have a vulnerable side. It just might not show itself except on days like today, when a very particular cosmic influence is in effect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
