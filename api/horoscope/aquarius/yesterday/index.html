    "horoscope": "You may be uncomfortable in the spotlight, but today you'll probably find yourself there regardless. If so, why not make the most of it? If you have everyone's attention, you can use it to promote an important cause or to make everyone aware of something that's meaningful to you. Being the center of attention doesn't have to mean you're being smug or arrogant. It's all in how you present yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
