These kinds of endeavors could really take off now, provided you hook up with the right group. The good news is, you have excellent taste, in both projects and people. It should be easy enough to shrug off anything that's not perfect, freeing you up to pursue what you want to experience or achieve. So go to it, and make it count.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
