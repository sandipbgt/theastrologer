    "horoscope": "Your usual independence is submerged today beneath an urge to be surrounded by familiar, beloved faces. Or perhaps you're still in the mood to fly solo, but a friend or family member is leaning on you for comfort. Do your best to be there for them, even if you wish you could have some peace and quiet. You rely on your loved ones, too -- now more than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
