That might be losing yourself in work or research, or going for a long walk in nature. Your best bet today is not to over-think your feelings. Just feel them, and let them wash through you like a river. Things will seem a lot better and brighter very, very soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
