    "horoscope": "Thoughts and impressions blend today. Normally, a highly emotional day might fray your nerves, but that shouldn't be an issue now. Instead, being this in touch with your feelings brings a sense of inner calm. Sometimes it's nice to match up your ideas with their more subjective counterparts. It lets you know why you think the way you do. And this is a creative breeding ground for truly innovative theories and plans.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
