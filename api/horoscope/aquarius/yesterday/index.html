    "horoscope": "Emotional encounters with other people seem more like unwelcome entanglements today. Or maybe you're facing your own inner demons in some way, and getting all mixed up over them. Either way, resist the urge to retreat! Emotional experiences only intensify if you try to bottle them up or ignore them. The sooner you acknowledge them, the sooner you can resolve them. Then you'll be free of them forever.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
