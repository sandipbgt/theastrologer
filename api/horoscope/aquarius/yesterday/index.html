    "horoscope": "You're quite the social butterfly today, so if you've received any party invitations for tonight, don't turn them down, even if you have to work tomorrow morning. Everyone's spirits are running high. The people you meet will be fascinating at the very least, and could actually become good friends. Make an effort to be tolerant. Start a conversation with someone you wouldn't ordinarily talk to. Reach out to a whole new world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
