Or, the issue may be within you, and your friend has no idea that you're feeling awkward. Either way, your impulse is to keep your feelings hidden, but it would be better to bring them to light. You'll find things aren't as bad as you thought.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
