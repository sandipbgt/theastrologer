    "horoscope": "A selfless mood sets in. You can sense others' needs and weak spots, and you want to jump in and help them in any way you can. You're more naturally practical and self-protective than some people, and that's a good thing. It reduces the chances that you'll fall for someone's sob story or allow anyone to take advantage of your compassion. That clears the way for genuine healing through sharing life's burdens.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
