    "horoscope": "You feel a particular appreciation today for anything artistic. You're drawn to creative expression of reality -- what it's like to be human, here on earth, described in emotional terms. This is a good day to broaden your mind to absorb fanciful concepts, even if doing so leaves you feeling confused. It's just a foggy kind of day, but feeling your way through the fog can actually be quite illuminating.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
