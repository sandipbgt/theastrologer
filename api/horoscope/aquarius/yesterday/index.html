Of course you should enjoy yourself and take pleasure in the company of your many friends. But you have a chance now to start the ball rolling on some endeavor that's very close to your heart. If you play it right, you can socialize with friends new and old, while drawing future allies your way -- people who can help you further your cause when the time comes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
