    "horoscope": "Your independent streak is broad today. You want to do things in your own way, at your own pace -- which is likely to be a fast one! That's part of the reason why you want to go solo now: Hardly anyone can keep up with you as you blaze through your work and other activities. They'll probably watch you in action, though, and enjoy the blur of motion you create.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
