What's wrong with simply saying what you're thinking and feeling? If that seems overly selfish or just out of line, push yourself to compromise. Giving a little in order to gain a little won't be that bad, and it's certainly preferable to out-and-out rebellion, which just isn't likely to work in your favor today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
