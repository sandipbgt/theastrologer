    "horoscope": "An aloof, unemotional mood descends today. You may have a lot on your mind, especially if you have a long to-do list or a packed schedule. It's good to get in the mindset of work and responsibilities, but you can also take this a little too far. If a friend or family member needs you, for example, do your best to make time for them. They're on your list of responsibilities, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
