    "horoscope": "No matter your age, you're young in spirit today, and your heart is attuned to the siren song of freedom. You don't want to follow anyone's lead but your own. A cheerfully rebellious energy has infused your soul. Zany, electric vibes follow wherever you go. Your only job now is to follow your muse wherever she may lead --  and as long as you're at least a little bit careful, everything will be fine. Fun should be your top priority, but a close second priority is making sure that you don't get hurt.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
