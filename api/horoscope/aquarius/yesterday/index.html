If it's not your idea, you could probably make a few pointed suggestions. So do you have a useful perspective on all this? If you're either mulishly invested or miles removed, that answer would be no. Today requires a more moderate stance. Go with the flow, not against it. Even if it takes you someplace strange, you could fit right in. You won't know until you get there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
