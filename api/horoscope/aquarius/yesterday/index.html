    "horoscope": "Today you're tasked with maintaining the balance in your personal relationships. This should be easy for you, since you naturally have a strong sense of equity in your connections. You wouldn't want to be in a relationship, whether personal or professional, that was based on a sense of obligation! You're much more comfortable with bonds that are based on a mutual sense of interest and respect. Build those foundations today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
