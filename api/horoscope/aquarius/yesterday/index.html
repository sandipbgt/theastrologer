    "horoscope": "Enthusiasm is great, up to a point. Are you annoying people with all that cheerleading and sales talk? Don't be so pushy. It won't do a lot for your business, and it could harm you socially. If you want some real action, start a different kind of forward movement today. There has to be a better way of reaching out to friends, neighbors and random strangers on the street. Don't incite them. Invite them. Make it worth their while with some kind of tangible payoff up front. If you feed them, they will come.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
