Work alone, if you can. That way, you can muddle through at your own pace, make your own mistakes -- and clean them up before anyone sees. If you absolutely have to work on a team, be as patient and respectful as possible. Make it a collaborative effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
