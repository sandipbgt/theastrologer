    "horoscope": "A feeling of abundance makes you incredibly generous with others today. You feel optimistic and self-assured, and you want everyone around you to share the faith. Talking with them, especially about big ideas and plans, is very satisfying now, and people really appreciate your kindness and openness. When someone has a particularly unique viewpoint, let them know they've hit on something. You can inspire many people today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
