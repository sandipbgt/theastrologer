    "horoscope": "Today you're motivated to accomplish something big -- something bold -- something that requires a lot of courage and grit. This is the sort of energy that pushes you to climb a mountain or bungee-jump off a cliff. You're suddenly aware that your abilities aren't nearly as limited as you might have thought. Use this in whatever you're trying to achieve, even if it isn't as flashy as a test of your physical prowess!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
