    "horoscope": "You may feel a little spaced out today. Your energy is low and your thoughts wander easily. This is a pleasant state of mind, as long as you don't push yourself to concentrate when focus is elusive. If you can set aside detailed work and heavy responsibilities, it's much more natural under the current cosmic influence to put your energy into your personal relationships. Or, center yourself by reading, writing or napping.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
