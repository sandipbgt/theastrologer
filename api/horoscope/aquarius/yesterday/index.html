    "horoscope": "You're powerful and self-reliant, and you definitely have a clear goal in mind. You know what you want, and it's likely that you know how to get there, too. And yet, you're still able to serve other people's needs, too. Hmm -- is this a master plan in the works? It must be. Don't be sidetracked if you're working on earning brownie points for the future. Assisting others is a great way to secure their support when you need it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
