    "horoscope": "Suddenly, you're feeling strange, uneasy energy bubbling away, and you know it's time for a change. But does that really mean you have to throw out all of your old ways? After all, this may not be an entirely sincere gesture on your part. You might just be trying to stir people up. That's one of your favorite pastimes, Aquarius -- making people think, jostling them out of their mundane ways of thinking. But don't be surprised if all you stir up today is chaos.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
