    "horoscope": "If all else fails, make a joke. There's something universal about appropriate humor -- the key word here being 'appropriate.' Do what you can to lighten any atmosphere that seems overly somber. You have a talent for finding the humor in any situation, and let's face it, a good laugh relieves a lot of tension. So if you can draw out a smile from anyone else, you're doing well. It's some good medicine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
