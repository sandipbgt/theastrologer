    "horoscope": "You've always been thoughtful and analytical., but today that cerebral tendency is in overdrive. Suddenly, you're a hairsplitting perfectionist, and it's making everyone uneasy, starting with you. If you know you won't get your way, it might be better to go it alone for the day. Keeping to yourself will be easier on everyone, and it will give you a chance to attend to your own health and well-being. Besides, pursuing your own ideas and projects in private allows you to hone them before you put them out in public view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
