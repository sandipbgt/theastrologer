    "horoscope": "Grumbling, overreacting and stirring up trouble will be your M.O. today. Cooperation becomes difficult as that stubborn streak of yours intensifies, making everyone feel uncomfortable. The question is, do you know what you want, or are you just rebelling? The latter is likely. You want to get people worked up, since you're feeling uneasy yourself. But a better approach would be to take a few deep breaths and remind yourself to stay on track. Rocking the boat for no good reason can only lead to a mess you'll have to clean up later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
