    "horoscope": "Relationships can bring substantial risk. As soon as you let down your defenses, all kinds of things can get in. But do you want to live in a vacuum? If not, be more approachable today. Make sure you're not working at cross-purposes with somebody who wants what's best for you. Even when your intentions are golden, one little slip could look really bad. Do your best, and if you screw up, at least you can say you tried. You'll have other chances to be perfect, especially if you find someone more sympathetic to your flaws.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
