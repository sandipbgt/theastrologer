    "horoscope": "Now more than ever, you prefer smooth interactions with your friends, coworkers and strangers alike. Usually, you're okay with a little rocking the boat. Differences of opinion, after all, are what give life its zesty flavor. But for now, you're into easy connections, not challenging ones. If there are any surprises today, you want to be the one to spring them. Just don't be surprised if others don't agree. You're not the one who makes the rules, you know. Someone might make waves just to put you in your place!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
