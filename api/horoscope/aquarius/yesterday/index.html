There's a feeling in thethat everyone wants to get along, but group accord is more easily wished for than achieved. You can step in with a level head if any disagreement arises. You possess both creativity and charisma, and people want to follow your lead. You're able to make them feel as if it's an equal team effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
