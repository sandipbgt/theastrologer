    "horoscope": "Today could be an emotionally intense day. The key is to stay open to developing greater self-awareness, even if that happens through a tense experience, such as an argument with a friend. It's also a good time for a heart-to-heart talk, as long as you're completely honest -- while still being kind, of course. These kinds of emotional confrontations may be uncomfortable for you, but they're important. They help you grow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
