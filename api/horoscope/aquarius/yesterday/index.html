    "horoscope": "You're usually quite logical and analytical, but now your head is working with your heart, and your instincts are humming. Whether by intuition or by prophecy, you know what's coming today. This is good because now you're free to act on your hunches. Following your gut will take you in the right direction. Be sure to connect with friends now, and accept their support if they offer it. They genuinely want to help, and you'll accomplish more working as a team than on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
