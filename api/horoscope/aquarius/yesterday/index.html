    "horoscope": "Okay, your friends and family know you can be stubborn. But today, you're beyond resistant. In fact, to put it plainly, you're downright ornery, and anyone who gets in your way had better watch out, or you'll treat them to a tongue-lashing. Hmm, maybe that's not the best way to operate, even if you are in a foul mood. Instead of hurting people's feelings or burning bridges, back off before somebody else gets hurt. Be kind to yourself, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
