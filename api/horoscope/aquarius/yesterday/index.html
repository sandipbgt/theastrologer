    "horoscope": "Life could seem a little slow-paced today. A sad mood could even set in, but if it does, know that it will be fleeting. Your humanitarian streak is prominent today. You feel others' pain as if it were your own, and you want to do something to help them. It's a good thing you're savvy enough to focus on people who want to help themselves. That way, you know your efforts aren't in vain.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
