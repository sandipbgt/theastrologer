    "horoscope": "Everyone seems to be vying for the spotlight except you. You aren't interested in competing for others' attention. In your view, either they're intrigued by what you're doing, or they aren't, and you aren't willing to court their curiosity. But warming up just a little could really help your cause. Sometimes people need to know you care whether or not they're involved in your life. And you could certainly use their support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
