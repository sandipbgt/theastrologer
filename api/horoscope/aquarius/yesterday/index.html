    "horoscope": "Success-oriented types might change friends and outfits frequently, but while you're certainly ambitious, you don't want to be that flighty. How much do you value your relationships? The answer is probably more than you realize, because despite your lifelong need for independence, you're deeply committed to the people you care about. Take a few days to savor your connections with friends, family, and even coworkers and clients -- the people in your life who mean the most to you. Be grateful you're not one to throw away a meaningful bond just to get ahead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
