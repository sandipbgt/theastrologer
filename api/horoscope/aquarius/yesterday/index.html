    "horoscope": "Your energy comes in steadily today, enabling you to stick to whatever you're doing as long as it takes to get it done. If you're working, you might even forget to come up for air. That's how thorough you are now! And being thorough is a smart idea. It shows you're dedicated to your responsibilities. Showing someone important how dependable you are is sure to make a good impression.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
