And thanks to that light, you're seeing farther than usual, discovering things you never knew existed, and getting intense around new ideas. Good on you for reaching this illuminated state. And if those ideas are really good, they can wait another day. Stay focused on the now. You have business here, remember? Don't ditch the people who will suffer if you leave in the middle of things. And don't try to run with loose ends whipping madly around your ankles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
