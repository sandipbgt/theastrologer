Now you can find out the reasons behind the tension -- but only if you're open to that knowledge. The current influence really lends itself to developing greater awareness of yourself or of someone you're close to, but it requires a generous, nonjudgmental perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
