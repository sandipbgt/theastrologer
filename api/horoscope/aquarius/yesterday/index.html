    "horoscope": "Today, your energy and spunk will take you lots of interesting places, and they're sure to get you out of any tight spots you might get into. You're bolder than usual, which means you're more willing to take risks in your work, conversations and so on. And everyone knows that taking risks can mean making mistakes! But no matter. You'll dance away from trouble and blast through challenges like a pro.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
