    "horoscope": "You're feeling a little blue today, aren't you? And home may not be much of a refuge. If you're having trouble with a loved one, it may be best just to let it rest for a while. A long walk, or a nice, long nap, might help. Whatever you do, focus on taking care of yourself. Running yourself ragged or stressing out will only make the situation worse, but a little self-care could usher in a calm, new perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
