    "horoscope": "It's as if someone cleared the cobwebs out of your mind, or maybe they just pulled aside a curtain, revealing life's glittering truths. Whatever's changed inside you, you're having one insight after another, and they're spot-on. Now is not the time to keep your newfound wisdom to yourself, either. Share it with the people around you. They could really use the help. And in return, you'll enjoy making a difference in their lives. Rest assured, the favor will be repaid somewhere down the line, when you need it most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
