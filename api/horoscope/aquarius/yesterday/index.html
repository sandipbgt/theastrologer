    "horoscope": "Welcome to a day full of interesting exchanges and food for thought. It's a great day for social get-togethers, because you and everyone around you are in the mood for fun. Even if a disagreement arises, you'll be fine. You can see both sides of a given issue, making it easy to be diplomatic as you seek to satisfy everyone involved. Any tension dissipates quickly, dissolving in laughter and conversation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
