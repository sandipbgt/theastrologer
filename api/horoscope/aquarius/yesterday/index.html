    "horoscope": "It's time to let go of old hostilities, once and for all. You have neither the time nor the energy to keep that kind of bad feeling going. Instead, make a conscious decision to forgive and move on. This fresh intellectual approach will broaden your narrow mind into something much more creative and inclusive. Besides, you need people around you. If they know you're aware of how important they are, they're more likely to offer their support and assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
