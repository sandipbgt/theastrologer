You've been there and done that, and tried to put it behind you. Expect it to get a lot more personal today as your heart warms up and your intimate relationships are highlighted. You know the saying 'If you love someone, set them free.' It should be easy enough to do that today and you'll be glad you did, once your loved one returns to you, proving their devotion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
