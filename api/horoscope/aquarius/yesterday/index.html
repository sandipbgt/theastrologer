Your creativity is turned on by the idea that there really are no boundaries -- that the world is your oyster, and you can go anywhere you want and accomplish anything you set your mind to.

You're in a playful mood but you still need others' support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
