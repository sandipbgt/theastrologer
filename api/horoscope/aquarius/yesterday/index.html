    "horoscope": "Soon you could go head to head with someone over an important decision or project. But why not get tactical instead? You aren't as set in your ways as everyone thinks. All you need is a positive attitude, and you're instantly teachable. And everyone likes working with someone who is humble. If you take a moderate approach to learning something new now, you're almost certain to score points with one of the VIPs in your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
