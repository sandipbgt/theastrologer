    "horoscope": "Normally you love being in a group of people. But today you feel like a hermit, and that's okay. Sometimes staying home is the best thing you can do for your health, both mental and physical. This is the perfect time for you to spend some quality time reconnecting with yourself. Gardening, watching a movie, baking or writing in your journal would all be good uses of your time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
