The only thing that could get in the way of a truly exciting day might be your own tendency toward stubbornness! If you encounter someone strong-willed, resolve to be the one who gives way. This will surely be an interesting learning experience, and you're detached enough from your own ego that it shouldn't be difficult.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
