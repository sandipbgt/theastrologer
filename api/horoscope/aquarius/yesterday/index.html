It could even be a spiritual journey if that's what you want to call it, although there are often obvious differences of opinion about what's holy and what's unholy. But basically, if it moves you, you're good to go. And whether you throw yourself into the moment with sacred fervor or profane delight, feel free to ask questions, explore new avenues, and diversify your interests. It'll be OK to spread yourself thin today. There will be enough of you to go around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
