Cut away the excess to shed some light on the deep sincerity that's still at the core of all your choices. That ought to improve your mood today, don't you think? You've been stuck under that dark cloud of yours for too long. Maybe you'll never want to return from this brighter perspective. Don't worry about people calling you a foolish optimist. As an optimist, you're a lot easier to be around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
