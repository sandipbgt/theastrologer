    "horoscope": "In the past, you were outspoken about your visions for the future. Today you'll gladly keep to yourself. These ideas you're coming up with are too thrilling and tenuous to share just yet. Whether you're wrapped up in a new relationship, a creative project or an idea that could change how people live all over the world, you realize it's still in the conception stages. If people care where you've gone and what you're doing, let them guess. You'll revisit reality when you're good and ready -- probably sooner rather than later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
