If you're in a bit of a mood, your best bet is to keep a sense of humor about you, and stick to comfortingly familiar people and places. You may prefer to spend some time alone today, and that's fine too. You'll rejoin your friends and your usual activities when you're ready. The key now is to respect your feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
