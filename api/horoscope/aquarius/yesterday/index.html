    "horoscope": "Your humanitarian side comes to the fore today. You're attuned to helping others in any way you can. This might mean lending a hand in someone's project in a physical way, but it's even more likely to occur in an intellectual realm. Your strength right now is in finding new ways to revamp old systems. You bring real creativity to the table, so put this skill to good use.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
