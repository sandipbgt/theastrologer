    "horoscope": "It's easy to bury yourself in work today. You've tapped into a slow-and-steady flow, and your output is consistent all day long. You could lose yourself for hours in a project, if it weren't for your pesky friends and family! They keep calling or popping in, asking you to quit working and join them in whatever fun  they've got going. Relax,. Spend some time with your loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
