You're an inventive person by nature, but that part of your personality may not get much expression right now. Instead of being creative, be practical. Assess a situation with a real-world eye for the bottom line. Then decide how to move forward, and proceed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
