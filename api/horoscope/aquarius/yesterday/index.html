    "horoscope": "Loosen and lighten up today. If you've been stuck in your head, working on a project or a puzzle, get centered again in your body. Indulge everyday physical cravings for food, hugs and laughter. Join your friends for some unstructured fun. And if you feel suddenly nervous because you realize just how much you need other people's attention, relax. That's a very human need,, and one that everyone shares.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
