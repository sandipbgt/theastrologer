    "horoscope": "Be bold today, and tap into your creativity. Your imagination is on fire, stimulated by the current cosmic energy boost. A burst of passion could help you push through a project. It can also make a personal relationship a lot more fun! Of course, passion can also signify flaring tempers, and conflict tends to make you uncomfortable. If someone needs to express their feelings, hang in there. It's just that kind of day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
