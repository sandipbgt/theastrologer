    "horoscope": "You're a humanitarian at heart, and today, that compassionate streak of yours is highlighted in a big way. It's hard for you to see someone in need without lending any assistance you possibly can. The good thing is, unlike some people, you have strong personal boundaries. You know where to draw the line, so it's rare that you overextend yourself in a bid to help others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
