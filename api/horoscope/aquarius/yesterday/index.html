    "horoscope": "You can be stubborn sometimes, but today is a good day to cooperate. Seek a compromise, even if you secretly believe your way is best. Giving a little ground makes everyone feel better, including you. This goes for your personal relationships as well as business connections today. You'll find that making the effort to create harmony with others is easier than you think. And its positive effects will be far-reaching.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
