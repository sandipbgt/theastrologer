Whatever your goals or interests are, you can use the energy and high spirits this brief period brings to take big steps forward. Don't be afraid to knock on many doors, either literally or figuratively. If you feel shy about talking yourself up, just remember: You have skills or information people want.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
