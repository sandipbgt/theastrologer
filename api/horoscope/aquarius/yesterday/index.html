    "horoscope": "Today, keep one eye on the potential for success, and keep another on anyone you know who could help you reach it. There are lots of allies around you, you know -- some even quite unexpected. You can gain a lot of support if you just keep your eyes and mind open to it. This is about using all your available resources, so don't discount someone simply because their vision seems different from yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
