Just be honest about your expectations and your methods. Of course, there's honesty, and then there's selective honesty. With a positive spin, this could turn out well for everyone today. They hear what sounds good to them, you get what you want, and you're all happy. And if you're among like-minded people, the fun is just beginning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
