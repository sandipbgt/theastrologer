    "horoscope": "Original thinking takes you far today. Innovative ideas come fast and furious. Your only task is to keep up with them! There's little you can't accomplish now. Channel this feeling into something important. Use it to get a favorite project off the ground, or to think on your feet in a professional or creative setting. Use your imagination, and don't bother being cautious. You're going for the glory.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
