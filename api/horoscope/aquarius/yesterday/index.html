    "horoscope": "For someone who is normally pretty self-assured, today you feel remarkably flexible. The edges of your life aren't as sharply defined as usual. Boundaries fade. What used to seem perfectly clear is now murky. Even old loyalties seem questionable -- something you never thought would happen. Was this change inevitable? Only time can answer that with certainty.
