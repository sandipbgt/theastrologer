    "horoscope": "Forward thinking will benefit from a little extra oomph today. Here's how it works. The energy pouring out from your heart will amplify the logic already buzzing in your head. The scars and bruises from your past won't make you afraid of where you might still try to go. Past accidents are lessons that don't have to restrict you. When you express yourself under these conditions, you'll find that all the separate parts are working together now. Be good to yourself, be happy, and become something more than you ever thought you could be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
