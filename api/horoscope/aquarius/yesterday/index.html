    "horoscope": "You're a stranger in a strange land today, because you see the future clearly even as others are busy gazing at the past. Strange needs are driving you forward against the stream. Call it creative tension or artistic license -- either way, you're not seeing things quite the same way as everyone else. Today, the outcome will be as important as the process. The changes you make now will have measurable results.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
