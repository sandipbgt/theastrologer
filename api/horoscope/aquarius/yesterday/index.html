    "horoscope": "You're an inventor, an artist or a fashionista at heart. You live on the cutting edge, making the discoveries and setting the trends that the rest of the world won't embrace until later. But the best thing about you is that you're bringing such a lighthearted, free-spirited vibe to the world. Some people think 'avant-garde' means dark, anguished and impossible to understand, but you know otherwise. You're laughing -- kindly -- at anyone who doesn't catch on. This is your time to tap-dance along the leading edge of life. Relish this incredible energy surge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
