    "horoscope": "You have great staying power today. This comes in handy at work or when you're tackling a big project. It's an excellent time to work on something tedious or complex. You don't mind lengthy or repetitive jobs as much as usual. A solid sense of satisfaction comes from marking your progress. And it's easy to see the bottom line -- the simplest solution to a problem, or the most straightforward way to get the job done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
