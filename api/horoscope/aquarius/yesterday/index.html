You might prefer to set your feelings aside and take a completely unsentimental view of things, but that may not be possible. Sometimes, life has a way of pushing you into a corner and forcing you to face your feelings. At least you can take comfort in the fact that this will pass quickly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
