    "horoscope": "That morose attitude isn't getting you anywhere. Perk up! After all, there's nothing you can do about today's heavy energy hanging, but you can change your perspective. Instead of indulging in a gloom-and-doom view of the world, focus on the positive people and events that surround you. Seek out good friends who make you laugh. Go fun places where that uneasy feeling seems like a figment of your imagination. Which, by the way, it is. Good feelings surround you. It just might take a shift in your outlook to realize it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
