    "horoscope": "Feeling like a bit of an outsider? If so, it's okay. You enjoy knowing you're unique among your friends. But this is no reason to withdraw from life. Maybe you're stuck in a different perspective than everyone else, but it's only for today. Soon you'll feel more a part of things again.

You could realize that their perspective is closer to the truth than yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
