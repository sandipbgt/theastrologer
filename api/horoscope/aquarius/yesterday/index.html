    "horoscope": "Being open-minded is one of your best qualities. Today it will be more of an effort than usual to embrace new ideas and untested methods. Of course, traditional approaches are sometimes appropriate. In fact, that's another of your natural strengths -- you know when to innovate, and when to rely on the tried-and-true. Today, try not to rely so heavily on established habits. Break out of your own expectations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
