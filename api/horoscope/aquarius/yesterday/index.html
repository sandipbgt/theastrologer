You're disciplined, your energy is strong, and you know what you're working toward and why. That's really the most important part. It's so much easier to reach a goal when you know why it's significant. That also helps you envision it more clearly, which is another important component of success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
