    "horoscope": "After a dreamy couple of days, your mind sharpens and your energy returns full-force. You feel like getting involved again in the world around you. You have a clear vision of what you want to do, and you know which friends or colleagues you'll ask to help you make it happen. Just make sure you aren't jumping into anything too quickly. Normally, you're an ace at planning. Use that skill now and avoid problems later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
