    "horoscope": "It's a good thing you enjoy working on creative solutions to problems. Today brings a troubled feeling to your life, as if you're working against yourself in some way without even realizing it. You're wrapped up in your own paradox, but maybe that's okay. Pay attention to what you think and how you feel. Your perceptions are a little off, but they also hold clues to the answers you seek. Enlightenment could be right around the corner -- you just have to be tuned in and sharp enough to recognize it when it comes along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
