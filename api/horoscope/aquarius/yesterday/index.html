    "horoscope": "The cautious, shrewd part of your nature takes over today. If you have an important goal in mind, you could take solid steps toward it today, or at least make some sensible, feasible plans for the future. You understand the need to be mindful of how you move forward, especially in your career or on some other important project. You know that without a solid foundation, even the most innovative ideas will fall flat.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
