It's time to inspect your fears and worries, and finally break out of this loop. Even if a certain situation or relationship seems tricky, you still have plenty of time to salvage things. Just be fair, open-minded, and as easygoing as possible. Treating people with respect will take you much further than rudeness or condescension.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
