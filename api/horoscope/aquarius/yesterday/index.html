    "horoscope": "Maybe you're looking for a new friend or lover. Perhaps you're fishing for compliments. Or, you think you're solving the crime of the century. Who knows what's going on? Others certainly won't have a clue. In fact, they're probably wondering why you're snooping around and making bizarre accusations. Uh-oh. Is this another case of your reality vs. theirs? Regroup today, whether you're working alone or with a team of detectives or talent scouts. It's time to get a better grip on the situation. Be ready to cheerfully accept whatever you learn.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
