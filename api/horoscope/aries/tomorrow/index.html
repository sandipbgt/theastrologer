    "horoscope": "It's important to be sensitive to other people's feelings and needs today. Many people are a little emotionally fragile at the moment. If you deal with them in your usual brash way, you might hurt their feelings without realizing it! So put on your nicest smile and your gentlest tone. This might feel silly, but it will go a long way toward creating a pleasant atmosphere with your friends and coworkers.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
