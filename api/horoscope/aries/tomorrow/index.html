    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic energy is like a breath of fresh. You're ready to make a change of some kind. Better yet, a revolution! And you certainly have the energy and the vision to make something truly out of the ordinary happen. Your curiosity is aroused. Unusual people and experiences beckon. You don't care what you do or whom you do it with -- you just want to see, do or feel something brand-new.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
