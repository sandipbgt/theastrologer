    "horoscope": "Your passionate nature lies right at the surface today. Tap into this for positive, intense experiences, like intimacy with someone you love. But do your best to stay calm when passion of a different kind threatens to overwhelm you. Angry outbursts are possible now, since your emotions are strong and stirred up. Desire could turn dark if feelings like jealousy or possessiveness well up within you. Try to stay lighthearted and relaxed!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
