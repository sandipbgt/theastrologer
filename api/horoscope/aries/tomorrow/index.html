    "horoscope": "Your mood softens today. Many people are feeling more sensitive now than usual, so it's smart to treat them with gentle care. Otherwise, your usual high energy might lead you to step on someone's toes without realizing what you're doing. But that's less likely now, since you simply aren't feeling that boisterous. It's a good day for a heart-to-heart with a friend. Get something off your chest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
