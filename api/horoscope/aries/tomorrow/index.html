    "horoscope": "This is a day to challenge yourself and explore undiscovered frontiers. This should be easy, since you're generally fearless in the face of new ideas or experiences. You could discover a humanitarian streak you didn't realize you had, as you throw yourself into projects. Global concerns seem especially important and poignant now. You genuinely want to make a difference. With your energy, that shouldn't be difficult at all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
