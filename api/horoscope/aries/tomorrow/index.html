It might be a good day to stay home, or spend time with the people you love and trust most. At least they know how to handle you when you're feeling grouchy! And they're also the people with whom you feel most comfortable talking about your feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
