    "horoscope": "Be careful of other people's sensitive spots today. You're honest and straightforward, and that's definitely part of your charm. But on days like today, when many people are feeling moody and vulnerable, it's best to tread lightly. Avoid pushing buttons or criticizing others. If you have to give feedback or correct someone's thinking or behavior, do so as constructively as possible. It usually helps to lead with a compliment!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
