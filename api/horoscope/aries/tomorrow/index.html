No, you won't take direction very well under the current influence! You want to chart your own path, and the universe may align to let you do just that. But if you do have to toe the line with your employer or someone else, do so as gracefully as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
