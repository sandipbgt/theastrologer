    "horoscope": "Watch how your enthusiasm makes ripples in the world. And while you're watching, notice how certain people will catch your eye today. They'll arouse your passions or give you reason to be suspicious. Be up front about what's in the back of your mind. In fact, show courage whatever you do. Thanks to good instincts, your emotions will be on your side. Thanks to your overall fitness or lucky moments of coordination, your body will do what you tell it. Trust yourself and have fun no matter what else happens to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
