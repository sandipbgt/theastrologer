Pay attention to what's happening around you as well as checking your own behavior. There are people out there who may try to fool you today. If you're going to be that gullible, at least make sure you're flexible enough to live with it tomorrow. If you're really creative, you'll turn the tables on whoever scams you. Good for you, and don't let it happen again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
