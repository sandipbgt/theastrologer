    "horoscope": "Stick to a routine today. As dull as it may sound, efficiency is best now, because it emphasizes both quality and productivity. That may mean you'll have to moderate your energy carefully. Fortunately, it's easier than usual to draw on it slowly and steadily. That helps you temper your usual leap-first, look-later approach! It's also smart to make a plan before you act, so you can avoid unnecessary mistakes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
