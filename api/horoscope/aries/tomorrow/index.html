    "horoscope": "Your basic instincts may come into play today. You probably won't understand why you do or say the things you do. You might not realize there's a lot of heavy emotion behind your actions, pushing you to behave in ways you might not be proud of later. There's a fix for this, however.  Be honest with yourself about how you're feeling. Then you can be honest with others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
