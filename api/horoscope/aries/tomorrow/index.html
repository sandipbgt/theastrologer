    "horoscope": "Welcome to an emotionally sensitive day. Watch your behavior toward other people. You're prone to reacting without thinking, and this is doubly true when your feelings are hurt. The chance of this happening increases under the current influence, because your emotions are stirred up. If you find yourself snapping at someone, take it as a sign that you're feeling a little vulnerable. Instead of lashing out, try talking it out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
