    "horoscope": "Today you're filled with a refreshing sense of adventure. Possibility and opportunity abound, and you're lucky enough to have the courage to take advantage -- not to mention the energy! You're quite spirited, so stay physically active, and keep your mind alive as well. Now is the perfect time for a day trip to someplace you've never been before. If you have no time for that, start planning a future vacation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
