And isn't telling the straight truth just so much more interesting? You could light aunder someone without even trying! Which is always good for a few laughs. Don't do anything just for laughs now, though -- try to have a point, too. That's part of what being practical is all about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
