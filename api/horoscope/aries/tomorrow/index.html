    "horoscope": "You're always energetic, but today you manage to look elegant as you blaze trails. Of course, your style is your very own, and people have always been drawn to that certain independent flair of yours. But now it's as if you're on, smoldering from the inside out. Put this to good use. Turn on the charm and court a new client or romantic interest. Let everyone know what you're capable of doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
