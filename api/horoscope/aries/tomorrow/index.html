    "horoscope": "Make an extra effort to be kind today. People need your compassion. And giving it will make you feel better. You're just as influenced by the current energy as everyone else. It softens you up and puts you more closely in touch with the workings of your own heart. It's easier to get your feelings hurt now. That's where the Golden Rule comes in -- treating others with the gentle care with which you want to be treated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
