Did you ever realize it could feel this wonderful to accomplish something that benefits everyone? It feels good to be good. Think about what means most to you and to the people you care about, and make it happen. This is your big chance, and you, of all people, know how to get the ball rolling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
