    "horoscope": "Grounded energy fills you today. You could use this to work steadily on something that's important to you. You might use it to dig your heels in about a certain issue. It's wonderful to feel passionate about something, but flexibility is also important. Under the current influence, that's a quality you may lack! At least your newfound staying power gives you the strength to hang in there when the going gets tough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
