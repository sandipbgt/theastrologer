    "horoscope": "You have needs right now, don't you? And plenty of worries and concerns, too. What you may not realize is that your cravings are making you insensitive to the needs of others. Something inside you is trying to convince you that your life is lacking in some way. What you need to do is switch over to the part of you that knows the world is a better place. Personal growth today will be rewarding. And productive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
