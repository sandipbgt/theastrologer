    "horoscope": "Getting a lot of work done may be a lost cause today, unless you're a party planner or a PR person. You're just too excited and excitable! Focusing isn't on the agenda. There's too much to talk about with every person you see. You turn a chance gathering into a party, just with the force of your charisma. See if you can make some good contacts today, in all your chatty wanderings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
