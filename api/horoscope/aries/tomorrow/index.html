    "horoscope": "You need freedom today. This can lead to great things, if you can get the time and space you need to indulge your curiosity. But your sweetheart, friend or boss may try to rein you in. If they do, understand that they're just following their instincts and doing what they think is right. But even within the confines of a job or a relationship, you can and should enjoy intellectual freedom.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
