    "horoscope": "Take a scholarly approach to your work or studies today. Your mind is even keener than usual, enabling you to view a problem or situation with a dispassionate, scientific eye. Taking emotion out of the equation can be a real help in determining the right move or plan, because your thinking is purely logical. You're also open to experimentation based on your own observations, so keep an idea log and get to work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
