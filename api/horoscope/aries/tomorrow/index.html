    "horoscope": "Life is moving at a slower pace today. It's a good time to connect with your loved ones. Be affectionate and nurturing, especially with children, or with anyone who's feeling a little sensitive. Of course, most people are extra sensitive right now, and pretty much everyone could use a hug! So give them out freely. You could use that extra bit of warmth and human contact, yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
