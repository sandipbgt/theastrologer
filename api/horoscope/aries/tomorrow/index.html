    "horoscope": "There will be no lack of energy for you today, no matter what you did yesterday. You'll probably wake up early, raring to go. Get some exercise, but don't ignore working out your mind, too. Your curiosity is abundant today, not to mention your zest for adventure and life itself. Let this natural enthusiasm inspire other people -- but try to avoid overwhelming them. You wouldn't want to hold yourself back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
