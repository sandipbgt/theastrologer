    "horoscope": "Today you gravitate naturally toward the spotlight. Your energy is warm and boisterous, and you're definitely in the mood to be in front of a crowd of admirers. You feed off the energy of their appreciation! And since your charisma is on high now, you're likely to get a lot of positive feedback from others who are drawn to your strength and optimism. Have a great time with this influence!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
