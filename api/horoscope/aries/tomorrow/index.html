    "horoscope": "You don't enjoy feeling indecisive, but a wishy-washy mood could steal over you today. Perhaps you're trying to make a tough decision, and you're all too aware that whatever you choose will affect someone other than yourself. Normally, you have no trouble making tough choices. But now, you might feel conflicted. If so, ask for input from other people, and always keep common ground as a goal in your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
