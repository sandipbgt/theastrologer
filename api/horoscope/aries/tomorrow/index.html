    "horoscope": "For you, taking leadership often means bringing high energy and vision to the table. But you also have a brusque, no-nonsense way about you that may not work out well today. Your leadership skills are currently highlighted, but it's especially important now to treat other people with compassion. Most people are in sensitive moods, and many have low energy. Prodding at them could result in a display of temper.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
