    "horoscope": "You'll probably make some abrupt turns today. You probably won't talk about them, either, unless people get in your face and start demanding a few answers. What'll you tell them? You have to say something. Silence is one more obstacle to overcome, because when it comes to making guesses about your behavior, others control the spin. You could say, 'I was wrong,' 'I didn't know,' or 'This looks worse than it is.' Maybe you won't get a lot of help by coming clean, but maybe you won't get quite so much pressure, either.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
