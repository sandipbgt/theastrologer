    "horoscope": "You may be hypersensitive to change, because things have always been like this -- even when they weren't.  Maybe you're worried about potential sacrifices, and that could turn you into a dictator. Needless to say, this kind of nervousness is unusual for you. Use this day to reevaluate where you stand. You may be positioned in a very different place from where you thought you were. What's good is that you can move in any direction from here. Consider the possibilities, take a deep breath and take your first step.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
