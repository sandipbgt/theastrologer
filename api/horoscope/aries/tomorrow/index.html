    "horoscope": "Be sure to do some exercise today, and eat regular meals. Get a good sleep tonight, too. These simple measures will help you stay emotionally even. On the other hand, not taking care of your physical well-being could put you in a mood. Try not to slip into melancholy or to get upset over minor issues. Do your best to stay calm, and the world will seem calmer too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
