    "horoscope": "You can see that a project or relationship needs a jolt of energy, and you know just how to deliver it. But a gentle, tactful approach will work better than a pointed one today. Not everyone responds to barbs and challenges the way you do, you know. Plenty of people are more sensitive than you realize, and a softer touch could work wonders in rallying the troops or spicing up an intimate connection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
