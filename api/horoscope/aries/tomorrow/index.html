    "horoscope": "Hanging out with good friends is one of the best things you can do today. You're public-spirited and up for good times with special people. But you're more aware than usual of all the ways in which you could work to improve life for your fellow humans. Toss ideas around with your friends, and stay open to suggestions and debate. Together you can come up with an ingenious, workable plan for getting things done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
