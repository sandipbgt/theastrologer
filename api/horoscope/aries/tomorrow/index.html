    "horoscope": "Ask a friend to join you today in some vigorous exercise. It's good to be with other people now, but working up a sweat together on the trail or in the gym is a more productive use of your time together than chatting over coffee. That chat could all too quickly turn into an argument, because your temper is still running hot. With exercise, you can burn off this tricky energy along with some calories.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
