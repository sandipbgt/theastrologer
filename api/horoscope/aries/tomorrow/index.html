If you don't, a pessimistic mood could set in before you know it. Soon you'll be snapping at your coworker or spouse -- and you'll only regret it later. But working long and hard toward a particular goal that means a lot to you can help you avoid that type of issue.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
