If you have a positive outlet for this overflow of feeling -- and you know what kind of positive outlet that means! -- then it should be quite an enjoyable day. But if not, you could create an outlet, which could get messy. Avoid confrontations by getting some vigorous exercise or expressing your feelings appropriately. And remember, sometimes, it's good to keep secrets.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
