    "horoscope": "Moodiness rears its head out of nowhere. It can be difficult for you to keep a handle on your emotions, and today, you may find yourself sulking or snapping at people. You are probably  more sensitive now than usual, so you're taking things personally that weren't meant that way. Just keep that in mind as you proceed through the day. Put on your 'thick skin' and let things roll off.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
