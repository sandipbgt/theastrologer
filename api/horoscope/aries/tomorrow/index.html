    "horoscope": "You may be feeling a little touchy today, and it isn't as simple as the world conspiring against you. In truth, your emotions are just a little more tender than usual -- and you aren't used to feeling this sensitive. Your temper may be stirred up by the simplest, most innocent comments. If so, try not to react too rashly. Take a deep breath, and when in doubt, talk it out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
