    "horoscope": "You're a natural leader, and today, that part of your personality is especially prominent. But it could be tricky to balance your wish to be in charge with the concurrent emphasis on teamwork. Cooperative efforts are favored today, so push yourself to accommodate others' needs and opinions, even if they don't mesh well with your own. After all, part of being a good head honcho is uniting your team.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
