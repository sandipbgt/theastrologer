    "horoscope": "Life takes a slow, dreamy turn today. Your usual energy is dampened by the heaviness of pure emotion. This may take the form of a melancholy mood, or it might just hamper your attention span. When you try to focus, your mind wanders. Perhaps you shouldn't try so hard! Let your thoughts meander where they will. Get some extra sleep, if you can. Your dreams are likely to be very intense!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
