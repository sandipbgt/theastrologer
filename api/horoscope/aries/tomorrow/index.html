Just be aware of the impression you're making on the group, especially when meeting someone new. Tactless comments won't settle well, because there's an emphasis now on good manners and refined behavior. Save your bawdy humor for the people who know you well!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
