    "horoscope": "You're a natural leader, and that's especially apparent today. Your intensity at work or among friends is infectious. You can get everyone revved up and ready to go! Of course, that quick-burn energy of yours could burn out fast. That's why it's important to strike while the iron is hot. When an idea occurs to you, jump in and make it happen. Your impulsive streak is your friend right now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
