    "horoscope": "You might feel nitpicked and criticized today. Someone in a position of authority in your life -- your parents or employer, perhaps -- certainly has high standards! And today they're higher than ever. It seems unfair for them to pick on your performance, and their harsh judgments make you prickly. On the other hand, maybe they aren't trying to hurt your feelings. Perhaps they're genuinely trying to encourage you to do your best. Rise to the challenge!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
