    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if irritation gets the best of you today and your anger erupts. But don't give in to every snappish urge. Even if someone is seriously getting on your nerves, you can still treat them with calm respect. Why not make this a personal challenge? See if you can get through the day without exchanging harsh words with anyone. If you can, you can bet your soul will have grown at least a couple of notches.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
