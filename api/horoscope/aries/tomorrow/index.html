But whatever you're facing and however you handle it, you won't be the only one coping with this stuff. Your neighborhood or workplace might be affected, too. Rough times can make people snide and stingy, but you don't have to be part of the problem. You may already know how to solve it. Give graciously and they'll follow your example.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
