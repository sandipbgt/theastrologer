And with your energy, you can really make a difference. So if an opportunity to be of service presents itself, take it. Helping someone in need is an emotionally fulfilling experience. It also helps you realize how well off you truly are. And that, dear, is priceless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
