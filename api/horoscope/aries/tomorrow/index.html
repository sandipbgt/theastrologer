    "horoscope": "A sense of grounded calm comes over you today. This matches well with the pace of things around you, because life is definitely rolling along more slowly than it was yesterday. And while you might prefer excitement, it's best to get comfortable with this mellow vibe, because it's here to stay -- for another day or two, anyway. While it's here, take this chance to relax and connect with yourself or your loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
