    "horoscope": "You can be quite the charmer when you want to be. That's a good skill to tap into today, when cooperation with others is even more important than usual. You may have to take a 'fake it till you make it' approach -- smiling and nodding, even when you feel like rolling your eyes -- but that's better than the alternative! Do your best to listen to others and incorporate their ideas with your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
