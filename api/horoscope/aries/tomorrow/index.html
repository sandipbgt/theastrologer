Too many rules or expectations will just have you rebelling like a teenager! It's a lot better to seek the freedom you crave and channel that energy to explore. Find positive ways to flout the rules. Be your daring self, and take risks that pay off. And have a great time doing it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
