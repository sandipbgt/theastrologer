    "horoscope": "You're in an upbeat, social mood today. In fact, you might be feeling just a little bit wacky! And you're attracted to zany people with original, unique points of view. In conversation, there's a sense of exploration as you learn about others' careers and interests. It's easy to get fired up now. You may even end up being inspired by someone's work, and taking on their favorite cause as your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
