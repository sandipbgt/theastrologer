You can roam far and wide, exploring the nooks and crannies of anything that captures your interest. You'll remember these adventures when you're not feeling quite so free-spirited, and that shift could happen at any time, so enjoy the present moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
