Today's lighthearted vibe is for playing as if you're a kid again, or getting outside for a walk or a run, or playing a game of touch football with your friends. Whatever you do, just be sure to put your high energy to use. If you don't channel it, it could turn into restlessness or even frustration.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
