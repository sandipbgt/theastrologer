    "horoscope": "A sentimental mood overtakes you today. You're normally so energetic and even sharp-edged, but now you're in a softer, sweeter frame of mind. You want to reach out and connect with the people you know and love, so call a friend or visit a relative. If you work in a creative field, pay special attention to your dreams and daydreams, because these are rich mines of information and creativity now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
