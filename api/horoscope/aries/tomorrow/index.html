    "horoscope": "Today, you're in the mood to lie around on the couch and eat bonbons. But while this might seem like a good idea in the short term, you have to consider the long-term effects on your health. It's important right now to eat well and get good sleep and exercise, even if it doesn't seem very fun. Still, you'll be glad you did later, when you're enjoying the benefits of increased energy and a vigorous, happy mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
