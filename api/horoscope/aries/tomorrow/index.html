    "horoscope": "Of course you're confident. Confidence is your middle name. Throw yourself into the game with this newfound courage, because it will take that kind of commitment for you to see your strength and individuality with new eyes. There's only one of you and you're only as young as you let yourself be. But be mature enough to know where you are and what you're supposed to be doing. Find that need and fill it today, while you still have reason to be excited. Hang onto this feeling and make it work for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
