    "horoscope": "You're feeling more serene than usual. Don't worry, it'll pass! Just kidding -- but remember that though you might pretend to be calm and simple today, everyone can see right through you. Which means your strong personality shines through even the dullest of days, which is a good thing. So why not keep the illusion going for a while? Be helpful and cooperative. Soon you'll return to your energetic, self-directed ways.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
