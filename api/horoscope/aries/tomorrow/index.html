The problem is, today isn't about operating alone -- it's about working closely with someone you value. Of course, they may not be as clear on what they want. You'll just have to rely on your crafty charm to get them in your corner! Good thing you're even more charming than usual. You can make just about anything happen, if you put your mind to it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
