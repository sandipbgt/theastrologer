    "horoscope": "Life's pace slows and mellows today. You're used to a speedier tempo, but you can appreciate the lazy feeling, especially if you get to enjoy it with someone special. Spending time with family or friends is fun now, too. There's a heightened sense of togetherness pulling you closer. It's easy to relax in each other's company. Don't fight this easygoing vibe; get into it, because it's very fleeting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
