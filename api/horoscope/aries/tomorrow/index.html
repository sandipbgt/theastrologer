    "horoscope": "You aren't one to back down from a fight, which could keep you pretty busy today. Many people are closely tied to their egos or emotions now. They might behave aggressively, but passive-aggression is much more common. And you won't stand for that ! You'd rather have things right out in the open, so you know what you're dealing with. At least that way it's cleaner, even if things get tense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
