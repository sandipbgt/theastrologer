You might play this out physically or emotionally, such as discussing your deepest feelings with a therapist or trusted friend. However you choose to exercise this energy, do try to keep it within the realm of positive self-discovery. Arguments can be intense and revealing, but they aren't much fun for anyone involved!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
