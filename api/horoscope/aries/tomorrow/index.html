    "horoscope": "Your normally intense drive softens today. Now you're more tuned in to others' feelings and needs than usual, and you want to help someone who requires it. Your high energy and initiative come in handy now, because many people around you don't seem to have nearly enough of those qualities. So lend yourself to a worthy cause, whether that's a friend in need, a charity drive or some other ideal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
