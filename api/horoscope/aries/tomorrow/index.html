    "horoscope": "Today, spend time thinking, feeling and fantasizing. This could mean reading or watching a movie, or daydreaming on the couch. Napping is good, too -- especially if you keep a journal by the bed, so you can record your dreams when you wake up. You may notice that both your dreams and your feelings are more vivid now. If you pay attention to them, they could reveal something interesting and important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
