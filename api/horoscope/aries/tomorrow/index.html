With your natural energy, you can keep the whole group productive and lively. Just don't let this go to your head. You're a natural leader,, but if you try too hard to become the captain, others might start resenting your position of power. Instead of barking orders, make smart, pithy suggestions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
