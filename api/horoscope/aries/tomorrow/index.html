Keep your schedule flexible, because as friends call and colleagues send emails, you'll want the freedom to jump on last-minute invitations and opportunities! This might be your favorite kind of day -- the kind when all you can expect is the unexpected. There's an exciting charge to the atmosphere around you. Practice necessary cautions, of course. Beyond that, have fun following your bliss.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
