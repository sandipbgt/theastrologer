    "horoscope": "Your energy is off the charts today! This almost ensures that you'll have a great day, thanks to your madcap approach to life. But do watch out for ill-considered decisions. Your impulsive streak is one of your best traits, but when it flares to life, a little too much daring or exuberance can lead to mistakes. On the positive side, you're quick on your feet, so you learn from your missteps.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
