    "horoscope": "You've got big plans, and now is the time to put everything in motion. Don't worry -- even if you're nervous, you'll have plenty of courage and energy when it's time to act. Strength and performance are everything today. Don't be afraid to ask friends or coworkers for their assistance. They'll be glad to play supporting roles, because they believe in you, almost more than you believe in yourself -- and that's saying a lot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
