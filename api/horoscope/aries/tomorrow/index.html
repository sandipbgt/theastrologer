    "horoscope": "Today it's important to make an emotional connection with the people around you. Keep in mind that many people are feeling more sensitive now than usual -- you included. So keep biting comments and snarky jokes to a minimum! You might just be poking fun, but someone else could get their feelings hurt. And if you're the one who feels a little blue today, give yourself some space to sit with those emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
