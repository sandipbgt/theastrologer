    "horoscope": "With your high energy and enthusiasm, you're on top of the world today, and in charge of your own destiny. Just don't forget that first impressions count for a lot, as do subsequent ones, and insensitive behavior could obliterate your good standing with someone you'd like to impress. So don't dismantle all your hard, careful work; be nice. Make a few jokes at your own expense. Humility will keep them coming back for more.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
