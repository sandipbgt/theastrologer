    "horoscope": "With your long list of responsibilities, maybe it's better to work on your own today. At least that way, no one challenges your authority or hinders your forward progress.

Sometimes, life is about busy work and crossing tasks off your to-do list, and this may be one of those days.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
