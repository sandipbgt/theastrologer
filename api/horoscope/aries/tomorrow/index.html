    "horoscope": "It may be difficult to control your temper today -- which is all the more reason to try! The current influence has you feeling quite emotional. Even on a good day, your tendency is to react without thinking. So when strong feelings like resentment or irritation well up, do your best to stay calm. Quick responses to emotional situations could just make things worse, whereas a levelheaded view will help keep everyone calm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
