    "horoscope": "Multitasking is your strong point today, and it's a lot of fun, too. You might chat on your cell phone while you're exercising, or text your friends during a business meeting. Best of all, if your boss catches you in a distracted moment, it's easy to think on your feet and come up with a charming excuse! Use this talent sparingly, though. You can find a more proactive use for your creativity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
