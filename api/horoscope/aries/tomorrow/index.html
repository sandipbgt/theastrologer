    "horoscope": "Despite being your usual fiery self, you've found the balance between your own interests and others' boundaries, at least for today. Cooperating with friends now will bring great results, whether your project is a pickup softball game or a fledgling business venture. Throwing all your passion into a joint venture is almost certain to bring great results, so don't hold back. Be the-starter that you are -- tell the others your ideas and rally them into action.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
