    "horoscope": "Oh, look. You're impulsive today. Before you know it, you'll be talking back, throwing down and acting up. It'll be all about gotcha, keep-away and made-ya-look. So what's up with the juvenile behavior, anyway? It takes two to play, and with your luck you'll engage either the right person or the wrong one, depending on how you look at it. Names might be called. Feelings might be hurt. You might let this whole thing go way too far if you're not careful. Be more forgiving if you want to be forgiven.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
