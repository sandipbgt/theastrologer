    "horoscope": "Everyone's dissatisfied at one time or another. But when the straw breaks the camel's back, you may find yourself blowing up beyond reason. Just chill, OK? Rein in your fury. Crank the volume all the way down and stuff those demons back into their box. Bringing out the full package now would come with a big price tag. Avoid sticker shock when you see what you've done. In fact, avoid all shocks by not doing anything you'll regret. Retire meekly to your corner and try again tomorrow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
