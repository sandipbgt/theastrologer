    "horoscope": "You might be surprised today at how emotional you are. A sappy movie -- one you'd normally laugh at -- could leave you feeling melancholy. Music might affect you strongly now, too. You're more susceptible to emotional triggers, which means you're a lot softer than usual. This could be a strange and uncomfortable state for you! Still, just go with it. Sometimes it's nice to feel your feelings so deeply.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
