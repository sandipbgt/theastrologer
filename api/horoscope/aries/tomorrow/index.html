Of course, from your point of view, they're going out of their way to irk you, so you think your behavior is justified. Just remember, you have control over how you treat people. You'll hang on to everyone's support if you can keep your temper in check and play nice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
