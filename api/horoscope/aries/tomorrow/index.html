    "horoscope": "Your past may reassert itself today. Perhaps an old friend contacts you out of the blue, or a childhood memory floats to the surface. Whatever happens, it brings up tough emotions. Loss and sadness have a way of ebbing and flowing like the tide. Today's intense emotions will surely recede by tomorrow. So let yourself feel them. Then they can subside once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
