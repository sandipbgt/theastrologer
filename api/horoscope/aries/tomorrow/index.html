    "horoscope": "Life could get a little tricky today. Unexpected emotions are rising to the surface of your mind. Your moods may change quickly, especially as you interact with other people. You share a lot of love with your friends and family, but they can also drive you crazy! Try to keep your cool today if someone hurts your feelings or gets under your skin. Talk it out instead of lashing out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
