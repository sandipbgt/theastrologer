    "horoscope": "You've got something to boast about today, or at least you feel as if you do. You're filled with a sense of excitement. You might be in a romantic or passionate mood. Give that energy expression, whether through a relationship or a work of great creativity. And don't worry about coming across as arrogant if your good humor boils over and you do a little bragging. You're charming enough to make it come off well!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
