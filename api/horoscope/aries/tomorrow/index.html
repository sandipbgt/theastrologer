    "horoscope": "You're no stranger to combative energy, but today's over the top when it comes to arguments with those around you. Old problems flare up again out of nowhere, demanding your attention. The problem is, the kind of attention you're able to give now might just make things worse. You're stingy with praise and quick to criticize others' efforts, which is a real problem if there's anyone working under you or seeking your approval, such as employees, friends, or children. At least this mood will pass soon, which will be a real relief.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
