Once you've got that inner fire stoked, let its warmth spill out onto the rest of the world! Let your loved ones know just how you feel about them. If you're doing creative work, put every scrap of personality and inventiveness you possess into it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
