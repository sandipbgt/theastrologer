    "horoscope": "Today your head will be clear of jumbled thoughts and inconvenient feelings. Empathy for the underdog might soften your energy a little, but don't worry about getting left in the corner at parties. You'll still be fun to have around. That's because you're finally starting to understand and love others for who they are, instead of jumping to conclusions about how they should be. It's time to bring your people skills back on line and exert some influence with the movers and shakers who can make a difference.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
