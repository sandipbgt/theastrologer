    "horoscope": "Things feel like they're coming together for you. Instead of feeling restless, your current outlook is calm and cerebral. Somehow you've got it all figured out: Your facts and figures are in a row, and you even have a refreshing, ingenious idea for a solution. You've decoded the underlying meaning, too. Normally you're happiest being an independent player, but today it feels great to be a member of the team.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
