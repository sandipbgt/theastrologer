    "horoscope": "Try to learn a new way of being today. You're so into spontaneity and immediacy that you have no problem acting on impulse. There are times when that works for you, and other times when it doesn't. Today, test out a more considered approach. This will require some practice, since it's such a different M.O. from your usual one. But you're likely to find that the benefits outweigh the challenges.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
