    "horoscope": "Take someone special to dinner tonight, or invite your friends out for an evening of dancing. The only requirement is lights, laughter and good times. Of course, with your high energy, that shouldn't be hard to find! Even if you can't head out for fun, you can still express your fiery, spicy side. Flirt a little. Smile at a stranger on the street. Have a good time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
