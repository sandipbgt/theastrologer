    "horoscope": "Your best approach to work and relationships today is a cautious one. That may not be easy for you -- 'impulsive' could be your middle name! But staying calm is important now. It's all too easy to get worked up today, taking careless comments or actions too seriously. If something upsetting happens, try not to react. Wait a day or two. Your perspective will almost certainly shift by then.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
