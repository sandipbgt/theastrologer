You're an independent person, but this is no time to isolate yourself from others, whether by adopting an unpopular stance or by purposely going off on your own. Consider it a personal challenge to find a mutually satisfying compromise. Honor others' feelings and needs as much as your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
