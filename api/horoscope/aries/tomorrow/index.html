It's probably best to follow your instincts today, and don't do anything rash. After all, you're getting closer to your goal by the minute, and it would be a shame to mess things up now. So play it safe, and gather all the facts before making a move. Don't take out your uncomfortable feelings on other people, though. It's not their fault life seems so uncertain.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
