    "horoscope": "Are you feeling soft today? You're certainly more emotional than usual, and perhaps vulnerable, too. You might crave the company of someone you love. If you don't want to be alone right now, find a friend to spend the day with you, or give someone a call. But being on your own isn't so bad. Naps, reading and listening to music are all soothing ways to enjoy your own company today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
