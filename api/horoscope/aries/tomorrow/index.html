    "horoscope": "Your mood is jovial, your comments are apt, and you're in touch with your own highest principles. Somehow, the world seems to be in sharper focus than usual. Today is for honing your skills and using them for something important. It's tempting to sit back and enjoy this energy, but you should put it to some good use. It would be a shame to waste this ideal moment on fleeting pleasures, instead of taking this opportunity to put something in motion that will be of benefit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
