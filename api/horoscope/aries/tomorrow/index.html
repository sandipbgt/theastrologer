    "horoscope": "You're very assertive today, filled with a sense of your own power. That, plus your high spirits, could make for a fun, exciting day -- but it could also make for some interesting interactions with friends and coworkers. When you're in this mood, it's easy to step on others' toes without realizing you've done so. Find a way to be your true, honest self while still making room for other people's needs and opinions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
