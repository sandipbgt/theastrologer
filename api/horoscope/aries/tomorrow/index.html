    "horoscope": "Nobody understands you. No one cuts you any slack. Therefore, you don't need them. Hey, wait just a minute. You have some nerve keeping loved ones at a distance. They want to help you with your problems and share their happiness with you. Are you trying to break their hearts? Of course not. You probably just didn't realize how difficult you were being. Hello, you're being difficult. You can change that ASAP. Open your door and arms today. It's the best apology you can offer, and it's the one they'll accept without question.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
