    "horoscope": "This could be a challenging day, even if it's bright and sunny outside. You're easily irritated now, so do things to release tension before difficult moments arise. Get a good sleep, go for a walk or a jog, or turn on loud music and sing in the car on your way to work. Anything you can do to blow off steam will help you through this brief, moody period.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
