    "horoscope": "Do your best today not to let an irritable mood get the better of you. Try to get along with your friends and family. Focus on being content from the inside out. That way, you won't spoil the good feelings surrounding you with rude or domineering behavior. Of course, being insincere won't work, either -- your loved ones know you too well for that! So think of one thing you're genuinely happy about. That's a good start.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
