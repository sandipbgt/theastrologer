    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if you feel a little spaced out today. No matter how much you try to concentrate, your focus just isn't there right now. Instead, your mind wanders. You might be dreaming of a person or event from your past, or one purely of your own imagining. Maybe you can find the fun in exploring your creative side. A certain vision might even lead to a great work of art.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
