    "horoscope": "Hey, what's that strange sound? Stay alert and ready to pounce. Keep all moving parts well oiled and properly adjusted, no matter what kind of machine you're operating. Recognize an opportunity before anyone else even gets a whiff of the money or luck that just entered the room. Then shape yourself to fit that opportunity, so it looks as if you were born for it. The instant you tap into your excitement, you'll see that it's already paying off. In fact, today could even be the start of your next winning streak.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
