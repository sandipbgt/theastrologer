    "horoscope": "Slow down today. Pushing ahead at your usual hectic pace will only lead to confusion and running around in circles. But if you take it easy, things will roll along at their own pace. And truthfully, isn't it nice to get a little break? Life can be so demanding. Today is perfect for relaxing with a good book. Or get absorbed in music or an engaging film. Let your mind wander.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
