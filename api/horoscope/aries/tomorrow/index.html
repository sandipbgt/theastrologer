    "horoscope": "Affable sweetness flows through your veins,, softening your edges and influencing you to calm down for once. Connect with the most special people in your life -- your love endures, and you aren't afraid of anything. They'll be surprised and pleased at your good humor. This'll be an easy time -- maybe next week you won't be quite so noble or relaxed, and you know what that means. Enjoy this mellow feeling while it's here, and make the most of it That way, you won't miss it when it's gone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
