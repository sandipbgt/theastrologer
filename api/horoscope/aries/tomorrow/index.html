    "horoscope": "Having to work long, hard hours today puts you in a solitary mood. You're short with friends and family, and they may even think you're brooding. Your instinct is to let them think what they will. But try to be civil, even if you're feeling pressured. You never know when you may need someone's help, and it will be more forthcoming if they feel you've been treating them well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
