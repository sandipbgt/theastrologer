    "horoscope": "Access your polite side today. You know exactly how to behave in mixed company, even if you don't always follow the rules of good manners. Right now, though, first impressions are everything -- and so are the impressions you make on people you've known for years. Most folks are looking for peace and kindness. Causing a stir of any kind just isn't favored. So relax, take a deep breath and smile.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
