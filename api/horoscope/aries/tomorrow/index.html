    "horoscope": "Today, you're a stickler for details. You have a very clear idea of how you want things to happen, and anyone who disagrees is just an obstacle. But try not to get so angry at people who don't exactly follow your plans. For one thing, they're not mind-readers -- they won't know what you're thinking unless you tell them. They might be feeling more creative than you, which can take a project to a new level. Don't worry -- experimenting with different possibilities won't wreck anything. Try to loosen up a little.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
