    "horoscope": "Do your best to be reasonable today when you're dealing with other people. Don't let minor annoyances, upsetting events or generally tense situations destroy your equanimity. It's a good idea now to access your charm instead of giving in to competitive or aggressive urges. After all, we're all in this together, right? That kind of inclusive attitude will help you get through the day with your dignity intact.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
