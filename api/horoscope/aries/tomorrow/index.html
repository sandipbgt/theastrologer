    "horoscope": "Instead of bossing everyone around today and putting them in their places with sarcasm, try to stop and face your own emotions. You're a bit on the domineering side,. That's what comes with being a natural leader. But you're taking it a little over the edge at the moment. If you slow down and consider what's going on inside your head and your heart, you'll find you're actually feeling very uneasy. Try to get back in touch with the reasons why you do what you do, and see if it's time to change anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
