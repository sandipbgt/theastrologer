You're certainly keeping your friends and coworkers laughing with your antics! Needless to say, you may not get too much accomplished if you're talking and joking all day. But if your current goals involve networking and getting people in your corner, then you'll be successful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
