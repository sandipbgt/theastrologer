    "horoscope": "It's good to follow your instincts today -- within reason. You'll put your impulsive nature to good use. You're full of energy, and you want to work closely with other people toward a common goal. Whoever you share that goal with, don't forget that in the long term, it's important to be consistent. Today isn't about scattering your efforts in severalat once -- it's about focusing your energy toward a positive end. Taking care of business is as important as ever.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
