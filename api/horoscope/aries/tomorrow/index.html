    "horoscope": "You have no trouble being upfront with people, but for today, be kind to them as well. Remember, you're in this together with everyone else -- friends, coworkers and strangers alike. Try to see things from another point of view; maybe it'll help you drum up a little compassion or understanding for the other guy. This may come as a shock to you, but you don't always deserve to have your way! Since you're here to make peace, not trouble, do your best now to get along with everyone you encounter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
