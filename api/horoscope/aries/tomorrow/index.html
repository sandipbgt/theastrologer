    "horoscope": "Some things today seem like a big deal. Maybe you're taking things too personally, or maybe you really do have some drama to contend with. Either way, try to be the eye of the storm. That means stay calm, no matter what. Be direct and keep everything polite and aboveboard. This may not be the fastest way to get what you want, but it's the most effective. You'll be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
