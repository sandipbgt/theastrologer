    "horoscope": "Instead of being consciously aware of your current situation and your honest feelings about it, you're acting out of habit and instinct. But any habitual responses on your part should be sharply inspected today. You'll probably find you've done or said something you wish you hadn't. If so, don't waste time feeling guilty. Everyone makes mistakes. Just make amends. Challenge the status quo and find a better way of being.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
