You're headstrong when it comes to doing your own thing in your own way. That attitude could lead to conflict today, especially if someone important instructs you to do something a certain way. Access your maturity and remind yourself of the importance of choosing your battles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
