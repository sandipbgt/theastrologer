    "horoscope": "You think that sticking to the rules gives you bragging rights, which is unusual for you. Normally, you're all about challenging the status quo. But today you're following the rules and lording it over anyone who's not as together as you are. Being nitpicky might not be the most important thing right now,. Your perfectionist tendencies could actually lead to anxiety, poor sleep and other health issues. Take it easy on yourself, and focus on what's actually important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
