    "horoscope": "Life slows down and gets simple today. You're relaxed and easygoing -- which could be quite a change from your usual amped-up lifestyle! Sometimes it's nice to get some downtime. It's a good day for sharing a meal or a conversation with a good friend. Many people are in the mood to connect in a natural, mellow way. Take advantage of this slow-paced vibe, since it won't last for long.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
