Blasting through the barrier might work, but a little finesse could work even better. Especially if other people are involved, do your best to compromise rather than demanding your due. Make a good-faith effort to get along. Take others' needs and feelings into account as you push ahead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
