    "horoscope": "Do your best to be a lover, not a fighter. It's important to find ways to compromise with your friends and partners today, instead of pushing to get your way or even causing a scene. Harmony in your relationships is something worth striving for, even if it's not normally something you give a lot of thought to. So put down your boxing gloves, Aries. It's time to seek common ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
