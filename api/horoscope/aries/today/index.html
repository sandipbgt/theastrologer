    "horoscope": "You're emotionally involved today. That could lead to some enjoyably intense experiences, but it could also lead to tough moments. Your mood is likely to be up and down, and you're a bit thin-skinned. Other people are sensitive, too. Spending time with a friend could lead to hurt feelings on both sides, but spending time alone could seem very lonely! Try not to take anything too seriously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
