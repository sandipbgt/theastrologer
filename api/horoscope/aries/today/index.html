    "horoscope": "If you find yourself tempted to indulge in some comfort food or a nap today, go ahead. You tend to follow your impulses, anyway, and at the moment, they're telling you to enjoy yourself in a sensory way. So go ahead and satisfy your appetite, as long as the food is wholesome and tasty. With your high energy, you'll have no trouble working it off when life speeds up once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
