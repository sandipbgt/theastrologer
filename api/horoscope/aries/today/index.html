    "horoscope": "You've always been strong-willed, but today you're incredibly determined! It doesn't hurt that your energy is plentiful, your spirits are high and you're in your element. You can reach any goal you set for yourself, by sheer force of will. So make sure it's a worthy goal. That means doing at least a little bit of planning, instead of chasing after the first thing that happens to look appealing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
