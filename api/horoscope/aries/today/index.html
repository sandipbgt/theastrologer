    "horoscope": "Normally you don't really care what other people think of you; in fact, it doesn't usually even cross your mind. But suddenly, you're nervous about the impression you're making, and you want reassurance that people like and admire you. Well, of course they do. You have many friends and admirers -- too many to count. But occasionally worrying about making a good impression is a good thing. It means you care.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
