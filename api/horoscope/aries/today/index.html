    "horoscope": "Your ambitious side flares today. You want to be the best at something. Most of all, you want your excellence to be recognized! But while this go-for-it attitude is appropriate in certain arenas -- being proactive at work, for example, or aggressive on the basketball court -- it may not go over so well among friends and family. Be kind to people. Don't argue just to prove a point.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
