    "horoscope": "Having to work slowly and carefully or make detailed plans might annoy you, but that's what's required of you today. Unfortunately, that means no impulsive moves, and no spontaneously following your urges and passions. Instead, spend the day running errands or focusing on a project at work. Remember, 'good enough' won't fly now. It's important to pay attention to even minor details, and make sure you haven't cut any corners.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
