    "horoscope": "You'll be a little louder and more spontaneous than usual today. For once, that's okay. No one minds, because your influence is exciting them, too. But maybe there's a way you could tap into this zesty collective energy, and make something meaningful happen for everyone. How about a group project? You should be the leader, of course. Everyone's already looking to you for direction, and you're the only one able to project your voice above the din.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
