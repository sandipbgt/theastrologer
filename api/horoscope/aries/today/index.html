    "horoscope": "Connecting with people is easy today, because your energy is strong and you're feeling even bolder than usual. You'll have a very good day of reaching out and touching. In fact, this brief period could even mark the start of an important new relationship. Take pride in your ability to connect with others, as well as to initiate fresh projects. These are great ways to launch something new and exciting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
