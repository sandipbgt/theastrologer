    "horoscope": "You have the courage and energy you need to act on big ideas. And today, those big ideas come in droves, especially in group settings, where people can inspire each other to greater heights of creativity. Generate some ideas, and then serve as leader or instigator -- the person who motivates everyone else to action. That's one of your strengths,. People see your vigorous spirit, and they get inspired.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
