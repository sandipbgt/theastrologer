    "horoscope": "You're passionate in general, but that raw energy is up today. And it's up to you do something positive with it. But that could be a tall order -- maybe an old insult still burns. You know you need to let it go, but right now that seems impossible -- and you may not want to. Still, fight the impulse to showcase with some daredevil stunt. Put your passion into your work or an exciting evening with someone special. Try to forget about the small stuff that just doesn't matter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
