    "horoscope": "Usually you're open to new ideas and maverick approaches, but now you're tough-minded about your own agenda. Today you're a little, well, uptight, which isn't like you. That doesn't prevent you from making cutting remarks that hurt others' feelings. You also have no problem cutting corners in your endeavors. But a frugal, critical approach may not the best one either. You'll have to watch out for others' occasional sensitivity, because you're coming on strong and sharp, closed off to anyone's ideas but your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
