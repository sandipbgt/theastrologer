    "horoscope": "Your usual approach to most issues in your life is to jump right in and tackle it. Lack of forethought or consideration for pacing yourself won't work today. Exercise your will when appropriate, but be cautious. Your employer or creditors might be measuring your abilities. Since fine motor skills really count now, you may have to work against your own instincts and plan ahead. It's a good thing you're naturally wily and ingenious. If anyone can make this challenge work to their advantage, you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
