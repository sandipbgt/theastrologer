    "horoscope": "Today is your day. You're in your element. Your spirits are high. In fact, you're absolutely irrepressible. Make the most of this energy. Set a project in motion, or make an impression. Just be a little bit cautious about what kind of impression that is. If you aren't careful, you might speak out of turn or act impulsively -- and that would spur a different perception than the one you're going for!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
