    "horoscope": "Today, you adore being the center of attention. And the spotlight has a way of finding you. In a group, you're extra boisterous. Sure, this might put a few people off -- but if they can't handle the heat, they should just get out of the kitchen! Your friends recognize that you're a force of nature, as elementally powerful as a fire or a tornado. That's what makes you so exciting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
