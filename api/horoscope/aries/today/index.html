    "horoscope": "It may be challenging to strike a compromise today, but that's just the spirit you should go for. You prefer to be the leader, but sometimes it's better to demonstrate that you're one of the team. You might have to 'fake it till you make it.' But you can do it! Smile, nod and cooperate. This reduces tension for everyone, and makes them more open to following your lead in the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
