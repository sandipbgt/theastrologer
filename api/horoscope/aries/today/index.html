Wherever they got that idea, it's wrong. Demonstrate your affection ASAP. Reclaim your place in their hearts today, planting your flag and driving out anyone who gives you bad publicity. You've been away for too long, and now you have to show some love. The deeper you get, the more you'll like what happens to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
