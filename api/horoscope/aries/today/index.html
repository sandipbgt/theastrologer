Instead, switch into brainstorming mode, and don't confuse it with being put on hold. It's not the same at all. You're just calming yourself, gathering your energy for the next phase of things, which is really just two days away at most. There's plenty to do in the moment, and if you play it right, it won't feel anything like waiting around for the next big step.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
