    "horoscope": "Today, seek out like-minded people who are interested in the same things you are. Choose a goal, and then pursue it! This could be any type of project -- even just playing a game online with friends. But projects geared toward helping others gain the most mileage right now. Life isn't just about the mindless pursuit of pleasure. With your energy, you can really make a difference.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
