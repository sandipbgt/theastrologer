    "horoscope": "Watch for defensive or controlling behavior today. You may feel cranky due to increased responsibilities at work or at home. Your burden feels heavy, in part because your energy isn't as high as you're used to. But being short with a coworker or your spouse won't help the situation, and in fact will contribute to the tension. It's a good day for solo work, if possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
