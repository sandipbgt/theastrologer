If you have serious work to tackle, it goes well -- humor always lightens up even the most tedious tasks. And if you have to do something that requires courage, it's no problem. You feel strong, capable and fearless. You're truly capable of anything you set your mind to now, and so go for it,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
