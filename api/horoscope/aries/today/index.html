That's what today is all about -- taking advantage of the mellow energy that's currently flowing through you. Take this opportunity to relax. Or maybe there's some work you need to catch up on. Focus your energies and accept this temporary stability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
