    "horoscope": "You can think progressively even as you stay consistent with your principles. Today should be all about fearless exploration of new territory, including the territory of the mind. Your ideals are ready for revamping, and you'll be able to extend them even further with just a little more effort. And then, the world will truly be your oyster. With such a firm code of ethics in place, you can accomplish just about anything, because your sense of daring is at an all-time high. Get out there and make it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
