    "horoscope": "If you're in a leadership position at work or among your friends, you can motivate your team to accomplish quite a lot today. Focus on communicating in an open-minded, tolerant way. People respond much better now to an even-tempered, warm approach than to a bossy or critical one. It's all about how you relate to people. An honest and direct, yet gentle approach is best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
