    "horoscope": "You'll learn a lot today if you make an effort to blend in with the crowd. This goes totally against your nature: You're all about being yourself, no matter the consequences. But cooperating with other people teaches you what they want, what they need and what makes them tick. A big part of this, of course, is being a good listener. You're used to commanding the conversation, but in work situations or with friends, try to give others the stage. That will enable you to work together instead of at cross purposes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
