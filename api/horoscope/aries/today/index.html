This might mean conserving resources like time or money, instead of assuming you have plenty and then, halfway through a project, realizing you've run out. It also probably means staying disciplined. Keep your efforts simple and focused. Emphasize workable plans over experimental ideas. At the moment, basic reality is what matters most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
