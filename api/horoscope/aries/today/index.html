    "horoscope": "Keep paying attention to details today, even minor ones that don't seem important. It's those little bits of information that could end up tripping you up later, if you aren't careful. And don't worry -- this brief period of focus and caution is almost over. Soon, you can return to your usual bold ways. For now, though, make plans with care, and be thorough in your work. You'd hate to have to redo something later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
