    "horoscope": "Your energy mellows out today. Instead of that restlessness that usually fuels your inner, you feel a little more relaxed. It's easier now to be reliable for your family or your boss. In fact, it's a great day for doing some hard work that requires focus. You're less likely than usual to get fed up with it. Endurance mixes with your usual high energy to produce excellent results.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
