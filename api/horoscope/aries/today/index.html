    "horoscope": "Your normal all-out energy has mellowed, and things will move at a slower pace for a bit. Today, you're the embodiment of good humor. It's a great time to contemplate and make plans. You're unaffected by fame and fortune, which means you can make some good decisions now - ones based on nothing but the actual state of  your life and the values you hold dear. This is a good thing -- you've owed the world a demonstration on how to be nice for a while now. It's about time you paid up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
