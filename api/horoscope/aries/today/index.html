    "horoscope": "Make an effort to speak calmly today, especially in conversations about touchy subjects. Your energy is especially high, and you're feeling worked up and suspicious of other people's motives. It's easy to read into things they say and do, but don't assume you're seeing them clearly. On days like this, it's always best to err on the side of kindness, forgiveness and turning the other cheek, even if the warrior within you wants to charge!"
