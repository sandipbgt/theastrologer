    "horoscope": "Make a conscious effort to soften up today. There's a hard energy at work right now, and it's making your own edges a bit sharp. But everyone, including your coworkers, family and others, responds better to a more humorous or lighthearted approach. Instead of telling people what to do in a brusque, businesslike way, ask politely for their cooperation and input. Common courtesy encourages their engagement. And that's just what you want!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
