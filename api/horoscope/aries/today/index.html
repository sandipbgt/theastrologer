In other words, you could get involved, meet people, and have as much fun as you can stand. Yes, adventure is out there waiting if you're ready to board that plane. See who else wants to play, unless you're flying solo. It might not be much of a party that way, but if your private life is rich enough, you won't need to socialize right now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
