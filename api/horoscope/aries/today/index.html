Familiar surroundings are a real comfort at the moment. Besides that, home is the place where people know you best. Your loved ones won't take you too seriously if you're in a mood. They know your irritation might flare, but it burns out fast.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
