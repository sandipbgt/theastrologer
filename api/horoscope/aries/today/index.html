    "horoscope": "It looks like all green lights for today. Go ahead and have that adventure you're craving. You'll find yourself getting away with a lot more than usual, and the best part is that you won't be alone. You'll be inspiring others every step of the way.  Try to be a good influence instead of just leading them down the garden path. By showing the will power to do things right, you'll inspire yourself, too. That might be the biggest plus of all. Consider your new visions for this month. Maybe even make a new, meaningful to-do list.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
