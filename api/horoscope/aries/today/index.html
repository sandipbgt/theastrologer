If you feel insulted, you might lash out first and ask questions later. But it would be so much better to take a deep breath and give the other person the benefit of the doubt. Talk about what happened instead of tossing your own insults into the ring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
