    "horoscope": "You're swimming upstream today, against the main flow of traffic. This could be a good thing -- a testament to your maverick nature -- but then again, it could be a waste of effort. Cool your heels and chill out a bit. The moment isn't right for action or rebellion, so hang out on the sidelines for now and conserve energy.
