    "horoscope": "Lust makes you uneasy. Maybe it's been a while, or maybe it's about someone new. But should you even be thinking these thoughts? What if your true intentions slip out? You could be a little late with those questions if someone is already on your wavelength, picking up the signals you're sending. Expect a red or green light today. Then you'll know for sure. If it's a red light, don't sulk. If it's a green light, hiding your delicious new secret from the world might be a lot easier.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
