    "horoscope": "You've been raging against the machine for such a long time that you've forgotten what started this frenzied battle -- and yet, the end is in sight. It's not that you've won, it's that you're tempted to give up. You're tired and discouraged. How can you prevail against such difficult odds? And yet, you aren't quite ready for graceful surrender. Clearly, your opponents have no idea what you're made of, Aries.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
