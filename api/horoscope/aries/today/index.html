    "horoscope": "There's no need for any pretense today, because your natural composure is utterly unruffled. You don't even need company, unless you want it, since you already have the pleasure of your own. This might be the perfect day to work quietly on a project you already have underway. As dull as that may sound, today's energy lends itself to taking care of business, especially if it involves getting your finances in order. Some savvy maneuvering could reveal a lucrative opportunity. Stay open to good tips, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
