You'll probably react against rigid expectations from others, such as having to tackle a project in a particular way. But you're extra creative now, so you can come up with ingenious ways of getting around these restrictions and finding the freedom you crave.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
