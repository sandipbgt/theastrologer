    "horoscope": "A sense of joy bubbles through you, and excitement makes you fluid and agile. You're primed and ready to say and do all the right things today. You can really make things happen now, so connect with the right VIPs, and be sure to make your actions matter. Consider -- what do you want to accomplish? Don't be selfish in your efforts, either: This period is all about broad strokes that benefit everyone. It's perfectly appropriate to enjoy your luck, but don't build on it. Instead, build on genuine drive and effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
