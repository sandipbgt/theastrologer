    "horoscope": "Your ambitious streak runs strong within you today. Your ample drive and determination count for a lot. But your usual full-steam-ahead approach isn't the best one for the current influence. Adopt a more cautious, shrewd perspective instead. Yes, this might mean you can't have that instant gratification that feeds your high energy! But a bit of planning is worth it if it ensures that you reach a meaningful goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
