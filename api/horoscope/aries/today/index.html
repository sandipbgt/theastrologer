    "horoscope": "Tension, restlessness and nerves could get the better of you today, if you let them. Just remember that you don't have to give in to gloomy, discouraged thoughts. With some careful focus, you could even harness this tricky energy to get something accomplished. Be sure to hit the gym or the trail, even just for a short, quick workout. Working up a sweat will help you keep your temper under control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
