    "horoscope": "It's hard for you to take direction from others. You are your own boss, after all -- at least, you wish you were! You're headstrong when it comes to doing your own thing in your own way. That attitude could lead to conflict today, especially if someone important instructs you to do something a certain way. Access your maturity and remind yourself of the importance of choosing your battles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
