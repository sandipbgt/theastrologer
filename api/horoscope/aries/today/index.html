    "horoscope": "Your curiosity abounds today. You're heedless of limits and boundaries that might normally hold you back, whether in a literal or a figurative way. If you travel someplace new, for example, your sense of adventure will have you sneaking behind gates or doors where you really shouldn't be. Or in conversation, you might push boundaries by straying into taboo or overly personal territory. Good thing your brash personality can carry you through tight spots!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
