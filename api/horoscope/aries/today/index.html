There's something about rubbing shoulders with other people that just feels good right now. And even though you're part of a group, you're bound to find a way to make your own, distinctive mark. You're too creative not to! Expect incredible results from joining your own ideas with others'.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
