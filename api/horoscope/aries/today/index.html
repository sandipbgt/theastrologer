    "horoscope": "You're a true maverick. That's part of your charm -- your warrior heart, your willingness to fight for what you believe. But today, doing your own thing regardless of what others think doesn't go over well. You could seem like a rebel without a clue! This is all about perfecting that balance between self and others. Assert yourself when necessary, but also, learn the gentle art of give and take.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
