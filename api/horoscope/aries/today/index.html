    "horoscope": "Your usually high energy is a little toned down today. You might find yourself needing a nap, or staring out the window when you're supposed to be focused on your work. It's hard to concentrate under the current influence! So let your mind wander. Get some extra rest when you need it. Power down for a day or two. Then you can come back full-force.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
