But remember that song about the tears of a clown? These crazy, kooky acts are, after all, just an act. You're not really feeling what you seem to feel. Watch others today. See if you should continue entertaining them. If not, there are truer ways of amusing yourself. A short retirement from the public eye might be good for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
