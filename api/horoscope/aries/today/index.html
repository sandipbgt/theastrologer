    "horoscope": "Your creativity runs high today, and you're in the mood to spend time with other people. You pride yourself on your assertive energy and strong opinions, and indeed, those are the very qualities that attract other people to you. But pose your opinions tactfully today, and be respectful of others' points of view, too. This will really endear you to people and help you gain their support and their friendship.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
