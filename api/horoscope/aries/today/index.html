    "horoscope": "You're like a sudden ray of sunshine blasting apart the clouds. After a big entrance like that, you'll have to keep on shining today. There's no other choice. You're cheerful and fun loving because you have nothing to hide. Your chickens have come home to roost. Your skeletons came out of the closet, stretched their old bones and shambled away. Life would be so easy if things were always this laid-back. It'll never happen, of course, but as long as you know the value of this perfect moment, you can bring it with you wherever you go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
