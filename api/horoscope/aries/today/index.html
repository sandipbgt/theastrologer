They'd do well to listen to your perspective on the matter, because for you, it's more than just an intellectual game. You want to do what's right, and since you're well-aligned at the moment, you're sure to figure out the answer. Keep up this thought process, and you'll have to prepare for success -- and lots of admiration from your peers.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
