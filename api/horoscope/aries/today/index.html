    "horoscope": "Your feelings take center stage. Normally you might not pay much attention to your emotions from one moment to the next, but now it's as if you can't help but dwell on how you're feeling! Things might affect you more deeply than usual now. Heartwarming experiences bring tears to your eyes -- and so do more poignant, bittersweet events. Just let these feelings wash through you. Soon you'll feel more like yourself again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
