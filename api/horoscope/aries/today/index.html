There are parties to be thrown, attended and crashed, there are friends to laugh with and new people to meet -- there are just so many possibilities! Have a great time today and this evening, but be sure to use your head if you go out on the town. It's a good thing that's easier now than usual. Be smart while you're having fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
