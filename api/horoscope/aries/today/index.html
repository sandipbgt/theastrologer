    "horoscope": "Strong energy and high spirits combine for an interesting and enjoyable day. You're feeling extra independent, but if you spend time alone, do so for the purpose of pursuing a hobby or subject of particular interest. Your mind is keen and you're absorbing new concepts like a sponge soaks up. Spending time with friends is good, too. New acquaintances engage your interest. You could make a real meeting of the minds!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
