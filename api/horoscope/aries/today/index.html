    "horoscope": "You've always got energy to burn, but today isn't about pushing toward your personal goals. It's about working with other people toward something you all want. So cool your jets for a bit, and focus on pleasing someone other than yourself. Whoever it is, don't be confused -- this isn't about being a servant. There are direct benefits for you -- ones that can only be discovered by doing. So find out what everyone needs, and see what you can do to make it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
