    "horoscope": "They can't wait to listen to your story, buy whatever you're selling or get their hands on you. How long have you been waiting for this? How much do you want to see them beg? Yes, you're holding the world in the palm of your hand, but try to be cool even when you're clearly just so hot. Adapt your wild energy to whatever the moment demands so that you're always one step ahead of ready. You'll score big points today, because you'll be the guest of honor at every celebration. Don't you just love being loved?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
