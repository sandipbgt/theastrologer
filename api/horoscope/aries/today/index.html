    "horoscope": "Today your energy is revving like a motorcycle engine, raring to go. You're full of feeling and passion. And since right now you can be impulsive about expressing strong emotions, you'll need to channel these feelings in a careful, conscious way. Don't snap at your spouse or a coworker, and avoid any type of manipulative behavior. Instead, talk things out with someone you trust. This will free up deeper levels of energy within you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
