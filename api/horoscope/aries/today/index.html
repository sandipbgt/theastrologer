    "horoscope": "You might feel a little blue today, or perhaps you're just in a sentimental mood. Either way, it's a good day to connect with someone you love, whether that means calling up your best friend long-distance or poring over old photographs and recalling memories of family members who are long gone. It's good to explore your feelings,. It teaches you about who you are inside.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
