    "horoscope": "You have a yen for freedom today. It's like a sharp scent on the breeze, or a compelling song playing in your head -- something you just have to follow until you can track it down! Today should definitely be about casual, carefree fun, if at all possible. Of course, the demands of your job or relationship could get in the way of that, but do be as adventurous as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
