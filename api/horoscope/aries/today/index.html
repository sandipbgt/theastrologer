    "horoscope": "Life was OK inside the bubble, but it just popped open like a cocoon, and now you're a social butterfly. Suddenly you're others-oriented. You like them, they like you, and you really care about what they think. Throw money and effort into the mix. Break out the cash. Break a sweat. See what you can buy or whether you can force things a little closer to ideal. You're sure to see big results today. Of course you want it all to come out for the best, but be ready to share the blame along with the credit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
