    "horoscope": "You're in touch with your introspective side, but not in a moody or downhearted way. No, you're actually feeling quite aware, in tune with the world and excited about the possibilities that today brings. Take a look inside your heart, and you'll see that you know just what to do during this charmed period. Remember, you're as timely and adroit as ever, and multitasking is a particular skill now. Use it well: Focus on a project or goal that really means something to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
