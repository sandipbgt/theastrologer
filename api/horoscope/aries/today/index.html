    "horoscope": "Partnerships are highlighted today. You're an independent person, but the current influence urges you to do your best to get along with others. It's especially important to make it clear to your spouse or business partner that you're open to teamwork and compromise. This may mean biting your tongue instead of speaking out, but that's a good skill to develop. This is about learning to choose your battles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
