    "horoscope": "Watch your tendency to react without thinking today. You're passionate by nature, and sometimes have a short temper. The current influence is a deeply emotional one. If someone hurts your feelings, you're likely to react quickly, before you've really considered the situation. Later, you might realize you overreacted -- but by then, it's too late. Avoid this before it occurs by consciously staying calm. Give people the benefit of the doubt.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
