    "horoscope": "It's important today to be on your best behavior, especially in the company of new friends or business associates. You're all about honesty, and you tend to react without thinking. But right now it's savvy to consider your words before you speak, so you don't step on anyone's toes! You wouldn't do so on purpose, of course. But it's better just to avoid it from the start. Be your charming self.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
