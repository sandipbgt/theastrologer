    "horoscope": "Use your natural energy to bring people together today and get a project going. It's easy for you to hustle up some action, and during this brief period, you're better at it than anyone. You know what you want and you're open to working with someone else -- a friend, a professional contact -- to make it happen. Remember, this isn't a time to go it alone. Listen to others' opinions as well as expressing your own. And don't worry about operating under the wrong assumptions. At least you're making creative guesses, and your efforts can bring people together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
