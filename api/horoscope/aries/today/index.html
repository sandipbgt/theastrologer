    "horoscope": "Assert yourself, by all means, but don't ruin everything by doing so. Push your agenda constructively. Only crash the parties where you know you'll be welcome. Today will be great if you know enough to hold off when people don't need you. Even the perfect energy at the wrong time could mess things up. While you're absolutely entitled to strut through your world free and unafraid, you also have a duty to be appropriate. Why not start the next month off on the right foot? When people like your attitude and style, they'll be more willing to support you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
