    "horoscope": "You're used to impulsive, exhaustive approaches to projects and problems. If you try to exert that kind of energy today, you'll feel held back. Your best bet is to work with this influence instead of against it. Be a cautious warrior instead of an all-out berserker. Make a plan, even though you'd rather act than think. Don't forget the help your friends and allies can give you if you ask for it. Remember, there's nothing fainthearted about talking things out and gathering good ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
