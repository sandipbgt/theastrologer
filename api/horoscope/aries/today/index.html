    "horoscope": "Your energy is amplified today. Your mind and mouth are both running a mile a minute. Be careful what you say and how you say it. It's easy to speak impulsively, and being tactful isn't necessarily your forte on the best of days! Being clever and funny, on the other hand, is one of your strengths. Rely on your quick wit to get you out of any rough spots that may develop.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
