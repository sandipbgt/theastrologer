    "horoscope": "Feel first, think later -- that might be your motto. You're no stranger to intense emotional ups and downs, and wrong or right, your convictions have always been strong. They'll be doubly so today, when your various passions could easily turn to anger, or worse. Keep yourself firmly under control, especially when you need to maintain friendly connections with others. Your loved ones know you can be hot under the collar. That doesn't mean you should behave recklessly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
