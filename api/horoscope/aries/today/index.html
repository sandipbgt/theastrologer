    "horoscope": "Be kind to yourself and others today. Kindness toward yourself might mean taking a nap when you're feeling tired, instead of pushing yourself to keep going. It's definitely a good day to take it easy. Kindness toward others might mean lending an ear to a friend, or nurturing your family with a home-cooked meal. This kind of activity is personally fulfilling, and will help you regain your energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
