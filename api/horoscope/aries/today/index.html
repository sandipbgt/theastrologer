    "horoscope": "Be subtle today. Quietly sparkle in those moments when you don't actually need to shine. Because, why wear out the batteries? It's not self-canceling to conserve your energy while staying active. Objects in motion have different properties than objects at rest, and anyway, to the right people, your actions will speak louder than words. That means you can forget the subtitles, super titles, tickers and close captioning. You'll be obvious enough to those lucky few already on your wavelength. It's OK to make it a private party every so often.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
