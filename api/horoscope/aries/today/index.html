    "horoscope": "You're dominating the conversation today. You have a lot of ideas, and you really want people to listen and know how serious you are about setting your plans in motion. It's good to communicate passionately, but keep breathing, too. Someone else might say something useful, or produce an idea that will make your strategy even better. If they offer criticism, take it in stride. They're trying to help, and you could use the quality control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
