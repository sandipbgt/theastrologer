    "horoscope": "Your emotions might get the better of you today, pushing you to act out angry or jealous feelings instead of taking a step back and trying to reason with yourself. But you don't have to let that happen. Resist outbursts and other reckless impulses. Seek a compassionate perspective. Recognize that someone who seems aloof or hurts your feelings probably has their own issues to deal with.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
