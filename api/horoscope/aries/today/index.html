    "horoscope": "You love to argue, especially today, but here are a few rules to keep in mind if you want to win: Keep your argument brief. Use short words that everyone understands. And stick to solid facts. These simple steps go a long way toward convincing people you know what you're talking about. Now, today is ideal for speculation, but don't expect to prove anything concrete -- yet. Hey, at least you have everyone's attention!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
