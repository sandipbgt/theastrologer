    "horoscope": "Your usually high energy may take a dip today. If so, go with it. Try slower-paced activities like reading, watching movies or doing yoga. It's especially important to let your mind wander where it will. Of course, if you're trying to get something accomplished, the lack of concentration could be irritating. Center yourself with a brief nap or meditation. That should help focus your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
