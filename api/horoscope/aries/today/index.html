This means that some everyday source of frustration -- a traffic jam, a tense interaction with a coworker -- could really set you off. Do your best to keep a handle on your ire. Don't snap at people, no matter how sorely you're tempted! Stay calm and kind, and give people the benefit of the doubt as much as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
