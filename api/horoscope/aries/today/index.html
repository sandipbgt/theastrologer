    "horoscope": "Slow down a bit today. Your usual breakneck pace doesn't lend itself to a careful, methodical approach, which is favored now in almost any area of life. You may feel as if someone's expectations of you are too high, but there's an emphasis right now on living up to high standards. Do your best to toe that line, even if you secretly think a more relaxed approach would be just fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
