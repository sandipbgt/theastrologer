They can be important tools to build a better future for yourself, if you will use them that way. Examine how you have handled relationships or business, and identify the weak spots. You have time to decide what has to happen next, so use this today to construct a viable plan of action.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
