    "horoscope": "Your competitive side pushes to the forefront today. You're certainly a force to contend with, whether you're at the office, on the court or simply engaged in conversation. When you're feeling like this -- full of spunk -- it's important to be aware of other people. In certain company, being aggressive is fun and perfectly appropriate. In other settings, it's smart to stay polite, even as you make your move and flatten the competition.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
