    "horoscope": "You're used to working full-throttle -- expending a lot of energy and seeing instant results. But for today, all your vigor and constructive energy won't have any immediate effect. Don't be surprised or dismayed when this happens. These things take time. The current energy is naturally slow-moving and deliberately paced, and you'll just have to deal with it. Be patient. Sense the power build up behind your project. Soon the dam will break, and all your efforts will finally pay off.
