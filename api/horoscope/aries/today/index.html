    "horoscope": "Turn your attention toward other people today. You're in an unusually softhearted mood now. You genuinely want to help someone in need. And with your energy, you can really make a difference. So if an opportunity to be of service presents itself, take it. Helping someone in need is an emotionally fulfilling experience. It also helps you realize how well off you truly are. And that, dear, is priceless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
