    "horoscope": "Other people may seem a bit uptight today. Maybe your boss is insisting on more precision in your work, or your spouse or roommate is being critical about your cleanliness at home. Whoever it is, their criticisms could really get under your skin! But don't let your temper get the best of you. Maybe they're right. Perhaps you could stand to be a little more careful in your efforts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
