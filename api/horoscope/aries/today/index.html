    "horoscope": "You feel like a sleek, fast, well-designed automobile. You can go anywhere and do anything. Ah, the freedom! Best of all, your high energy and good mood make you relaxed and informal with everyone. Whether you're trading jokes with a buddy or discussing an important project with higher-ups, your breezy mood puts everyone at ease. In fact, this is a great time to approach someone in authority with something important you'd like to get underway. Your natural confidence means they'll let you do anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
