But make an effort to go with the flow instead of deliberately causing trouble. In fact, this is a great day for you to demonstrate your natural leadership ability. When issues come up, take charge of the situation and find a creative resolution.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
