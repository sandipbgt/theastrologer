    "horoscope": "You're independent by nature, but that doesn't mean you don't need a little closeness and intimacy with others sometimes. Today is one of those days when you crave company. And you're willing to do just about anything to get it! Obviously, a friendly, accepting approach is a great way to draw people toward you. Brash, crass or noisy behavior, on the other hand, is a good way to push them away. Choose wisely,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
