    "horoscope": "If you notice today that people seem especially quiet or reserved, your initial urge might be to draw them out of their shells by any means necessary. But it may be smarter to model your own behavior after theirs. This is one of those days when focus and hard work are favored, while boisterous behavior and inappropriate jokes aren't. Keep in mind that people are rather easily offended under the current influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
