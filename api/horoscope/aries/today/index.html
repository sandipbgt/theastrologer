    "horoscope": "Life gets mellow today. Don't let that frustrate you! Instead, just go with it. Hang out with your friends. Kick back and enjoy their company. Be a little bit lazy. Food, touch and other sensual pleasures are especially nice right now, so go ahead and indulge in them. When that sense of satisfaction steals over you, you'll forget your irritation that this isn't the most action-packed day you've ever experienced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
