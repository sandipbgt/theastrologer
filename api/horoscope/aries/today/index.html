    "horoscope": "This is the kind of day when everything brings a smile to your lips. This happens whether you're laughing at the world or simply taking pleasure in its beauty and complexity. Yes, you can be sincere and irreverent at the same time. You're viewing the world with a sense of amusement. Things that might normally frustrate you make you laugh.
