Strike out for parts unknown, whether in a literal sense or an intellectual one. If you have to adhere to your agenda, find other ways to push the limits. An outside-the-box approach to a project at work could turn out to be just the ticket.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
