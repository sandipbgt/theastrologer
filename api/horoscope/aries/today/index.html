And if you perceive danger of any kind regarding your family or your future, your inner warrior will come valiantly to the fore. He's likely to fizzle out quickly, though. So do try to stay calm and reasonable. Don't let subjective feelings cloud your logic. It's likely that things aren't nearly as uncertain as they seem.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
