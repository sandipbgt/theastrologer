    "horoscope": "Did you get a cutting-edge new haircut or take your entire wardrobe to be tailored? Something's certainly different. However you're pulling this off, you cut a fine figure today, and people are really taking notice. At parties and at the office, your wit sparkles, and the reviews are glowing. Of course, this is all too good to last.
