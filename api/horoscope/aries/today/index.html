    "horoscope": "You may experience some emotional ups and downs today. Many people are feeling moody under the current influence, and that's the rub. You tend to react to your emotions without thinking, which can make a tense situation even tougher, especially if you've misinterpreted someone's statement or actions. It's better to take a few deep breaths and consider things before you react, but that's harder to do when you're feeling so thin-skinned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
