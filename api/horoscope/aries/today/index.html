    "horoscope": "Make an effort to access your spiritual side today. The current energy makes you more sensitive than usual, in all senses of the word. Your feelings may be stirred up, and it's easy to get your feelings hurt. But it's also easy to tap into subtle vibrations like love or faith. It's important to stay positive now, so you can enjoy the positive side of this influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
