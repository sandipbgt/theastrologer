    "horoscope": "You're a true extrovert today, talking and trading ideas with everyone you meet. People are attracted to your free-spirited personality. To them, you represent the independence everyone wants. You want it, too, perhaps even more than others do. That's why restricting situations and relationships could grate on you now more than ever. But your spirits are high, making it easy to just do your thing regardless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
