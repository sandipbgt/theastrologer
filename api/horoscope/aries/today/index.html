    "horoscope": "Today, pay special attention to how you're coming across to other people. The current influence has most folks feeling more emotionally sensitive than usual. And while you mean no one any harm, your bold, brash way of dealing with people could push someone's buttons. Be careful to respect others' feelings and sensitivities. Go out of your way to play nice. If you're so gentle you feel silly, that just might be soft enough!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
