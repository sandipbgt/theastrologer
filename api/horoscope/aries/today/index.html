    "horoscope": "Your youthful energy bubbles up today. However, the universe is urging you to slow down a little and take stock of your situation. Remember to stay civilized as you mix and mingle with other people, especially if you're rubbing elbows with your employer or potential clients. You want to give them a sense of your raw energy, but you don't want to come across as overly brash or unrefined. This will require fine-tuned social skills. Try to move deliberately through the world instead of behaving impulsively.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
