    "horoscope": "It's easy to get irritable today. Your agenda is filled with busywork, which makes you feel more restricted than you want to be. But it's good to take care of mundane business. Pay those bills, answer those emails and make those critical decisions. You'll feel better once you've managed all the details. Speaking of 'critical,' your eyes and tongue are both a little sharper than usual. Try not to criticize others too much!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
