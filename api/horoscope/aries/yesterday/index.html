    "horoscope": "Toning down your anger doesn't seem like a huge challenge today, but just because you don't express it openly doesn't mean it isn't there. It's just not obvious. Of course, there's still plenty of stewing and brewing going on inside you, and soon you'll feel more open about expressing it. So stay in touch with your feelings, but rather than opening your mouth, open your ears. You don't have to accept everything people say."
