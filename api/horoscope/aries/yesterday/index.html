You may even notice that no one seems to be enforcing any restrictions, but that doesn't mean you should take this thing and run with it. Behave for now. Above all, remember that any deals you make have to be straightforward, aboveboard, and squeaky clean. You'll be glad later, when you receive kudos, or even a financial bonus, as a direct result.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
