    "horoscope": "You're a natural leader, but today your urge to take control is highlighted even more than usual. Especially in important arenas, such as business meetings or a tense moment with your spouse, make an effort not to talk over the other person. Listen respectfully and present your side as calmly as possible. That alone will do more to guarantee your success than anything else you can do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
