Shortcuts may not be an option. So dig deep and find that fighter's spirit that lies within you. Actually, you shouldn't have to dig that deep -- your inner warrior is right on the surface of your personality, ready to access whenever you need it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
