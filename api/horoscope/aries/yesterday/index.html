    "horoscope": "Team efforts are favored today. This could be tough on you, since you're independent by nature. You may prefer to work on your own. It's so much easier than negotiating everything with someone else! And yet, some of the most important work can only be done within a partnership. Just think of your closest relationships, both personal and professional ones. Haven't you grown through them? Keep that in mind today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
