    "horoscope": "All those emotions churning inside you need an outlet -- but lashing out at someone is not the best idea. A much better, more proactive way to contain the flood of feeling that rages within you is also a simple one: Get some exercise. Go jogging. Do some gardening. Aim some kicks at the heavy bag at the gym. Do some pushups. Anything vigorously physical will blunt the edge of the strong emotions that course through you today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
