Both ardor and anger will die down soon enough. Maybe you're trying to win someone's affections, feeling slighted by a friend or worried about some particular situation. Whatever's going on, you're far better off playing it cool than letting your inner Neanderthal run the show.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
