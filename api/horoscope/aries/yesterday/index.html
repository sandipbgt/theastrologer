    "horoscope": "High energy makes you especially attentive and expressive today. Suddenly, you're noticing nuances of wit or language you might ordinarily miss. You always appreciate a good joke, but now you're drawn to sharply intelligent humor. Take in a political satire or a 'mockumentary,' or to read a book or article that challenges your intellect. It's just so enjoyable to revel in ideas now, and explore them past their boundaries.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
