But the path to that goal may not be perfectly clear, and with each obstacle you encounter, you become more agitated. Maybe you should put some thought into exactly what's driving you. Be clear with yourself and others about what you're doing. Know the difference between defense and rebellion. Otherwise, you may find yourself lashing out at anyone and everyone around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
