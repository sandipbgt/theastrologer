    "horoscope": "You might feel nitpicked and criticized today. Someone in a position of authority in your life -- your parents or employer, perhaps -- certainly has high standards! And today they're higher than ever. It seems unfair for them to pick on your performance, and their harsh judgments make you prickly.
