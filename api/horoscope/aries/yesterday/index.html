    "horoscope": "Annoying twinges of insecurity have made you more self-focused than usual. Still, why the indifference to everything that's going on around you? Just because you're worried about the state of your own life doesn't mean you should neglect your friends, family or colleagues. People depend on you for your energy and fiery motivation. So focus on building community today. That's how you'll gather your strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
