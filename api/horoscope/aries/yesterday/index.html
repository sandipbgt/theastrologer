    "horoscope": "Suddenly there's no such thing as later. You want immediate success, and nothing else will do. Today you'll come up with some truly creative ideas about how to snatch that prize from the moment's jaws. Others will stand in awe, maybe because they think you're brilliant or maybe because they're expecting it to end in some kind of epic disaster. Even though you might feel that you're acting the hero, remember that you're living in the real world and playing with real. If consequences truly matter to you this month, you'll stop before going too far.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
