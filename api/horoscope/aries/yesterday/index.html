You feel the need to be radically individual, whether that will mean going against the grain and getting in people's faces or marching off alone to the private soundtrack in your ear buds. Hey, with that attitude, things could get amusing around here today. If you're still having fun with this, maybe you can take it even farther. Just try to stop before you break any laws.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
