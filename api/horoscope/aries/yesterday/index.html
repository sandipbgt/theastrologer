People recognize your creative energy and your natural passion, which means they're going to want your input. Don't try to take on too much; be frank with them about what you can and can't handle. That way, you'll have enough focus only for endeavors that you really believe in. Of course, you can take on more now than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
