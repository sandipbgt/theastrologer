And the truth is, while your mind is racing ahead, it's actually hard to get much accomplished in this state of mind. You're too distracted by every bright, shiny, noisy person or idea you encounter. On the other hand, this is a highly creative state, so enjoy it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
