It feels good to throw yourself totally into something you believe in. Just don't fret if you don't see immediate results. They could take some time, since you're just in the building stages. Be sure to moderate your energy output so you don't burn out prematurely.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
