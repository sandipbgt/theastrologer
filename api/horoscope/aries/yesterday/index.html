    "horoscope": "Approach every interaction with other people today in the spirit of compromise. That's the best way to ensure that you've tapped into the current cosmic influence, which emphasizes harmony in relationships. You're such an independent person by nature that you might not think it's important to go out of your way to cooperate. But you'll find that things go much more smoothly if you make that effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
