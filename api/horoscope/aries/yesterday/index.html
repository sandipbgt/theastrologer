But find some way to tap into the playful energy that's currently infusing the world. Yours is the kind of personality that's well suited to following your bliss wherever it might lead you. That impulsive nature of yours could find wonderfully positive expression under the current influence!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
