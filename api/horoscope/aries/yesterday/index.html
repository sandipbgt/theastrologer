    "horoscope": "Do something creative today. Your imagination is especially vibrant now, because your mind and heart are so open. Images and impressions rise to the surface of your consciousness like bubbles. Welcome them! They could spur an incredible work of art or literature. You're also more responsive than usual to music, poetry and artwork. Not artistic? You can enjoy taking in someone else's creation now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
