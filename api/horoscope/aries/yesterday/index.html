    "horoscope": "You're a quick thinker, but your thoughts seem alien. Will anyone get your otherworldly logic? Not today. If you want to get allies in your corner, you'll have to bring your ideas down to. Of course, things will shift and it won't matter, if you all get along. But for now, it does matter. If you're working on a group project, your coworkers want to know you're all on the same page. Similarly, your friends want to know you're still the same person they know and love. Try not to be too extreme in your approach.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
