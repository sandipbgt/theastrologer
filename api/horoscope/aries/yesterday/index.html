If you indulge in childish, obstinate behavior, you'll just be clipping your own wings. Instead, find a different direction for your thoughts. Be creative and positive in how you talk to people today, and tackle your to-do list with energy -- even if you have to fake it at first. Adjust your attitude, and your outlook follows. It works every time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
