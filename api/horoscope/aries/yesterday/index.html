    "horoscope": "It's especially important today not to react too quickly if you feel snubbed or criticized by someone. Instead, practice your ability to give others the benefit of the doubt, and keep the peace. This may be difficult for you. You have the heart of a warrior, after all! But at the moment, harmony and teamwork are favored. Arguments and disagreements just push you and a friend or coworker further apart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
