Life is a game of Follow the Leader, with you in the head position, of course! You love the feeling of charging ahead, blazing a previously uncharted path for everyone who's following in your wake. But if it's just you on this spirited journey, that's just as fun. You enjoy being independent.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
