    "horoscope": "Time for a game of 'follow the leader.' Everyone has their eyes on you now -- just the way you like it. The only thing is, you're not as aware as usual of being the center of attention. You're too concerned with freedom and ethics to worry about fame. Thus, your spirit shines even more brightly, and it's easy to convince people that yours is the right perspective. Lead them someplace meaningful. Don't waste this chance to create real change.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
