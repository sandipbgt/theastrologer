It's a great day to connect with someone you love. Simply sitting with a friend or relative is nice, even if you aren't talking or interacting much. You can commune with each other on a more emotional level. It's actually a relief not to have to assert yourself!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
