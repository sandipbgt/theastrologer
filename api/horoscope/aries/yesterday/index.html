    "horoscope": "Today, your usual impulsive methods may not be as effective as usual. If planning isn't your thing, it's a good day to develop this skill. Put some thought into your work or other projects. Don't assume details will take care of themselves, because they probably won't -- not under the current cosmic influence. The universe is pushing you to be more thorough in your efforts, so rise to the challenge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
