Food, touch and other sensual pleasures are especially nice right now, so go ahead and indulge in them. When that sense of satisfaction steals over you, you'll forget your irritation that this isn't the most action-packed day you've ever experienced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
