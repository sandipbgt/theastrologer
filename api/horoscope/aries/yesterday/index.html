    "horoscope": "You have an urge to doodle on the notepad or noodle on the piano. Yes, but where will it take you? Abstract creativity is okay if you have time to burn. But this one-day window could be decisive, especially if you're self-employed, a solo player, or otherwise the master of your own fate. Pour your efforts into something concrete. Produce a small miracle and push it out the door. Then go back inside and crank out another one while you still can. Maybe you never thought you'd kick into assembly line mode, but clearly it's time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
