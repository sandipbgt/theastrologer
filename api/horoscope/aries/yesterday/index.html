    "horoscope": "It's easier today than usual to put your ideas into words. You have a clever, articulate way of expressing yourself, so use it! Seek out the right people to discuss important subjects and ideas. Just a few well calculated conversations could get you on the road toward a new goal. Of course, simply chatting with friends and strangers is fun now, too. You may even be in the mood to get your flirt on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
