It's a great time for some one-on-one intensity with your sweetheart or a vigorous workout at the gym. But conversations and teamwork can be iffy for you now. If you feel yourself getting all worked up over something, take a deep breath, count to ten and remind yourself to play nice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
