    "horoscope": "Access your polite side today. You know exactly how to behave in mixed company, even if you don't always follow the rules of good manners.

Causing a stir of any kind just isn't favored. So relax, take a deep breath and smile.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
