Minor comments seem bigger and more upsetting than they might on a different day. It's important to keep your cool. In fact, look at it as a mathematical equation: The more unfair or upsetting something seems, the more you should try to stay calm and see the bright side of things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
