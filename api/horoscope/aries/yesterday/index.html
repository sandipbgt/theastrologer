    "horoscope": "Your keyword for the day is 'teamwork.' Keep that concept in mind in all you do. This is not the day for going rogue and doing your own thing regardless of what anyone else thinks about it. Instead, focus on collaborating and cooperating with the people around you -- your friends, family or business associates. There's power in numbers,. Courting others' approval isn't a sign of weakness, but of strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
