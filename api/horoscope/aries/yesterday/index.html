    "horoscope": "Your attention turns toward work, hard effort and professional matters today. You're directed and ambitious, perhaps even more so than usual. But this could mean you're not as sensitive to emotional issues as you should be. Do your best not to step on someone's feelings without realizing what you're doing. You're just trying to take care of business, but a friend or your partner may need a gentler touch than that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
