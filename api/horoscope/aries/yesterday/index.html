Once you're in it, it'll make so much sense. Just keep that wild enthusiasm flowing, breathing in the inspiration of your perfect world. Whichever way you push, there's no resistance now. See how long you can make it work for you. Once you look back in amazement at how long this glorious chunk of 'now' has lasted, then that business with the calendar will start making sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
