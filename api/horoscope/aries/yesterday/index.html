    "horoscope": "Today, impulsive moves aren't favored nearly so much as a careful, measured approach to any project or problem. It may be tough to rein in your urge to act and react, but try it, at least for now. This influence is blessedly short-lived. While it's here, do your best to be practical about every step of your work or daily life. Most of all, make plans, instead of jumping into things like usual!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
