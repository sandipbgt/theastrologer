    "horoscope": "Impulsive? You? Yes -- today even more than usual! You have a taste for something fresh, and you don't want anyone or anything to limit you.

But you're extra creative now, so you can come up with ingenious ways of getting around these restrictions and finding the freedom you crave.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
