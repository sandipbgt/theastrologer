Otherwise, your current sense of tension may prod you into anger mode today. In the moment, of course, you'll be full of good excuses for why you said what you did, but later, you'll have to explain yourself -- and apologize. Just to be nice from the start.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
