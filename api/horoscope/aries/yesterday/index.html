    "horoscope": "You're an odd duck, you know that? You're stirring all kinds of things into the mix, but today they'll totally work for you. You'll swim against the tide while offering a pleasure cruise to anyone who wants to ride on your back. You'll build new, improved bridges to replace the ones you just burned. You're living on both banks of the river. You're neither fish nor fowl, yet you'll show off the best qualities of each. You'll comfortably inhabit both. Well, you can, so why not? That might be the only reason you need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
