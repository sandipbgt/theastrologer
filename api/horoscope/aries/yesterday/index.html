    "horoscope": "Good times are upon you, and you're full of life and laughter. At work, you keep your coworkers in stitches. At home, your family or roommates are smiling and shaking their heads. What's your secret? You're acting with all your heart instead of just using your head, and this is a trend you should stick with. Your generosity of spirit will pay off in strengthened friendships and even more people in your corner ready to help you reach your goals.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
