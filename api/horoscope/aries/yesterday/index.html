    "horoscope": "Impulsive moves could misfire today. Reality is a bit unclear, and your outlook isn't very practical. Ideals seem to hold more truth than anything concrete. It may take some time to determine the viability of a certain project or pursuit. The good news is that you can bounce back quickly from any problems. If you realize your goal isn't going to work out after all, you'll simply switch to a newer, better one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
