    "horoscope": "Your competitive streak runs strong within you today. Whether you're on the basketball court, in the boardroom or at home playing a game, you'll do whatever it takes to show your personal best.

Sometimes it's much wiser to cooperate instead of compete -- or even to let someone else win, for once. What a concept!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
