    "horoscope": "Your emotions are stirred up today. You might even wake up feeling cloudy, a feeling that may be left over from a sad, strange or disturbing dream. You'll notice you're a lot more sensitive now than usual. Do your best not to overreact when you feel hurt or slighted. You tend to react first and then consider whether you perceived things correctly. But it would be better to reverse that order!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
