    "horoscope": "You're feeling ambitious today, and with good reason. You know what you're capable of, and you have the confidence to let others know, as well. So whatever -- or whomever! -- you have your eye on, go for it. A promotion, a date or anything else can be yours if you step up and take it. But do remember to rely on charm today, not arrogance. People respond much better when you're friendly and smiling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
