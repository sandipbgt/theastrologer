Your audacity is a force in itself; it's that dash of daring that helps you slide through rough spots and come out squeaky-clean. Other people watch you in action and only wish they could be so bold! Instead of using this up on silly feats of fearlessness that are ultimately pointless, apply it consciously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
