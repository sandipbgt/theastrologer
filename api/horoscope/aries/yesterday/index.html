It's as if your inner passion has moved to your brain, and you're hanging back, taking a more cerebral, intellectual view of life. That's not a bad thing, especially since you're normally so impulsive. Sometimes it's good to take a break from acting on every little feeling you have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
