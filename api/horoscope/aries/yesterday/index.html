Your conversations with other people could be very interesting now, since you're even more frank and outspoken than usual. But it's all in the name of inquiry into the people, places and events that capture your fascination. All this mental stimulation is sure to be great fun!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
