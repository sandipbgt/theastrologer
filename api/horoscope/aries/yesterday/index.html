    "horoscope": "In private, you're as spunky and opinionated as ever. In public, on the other hand, you're feeling a little shy today. The good news is, people are still able to sense your energy and abilities. If you have a job interview or any other type of audition lined up, rely on basic lessons of public comportment: Sit up straight, smile, and answer questions directly, with confidence. That should carry you through just fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
