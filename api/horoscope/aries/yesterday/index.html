    "horoscope": "'Lust for Life' could be your theme song, but the energy currently giving you wings isn't the kind to waste on frivolous frolicking. Instead, tap into your healthy store of ambition. That'll push you where you need to go -- out of the house, or at least out of your ordinary existence, and toward something fresh and inspiring. Today could spark a whole new way of life for you, but only if you're an active participant.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
