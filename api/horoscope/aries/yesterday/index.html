    "horoscope": "A vague urge for freedom blossoms today into a distinct need, one that won't be ignored. Many times this might cause issues in your immediate life, but today is different. Rather than fighting against the daily demands that bind you, you find internal independence. If you want an adventure but can't chase down your own, get a friend or coworker to recount one of theirs. Secondhand is better than none at all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
