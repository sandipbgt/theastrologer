If anyone disagrees with you, you could take it as an insult! Try to remember that everyone is entitled to their own point of view. Instead of reacting against differences of opinion, listen to the other side. They might be correct after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
