Ask penetrating questions that will cut straight to the truth. Monitor the flow of energy to see who's with you and who's not. You don't exactly need a loyalty oath, but a progress report would be OK. They won't mind you assuming the alpha position if you clearly know what you're doing. And you'll earn extra points if you keep them laughing. People are less likely to resent a superior intelligence that keeps them entertained.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
