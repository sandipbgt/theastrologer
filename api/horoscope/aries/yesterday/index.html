    "horoscope": "Commitment and conviction are often good qualities, especially when it comes to work or creative projects. But when these qualities lead to questionable behavior, they're not so great after all. Perhaps it's time to rethink the route toward your goals. Instead of shoving forward aggressively, take a gentler, more open approach. People will really appreciate any attempt on your part to unite everyone instead of dividing and conquering.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
