    "horoscope": "Your usual high energy is even higher today. You're ardently in love with the world, and you crave excitement. No worries there -- you'll scare up some fun, if it doesn't find you first. Anyone you encounter today will be impressed with your vibrancy and spirit, so if you have an important meeting planned, go in with confidence. Your warmth will break any ice, and your sense of purpose will convince even the skeptics.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
