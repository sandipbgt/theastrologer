    "horoscope": "You're worried and feeling a little out of control, aren't you? And you're responding by tightening your grip on a situation or relationship that currently seems tense. But there's danger in being too strict. You might alienate a key ally today, if you keep up the way you're going. Cooperation and sensitivity aren't exactly your strong points, so you'll just have to stretch yourself. Try to stay fluid so other people won't feel frozen out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
