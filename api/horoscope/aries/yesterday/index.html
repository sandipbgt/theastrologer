    "horoscope": "You're feeling restless today, and your energy is hard to contain. If you have an office job, or any work that requires you to stay in one place for long periods of time, it could be really tough to stick to your agenda! But that's all right -- you're creative enough to find ways to change up your day. Try scheduling several short errands or meetings rather than long stretches of focused work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
