    "horoscope": "They're being unreasonable idiots and you're not exactly patient. Well, who could blame you? Even so, it'll be your call whether you fight or cooperate with them. Because what's in it for you? That's certainly the up-front, age-old question when you're looking out for number one, but try to be more objective today. Once you step out of the haze of your ego and into the bright clarity of the big reality out yonder, you'll find your answers there. Amazing how simple that is once you do it.
