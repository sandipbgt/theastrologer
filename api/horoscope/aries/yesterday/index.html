    "horoscope": "Suddenly, your self-confidence diminishes. You feel alone, and you realize that it's up to you to provide for yourself. That may be a bit depressing, but perhaps it's a needed reality check. Your high energy and confidence count for a lot, but you also need to put in hard work if you want success or a stable future. If that's your plan of action, proceed accordingly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
