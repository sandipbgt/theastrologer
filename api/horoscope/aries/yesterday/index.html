    "horoscope": "Adapt to new relationships as they happen. It shouldn't be too hard while everything still feels so new. Be a pioneer or a warrior, although you should stop short of playing the conqueror. Get along with people instead of trying to dominate them. It helps that you feel creative today, too. The ideas just keep coming and coming. Although anything could happen from this point, including failure, you should remain optimistic. Put in the energy that will match the outcome you want. In other words, start thinking like a winner.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
