    "horoscope": "This isn't a good day for working quietly on your own. You crave action and interaction. It's a perfect day for a dinner party, a date with someone special and interesting, or a debate over a subject you're passionate about. You can present your ideas with energy, but in a way that doesn't put others on the defensive. Or maybe people are just more open-minded now than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
