    "horoscope": "You approach today with your usual spunk and enthusiasm. You greet the world with open arms, and it smiles right back at you. Social interactions go smoothly and even bring unexpected opportunities your way. As usual, you jump on what looks like a good chance to further your personal cause. Do your part of the homework and gather the important details. This might be a team effort, but everyone's input is necessary.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
