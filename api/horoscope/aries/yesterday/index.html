    "horoscope": "You're more emotional today than usual, and though you can sometimes be a bit self-focused, now you're more attuned to others' needs and feelings. Do something today to benefit someone else. Bring dinner to the elderly couple that lives next door, walk your neighbor's dog, or ask a friend if they need to talk out a problem. Selfless acts of service or charity will make you feel good about yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
