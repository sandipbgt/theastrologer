    "horoscope": "Right now it's all too easy to jump the gun in a snappish moment. Any tense situations at work or at home will need to be carefully navigated. Restrain yourself, despite the strain of how unfamiliar that feels. You don't like limiting yourself, after all. But right now, it's more prudent to hold your cards. If you let others know how strongly you feel about something, they might disagree just to be contrary. But don't worry: Things will be back to normal soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
