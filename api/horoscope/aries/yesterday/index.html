    "horoscope": "Be especially considerate of others today. Many folks are in a sensitive, sentimental mood. It's all too easy to step on their feelings before you even realize what you've done. In general, a softer touch works well now. Approach your friends with care, and be gentle even if you get upset about something. You can do or say just about anything today, Aries. It's all in the delivery.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
