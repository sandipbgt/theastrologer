    "horoscope": "Let the laugh-fest begin, because right now you're just bursting with comic energy. That's comic and not cosmic, although today you'll have them rolling in the aisles when you tap into those universal jokes that make everyone laugh at themselves. And when you make them see how much they have in common, they'll laugh together. Seriously, why aren't you doing this onstage somewhere? You're providing a valuable service, and you could be brave and smart enough to turn this into a career. Yes, but would you get rich doing it? Just kidding about that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
