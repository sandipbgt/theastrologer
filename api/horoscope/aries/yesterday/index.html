Your eyes are wide open, like a child's on Christmas morning -- full of wonder and imagination. You're already making plans. But the time is right not just for planning. Step up and make a move. Draw from that inner wellspring of courage you're so famous for, and push forward into your destiny.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
