    "horoscope": "Today your mind speeds ahead like a race car, your thoughts shiny and enticing. You have plenty of initiative, which is important if you're getting a new project off the ground. But your follow-through may be lacking at the moment. That's okay -- it's a day for beginnings, for some uncertainty. Chase down ideas to see where they lead. Don't worry just yet about how to tie them all together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
