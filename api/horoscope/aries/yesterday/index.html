    "horoscope": "You aren't used to feeling emotionally vulnerable or sensitive, but that's exactly the mood you could be in today. The best way to deal with this is to remind yourself that it's just a mood -- this, too, shall pass. And get creative. You're deeply attuned to your own feelings as well as others' emotional expressions, which means you can write, paint, dance or make music with great passion. Don't hold back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
