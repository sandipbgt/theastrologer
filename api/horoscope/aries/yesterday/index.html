You'll notice that your employer, coworkers or other people are frowning on coarse or impulsive behavior, even if they would normally tolerate it -- or even join in the fun. Pretending to be proper might irritate you, but it's better than the alternative. It's no fun to be criticized because you made a crude joke, so save it for another day!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
