    "horoscope": "Don't feel obligated to throw your efforts into a certain cause or project today. If it's making you feel uptight, that's because you aren't doing this of your own accord. You feel forced into it, and no matter how compelling the reasons, you're still chafing within the limitations. All you can do is push through it, and lend your support. Soon, this won't feel like such an imposition. Slowly but surely, you'll start believing in your own positive effect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
