It's as if the spotlight is on you, and you're tossing off one-liners  like beads at Mardi Gras. Everyone appreciates your storytelling style. But make sure you stay tactful in any type of professional environment. You wouldn't want to trample on anyone's feelings or their pride, even accidentally. A bit of respect mixed in with your bold approach should do the trick.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
