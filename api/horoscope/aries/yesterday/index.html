You can really make things happen now, so connect with the right VIPs, and be sure to make your actions matter. Consider -- what do you want to accomplish? Don't be selfish in your efforts, either: This period is all about broad strokes that benefit everyone. It's perfectly appropriate to enjoy your luck, but don't build on it. Instead, build on genuine drive and effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
