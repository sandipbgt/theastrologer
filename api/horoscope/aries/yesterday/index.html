    "horoscope": "You're an adventurer at heart, and especially today. Your confidence and daring are set on high, and you're ready to try just about anything. Whatever you're up to, you're looking for bigtime thrills that will leave you feeling exhilarated and craving more. This is the perfect time to go out on a limb and test your new wings, but do try to use your better judgment. Pushing yourself in your workout is fine; trying a bold approach at the office is great. Blowing your whole paycheck on your favorite hobby? Maybe not the best idea.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
