    "horoscope": "Your natural leadership qualities are shining today. But if you want other people to feel inspired by you, so they'll follow your example and your bidding, treat them with respect. At the moment, you're all business. You can envision the end goal, and you want to get something accomplished. But social niceties are still important! Instead of barking orders, ask for input. When giving feedback, offer encouragement, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
