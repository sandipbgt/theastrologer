And when pure luck falters, your confidence and sense of conviction will do the rest. With such a solid sense of self, you can relish your power without abusing it. Other people will respect you, and they're more likely to go along with your brave ideas. Just make sure your courage doesn't veer into recklessness, and you can achieve great things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
