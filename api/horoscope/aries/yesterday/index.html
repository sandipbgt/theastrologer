    "horoscope": "Tune into yourself. React to what's happening. Your feelings are suddenly acute and vivid. You're right in there with the good, the bad and the ugly, and somehow it's all OK. Since you're a life student, there's a lot to squeeze out of every experience. You never know what's going to be on the test. Today you'll get to demonstrate the really positive emotions, just because everything is so friendly, happy, comfortable and exciting. Even if you don't go into this with a plan of action, you'll find your way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
