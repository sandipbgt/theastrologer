    "horoscope": "Welcome to an emotional day. Things may move along more slowly than you would prefer, because many people are dealing with the confusion that comes with stirred up emotions. You might feel impatient with this foggy sense of melancholy, but irritation won't speed things up at all. In fact, you could inadvertently hurt someone's feelings if you aren't sensitive or compassionate enough. Deal gently with people, especially those you care about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
