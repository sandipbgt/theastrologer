If you can be more observant during uneasy time, you won't be so overbearing to others. The thing is, their seemingly radical ideas aren't really that out-there. Try to be more open instead of dismissing them out of hand. You might even need to hand over the lead on any projects you've got going, which is hard for you to do. If nothing else, go easy on yourself. Things aren't as bad as they might seem.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
