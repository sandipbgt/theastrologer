    "horoscope": "Your usual high energy banks a bit today. You may find yourself spacing out while you're trying to work. It's okay to let your mind wander now. Daydreaming may be the best you can do at the moment! And it can bring on highly creative ideas, if you make space for them. Then, when you're feeling more energetic, you can see if they're actually viable in the real world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
