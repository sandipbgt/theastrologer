    "horoscope": "Life is a mixed bag today, with things getting more serious as the day rolls along. What starts off as a fine morning can quickly develop into something more serious, and by evening, there could be a definite crunch involving love or money. But don't let this get you down. You can deal with any problems that come your way. That's how you grow and develop as a human being.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
