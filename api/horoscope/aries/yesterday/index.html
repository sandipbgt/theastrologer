    "horoscope": "Suddenly you're fearless. Your ambitions dangle like a carrot, and your urgency drums on you like a stick. But even though you're all about energy and effort today, don't go charging off without locking up or tying down the stuff you have to leave behind. You could be gone for up to a month, and there's no telling who could steal your trophies. Or what circumstances might undo all your hard work. This is where it pays to have friends and neighbors you can trust. Stay in touch with the right people and you won't have to worry about a thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
