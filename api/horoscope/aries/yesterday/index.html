    "horoscope": "The best thing about you now is that you're faithful to your ideals. Your mind and eyes are sharp, your grasp of morals and principles strong, and you're tuned in to a larger truth. This means you can enlighten your friends and associates, especially if you keep telling it like it is. No one's going to argue with you. They all recognize your connection to a higher reality, and they're willing to listen to your perspective, especially if you offer ideas to make things better for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
