Whether this realization came about because you want something you can't quite afford or because your budget started feeling restrictive, it's time to do something about it. Financial planning is a smart strategy at any age or stage of life. Yes, it may be tedious, but sit down and make a plan today, anyway. You'll be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
