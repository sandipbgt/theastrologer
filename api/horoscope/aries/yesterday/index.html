    "horoscope": "At the moment, your words are as bright and vivacious as your personality. You're backing your solid convictions with vivid descriptions, and everyone is listening. They're looking to you for answers, because they recognize you as one of the sharpest minds in the room -- and one of the most innovative. That's a good thing, too, because today, you're all about telling rather than showing. Is this out of laziness? Probably not, but even if it were, no one would mind. They're just happy someone's providing guidance and inspiration.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
