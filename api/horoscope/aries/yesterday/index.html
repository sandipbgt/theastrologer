    "horoscope": "Usually you pour a blast of energy into whatever seems most interesting at the moment. But today is one of those days when you feel a bit more deliberate about things.

But tackling it now is better, since it's easier than usual to get into a groove of work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
