    "horoscope": "Action yields to compassion today. Your mood is soft, and you don't react to other people with your usual vigor. Maybe since you can understand where people are coming from, you don't get worked up about it even if they step on your toes in some way. It's good for you to have a few days like this every month, Aries. It keeps your powers of empathy well honed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
