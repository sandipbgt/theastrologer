    "horoscope": "What brought on this peppery mood? You're full of sass and vinegar, surprising everyone with your hilarious comments. But you're also incredibly creative, and with your heightened energy, you could make something truly exciting happen. You're perfectly positioned to learn yet another life lesson -- a fun, exciting one. Open yourself to any experiences that come your way. Get out of the house, or even out of town, and gobble up as much adventure as you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
