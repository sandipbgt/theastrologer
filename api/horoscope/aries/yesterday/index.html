    "horoscope": "A burst of energy makes you daring today. You aren't afraid of rigid boundaries. In fact, you're drawn to them, if only to prove they're able to be crossed! It's like the old saying, 'Rules were made to be broken.' That's your attitude today, and anything goes. Don't be surprised if your employer, your partner or someone else doesn't appreciate your independent thinking. Maybe they just aren't as open-minded as you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
