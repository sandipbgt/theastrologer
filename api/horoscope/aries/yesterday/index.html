    "horoscope": "Sometimes you appear so sophisticated, always wearing and saying the right thing. Other times people consider you childlike, whether it's because you're too loud, too needy or somehow inappropriate. Well, you know what? Forget them. You're looking at a bigger picture than they are, and none of this little stuff matters to you. Instead of following stupid rules, please yourself today. It's all you can do. Of course, there will be times when you'll have to read the memo, toe the line and keep up with the Joneses, but this is still your moment. Celebrate your uniqueness while you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
