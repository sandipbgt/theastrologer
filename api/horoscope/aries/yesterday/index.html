    "horoscope": "It's okay to take life slowly today. You don't always have to be a blazing inferno of energy, you know. Sometimes it's good to slow down and enjoy the people and pleasures right in your own home or neighborhood. Besides, you're gearing up for a couple of high-energy days very soon, so conserve energy now. Take a nap today, or a bubble bath. Call your best friend or a beloved relative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
