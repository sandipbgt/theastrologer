    "horoscope": "The past was a rockin' good time. You're not so sure the future will be in tune with anything you care about. Maybe that's why you're wary of actual or proposed changes today. But the changes you should really worry about are the ones that result from your own bad judgment. It's not that your judgment is always bad, but it may be somewhat impaired by your feelings right now. Don't go bragging, picking a fight or otherwise overreacting until you know every little thing. There's a lot more to this song than meets the ear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
