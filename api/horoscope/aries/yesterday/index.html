    "horoscope": "You run a virile enterprise, or maybe a fertile one. You love initiating new projects and throwing your boundless energy into them. But today, business will be slow. You could start feeling like a caged lion, pacing back and forth in a space that's too small to contain your power, as you wait impatiently for things to pick up. But try not to worry. This is all part of the cycle. Soon the pace will pick up. Your phone will start ringing off the hook, and you might even think longingly of this brief period of downtime!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
