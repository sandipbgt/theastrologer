    "horoscope": "Life gets intense today. Your passionate nature is right at the surface of your consciousness. You're attracted to potent people and deeply intimate encounters.

It's good to delve into your own inner power, but try not to create dramatic situations purely for their own sake.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
