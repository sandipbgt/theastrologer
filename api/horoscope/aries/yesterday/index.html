    "horoscope": "Currently, you enjoy an interesting and useful balance. Certain old-fashioned words describe you, like 'splendid, 'gallant' and 'courtly,.' On the other had, you have a downright futuristic vision. This situation is interesting purely because it's self-contradictory. It's useful because with your current energy, you could really get things moving in your personal or professional life. What project have you been dreaming of lately? That's where should put your energy now. I(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
