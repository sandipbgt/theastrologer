Enjoy your friends and loved ones. When the conversation turns toward intimate or personal subjects, go ahead and dig in. You can gain a lot of self-awareness now, simply by exploring those dark places. But be mindful of your own sensitive points, and others' too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
