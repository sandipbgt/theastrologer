    "horoscope": "Avoid sudden outbursts today. You want to make a big, noisy, but you're better off swimming quietly in your own lane. Take the hype out of your mythic tales, even if you think that's unbearably dull. Respect others' delicate sensibilities, even if you disagree with them. If this sounds like too much to ask, take a moment to consider your position and objectives. You have plenty of projects in need of completion, and you could really use some allies in making that happen. The best way to draw them to your side? Being humble and respectful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
