    "horoscope": "Today is a great day to take action. You're feeling ambitious enough to pursue your goals with great vigor. But you're also lighthearted enough to have fun while you're at it -- and to maintain a sense of humor about yourself. That counts for a lot, whether you're pursuing a romantic interest or a professional contact. People respond well to you when you're warm and jovial as well as focused and interesting!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
