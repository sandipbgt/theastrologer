    "horoscope": "Rein in any feelings of jealousy you experience today. It may seem as if someone else has something you want, whether it's a certain job or an intimate relationship. But remember that everyone has challenges as well as blessings. You never know -- that person just might be jealous of something you have that they lack! Keeping that in mind may help you shoo away that green-eyed monster.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
