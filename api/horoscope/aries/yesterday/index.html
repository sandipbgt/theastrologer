Of course, there's still plenty of stewing and brewing going on inside you, and soon you'll feel more open about expressing it. So stay in touch with your feelings, but rather than opening your mouth, open your ears. You don't have to accept everything people say.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
