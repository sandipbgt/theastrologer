    "horoscope": "You're unusually sympathetic to the feelings and needs of others today. Your heart is a little softer than usual, and you can tell when someone near you needs a strong shoulder to lean on. You're even feeling a little sentimental, so it's a great day to pull out the photo album or keepsake box and pore over old memories. Romance provides a great release, too. You can almost feel yourself merging with your sweetheart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
