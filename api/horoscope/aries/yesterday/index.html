    "horoscope": "Your enthusiasm for life itself is high today. You can turn just about any situation into a party -- even a dull meeting at work! Just work your charms on the people around you. Tell a joke. Get them laughing. Soon, your high energy spreads through the room, infecting everyone. When people are grinning and having a good time, even dull situations are more bearable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
