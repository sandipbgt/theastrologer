Don't let anyone limit your potential now -- not that you need the warning! Under the current cosmic influence, you'll blast through obstacles as if they're nothing at all. In fact, you may not see them as obstacles. Instead, you'll view them as welcome tests of your considerable prowess.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
