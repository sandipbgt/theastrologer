    "horoscope": "Tensions may be simmering in your close relationships and partnerships, and you know that confrontation could happen if you just rise to the bait. You've got a choice to make now. Why not make the right one instead of the easy one? All you have to do is stay cool, calm and collected, and resist the urge to respond to challenges. Keep your sense of humor and use this time to build relationships.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
