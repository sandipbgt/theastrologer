Yes, you can be sincere and irreverent at the same time. You're viewing the world with a sense of amusement. Things that might normally frustrate you make you laugh. Use this elevated view of life's possibilities to accomplish something great.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
