    "horoscope": "Today, life is grounded in the physical senses. Enjoy yourself on this level. Revel in flavors, textures and other sensations. Become a creature of the body: Hug your friends, or do your favorite kind of exercise. Stretching your muscles is especially pleasurable now. So is sitting down to a meal with people you love. Don't bolt through the food like you usually do, though. Linger over it, and savor it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
