    "horoscope": "Today you want to stand on your own two feet, no matter what. You're a spirited individual, that's for sure! Spur-of-the-moment ideas and activities make for a fast-paced day. You're following your whims. If someone tries to advise caution, you won't listen. You're making your own way in the world, and that's just the way you like it. There's a lot to be said for that kind of self-confidence!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
