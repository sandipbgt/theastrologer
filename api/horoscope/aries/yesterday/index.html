    "horoscope": "Are you chasing your own tail on some kind of emotional treadmill? First you're anxious, then you're hyper, then upset, and then sorry, or even guilty. This cycle will keep repeating unless you do something to interrupt it. Some rigorous exercise would help. So would spending some time alone, or practicing a little deep-breathing or yoga. If you don't use any of these techniques, at least you can try not to prolong the tension unnecessarily.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
