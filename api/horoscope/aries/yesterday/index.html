    "horoscope": "Sometimes, depending on your reality or goals, you can't get away with being gentle. So if you end up using force, try to be as accurate and appropriate as you can.

They're expecting an easy day, too, and just like you they deserve to get what they want. Don't disappoint them. And if you want to go out of your way to make them happy, well, there just might be a little something in it for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
