    "horoscope": "Pushy types may push away certain kinds of attention if they have something to hide. If you're vulnerable and you try to cover it up with aggression, those concealed weaknesses will become glaringly apparent today. So here's a little tip. Don't go annoying the people who suspect your secret. Don't call others the very names you're afraid of being called. This is how bullies operate, and you have so evolved beyond that point. Take a deep breath and confront your fears. Ideally you'd do this in private. Healing yourself won't benefit from a public spectacle at this time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
