    "horoscope": "Skeptics will speak out whether or not anyone wants to hear their harsh version of the truth. Challengers are ratcheting up the pressure because they think it'll give them an advantage. So what role are you playing? Maybe you want to look good in the eyes of the rich and powerful. Maybe you just want to get along and be left alone. Wherever you are in the spectrum of light conversation or dark predictions, this will be an emotionally charged day. Please keep the debate civil.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
