So does willingness to compromise, even -- or especially -- when you really, really want to get your way. Cooperation is a survival skill. You need to master it in order to have good personal and professional relationships. Today is an opportunity to hone your skills in getting along with others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
