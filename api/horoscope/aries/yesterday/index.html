    "horoscope": "Issues of partnership and cooperation claim your attention today. Your spouse or business partner may bring up a problem they want to resolve. If so, it's likely to be something involving an imbalance of power or responsibility. Do your best to treat their perceptions as valid, even if you think they're utterly off base. Under the current influence, it's more important to get along than to prove your point.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
