    "horoscope": "Your impulsive nature is highlighted today, because your emotions are stirred up. It's a good idea to get some exercise, so you can blow off a little steam in a fun, healthy way. Watch how you express yourself if you get into a heavy discussion with someone. You might be tempted to yell out your tension, but doing so will only make it worse. Instead, stay calm and try to maintain a sense of perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
