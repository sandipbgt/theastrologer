    "horoscope": "You've got some truly great stories, and now's the time to share them. Open up to someone you don't normally interact with. Talk about your travels, and ask about theirs. Compare notes. And don't forget the importance of making your audience laugh. You're a natural comedian, so everyone's happy to pay attention to your funny digressions. Best of all, you'll grow through reliving your story for others. Maybe there's a chapter you'd forgotten, or one you've never really inspected before? New perspective looms -- isn't this exciting?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
