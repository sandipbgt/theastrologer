    "horoscope": "Be careful how you speak to people today, especially those important to you, like loved ones or your boss. You don't want to burn any bridges just because you're in an uneasy mood. Avoid hurting others' feelings or annoying them with short, shallow responses. That'll only slam the door shut on any chance for a meaningful conversation. Speak up, of course, if you have good reason. Staying silent in the face of injustice would be unbearable. Just choose your words carefully, and store away your passion for later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
