You're filled with enthusiasm and vitality, and your day feels like one big thrill ride. If you focus on a goal today, you'll be unstoppable. Feeling good has turned you into a champion, so use that energy and dare to set a new record. Others cheer you on from the sidelines.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
