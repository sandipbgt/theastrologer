    "horoscope": "Today should be about pure enjoyment of life. You get a kick out of telling a joke to make a friend laugh. A baby's smile warms you to your toes. Meeting someone new is a rush, because you can tell they're charmed by your antics. Wouldn't it be nice if every day felt like this? But since that's not the case, take advantage of this high, fine energy while it lasts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
