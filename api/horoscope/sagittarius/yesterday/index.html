After all, there's always someone who's got it better than you do. But if you dig beneath this superficial level, you'll find that, deep down, you're just the same as everyone else -- and even a little bit better than some, though that's no reason to develop a superiority complex. Instead, focus on what's most important: We're all human. How's that for a mind-expanding revelation?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
