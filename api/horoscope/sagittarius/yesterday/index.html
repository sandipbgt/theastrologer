Under the current energy, experiences are meant to be shared. Discuss your feelings and impressions, and listen to others tell about their own. Create a sense of community through communication. It doesn't matter whether this is in person, online or on the phone. All that matters is making that connection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
