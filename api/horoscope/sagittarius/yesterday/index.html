    "horoscope": "Gather with friends and family today, if you can. You're in a  mood to celebrate, and you're taking extra pleasure in your connections with other people. If you're stuck at the office, find something creative to work on. A potentially dull business meeting can be enlivened by an impromptu brainstorming session. After work, a romantic date or an evening out with friends provides the perfect closure to a successful day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
