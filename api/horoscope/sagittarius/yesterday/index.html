    "horoscope": "Exercise caution today. Be thorough and careful in your work, and spend money only on necessary items. This may seem overly prudish, but excess and carelessness just aren't favored right now. It's far more prudent to guard your resources, including money, energy and time. This is all about stretching out the important stuff. That way, you'll have enough later on, when you need it even more than you do now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
