    "horoscope": "You're brooding, which is a truly unusual event in your life. But you've picked a good time for some self-reflection. A deep look inside never hurt anyone, especially when it doesn't happen often, as in your case. Take a quiet day for yourself -- and don't blame others for your problems. Remember that you're the key to every single situation in your life. You'll come out of this understanding yourself and others better."
