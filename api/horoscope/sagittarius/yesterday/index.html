    "horoscope": "Being spontaneous is extra fun today, because it's favored by the current cosmic energy. Your energy is off the charts, and you have a nose for adventure. Your only requirement is independence! You need the time and space to find your own path. Strike out on your own and feel your way along. It doesn't matter if you make mistakes. They're all learning experiences that help you understand life better!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
