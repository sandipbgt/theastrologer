    "horoscope": "Sometimes reality can be a tad harsh. This could be one of those times. Maybe that's why you'll prefer the antiseptic version to something grittier. Your eyes drift past what you'd rather not see. Your words will dance around disturbing ideas. If you censor heavily, it'll be obvious that pieces are missing. If you prefer to be polite and subtle, you'll communicate in graceful gestures that no one will understand. This fear of unspoken things can only subvert your normal life. You'll face them sooner or later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
