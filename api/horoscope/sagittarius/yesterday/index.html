    "horoscope": "There's a wonderfully zany energy at work today. You might wake up feeling excited. Keep that sense of discovery near you as you go about your business. It's more important than ever to embrace unfamiliar ideas and experiences. Of course, knowing you, you won't just grab the unknown -- you'll run with it! And that's exactly the right attitude today. Seek out unusual events and people that challenge your idea of 'normal.'(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
