You might clear out your workspace or fine-tune a proposal for your employer. You may simply work carefully and diligently toward a deadline. These suggestions probably makes your skin crawl. Why does the prospect of organizing make you restless? You've wanted this for ages. Even if you can't motivate yourself to push forward on a project, don't change anything yet. At least use today for thinking.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
