    "horoscope": "There are people you hope to flatter -- maybe someone cute you'd like to take out on a date, or a business associate you'd like to woo on a professional level. You like their ideas and their energy, and better yet, they like yours just as much. You're making a great impression without even trying. That high-wattage smile on your face has the power to draw allies and admirers -- enjoy the easy collaboration and vibrant creativity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
