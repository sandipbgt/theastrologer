Use your scientific mind to cook up explanations everyone can understand. Find clever applications for every little idea, and that's your strategy right there. If they perceive you as a creative thinker and fixer-upper, you'll be going somewhere good. And if, along the way, you finally complete your transformation from a noisy protester to a results-oriented prophet, there's an excellent chance that you'll arrive in style.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
