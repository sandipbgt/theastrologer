    "horoscope": "Today, your idealistic nature comes to the fore. It's wonderful to be able to envision life in all its infinite and beautiful possibilities. But what happens when it turns out that your pretty dreams and visions aren't quite as lovely or as plausible as you imagined? That's the kind of realization you could have today. Don't let it get you down! Keep your optimism -- it's a true gift, in this sometimes harsh world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
