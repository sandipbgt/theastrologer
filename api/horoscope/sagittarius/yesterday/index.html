    "horoscope": "If someone around you is acting crazy today, you're still able to stay rational and calmly introspective. You just aren't buying into the drama, and that's a good thing. So what if other people think that's dull? You're just doing what you have to do, and taking care of business. Someone has to, and you could end up scoring brownie points with your boss if you stick to the task at hand instead of getting swept up in others' theatrics.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
