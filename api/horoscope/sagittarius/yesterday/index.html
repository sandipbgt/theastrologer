    "horoscope": "You've never been very practical. You're more interested in big ideas than mundane concerns. But today, you might have a hard time distinguishing pie-in-the-sky ideals from cold, hard reality. And the truth is, you'd rather not face reality if it's cold and hard! Your own dreams and fantasies are so much more appealing. Just don't deceive yourself. Knowing what's possible and what isn't helps you move forward.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
