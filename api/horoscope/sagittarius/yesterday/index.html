    "horoscope": "Your mood is buoyant. Any gathering of people seems to you like a good excuse for a party, whether it's an actual party complete with drinks, music and twinkling lights, or just a group of coworkers hanging out in the break room. Your sense of humor really shines today, because your energy is turned on like a light bulb. It's a great time for making new friends, so be as outgoing as you like.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
