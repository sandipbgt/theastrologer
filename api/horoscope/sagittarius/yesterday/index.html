    "horoscope": "Welcome to a fast-paced, boisterous day. You might even be feeling like a kid again! Romping around with children is a great way to expend some excess energy. Friends offer a lot of warmth and cheer, too. It's not a good day to split off on your own, unless you just have to indulge your muse in a creative project. In that case, go for it, and let your imagination roam.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
