    "horoscope": "Just because you're friendly doesn't mean you're a pushover. You can be generous without giving the house away. That comes into play today as something in the air, or perhaps some inner instinct, urges you to be careful. Be alert, aware and wary -- but not suspicious -- of others' intentions. There's nothing wrong with making them prove themselves. Anyone who does so under these conditions is sure to become part of your inner sanctum.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
