Your impulse might be to stir things up and create your own adventure, but it's better just to relax and take the day as it comes. It's easier than usual to create steady forward momentum, so throw yourself into a project. You might get so wrapped up in it that you look up and realize hours have passed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
