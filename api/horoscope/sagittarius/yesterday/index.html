    "horoscope": "Recently, you planted a new seed, whether a literal or a figurative one, and now it's growing underground. It may be invisible, but trust that it's full of vigorous life force. Be aware that being curious and poking around down there will only disturb its progress. Distract your mind by staying occupied with other interests. Look forward to the future. That's always a positive way for you to spend your time,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
