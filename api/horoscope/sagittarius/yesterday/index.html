But apathy isn't helping your long-term situation. Yes, you should throw away what you don't need, although you might want to go over that list again. Follow your heart or conscience today. Don't worry if you suddenly notice that your ego isn't along for the ride. Who cares if this little excursion of yours looks weird? Now you get to actually be who you are. Isn't that a relief?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
