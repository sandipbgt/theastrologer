    "horoscope": "You're usually so optimistic and carefree that it's hard for people to handle you in a bad mood. But recently, in some area of your life, you didn't get your way. You thought you could convince people to join your side, but it didn't work out, and it's making you grumpy. You're just off, and people are finding you crusty and uncomfortable. Stop it, right this very second! You still have many friends and allies, whether you recognize it right now or not. Don't dwell on your shortcomings -- count your blessings instead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
