    "horoscope": "Your energy mellows today, along with your mood. The pace of life slows to a steady roll, and you would be smart to flow right along with it. Of course, depending on your personality, you might be inspired to shake things up a little, purely because everyone around you is so relaxed! But wouldn't it be nicer just to enjoy some R&R with your favorite people? Not every day has to be an adventure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
