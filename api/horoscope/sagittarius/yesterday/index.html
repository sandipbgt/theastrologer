And now your blood is moving, your heart is pounding and you're craving some action -- some high-speed travel, maybe, or the zesty flavors of foreign food. You're in it for the fun, but perhaps not for the long haul. As usual, you'll guard your freedom with everything you've got. Take this brief stint for what it is: a chance at pure, pulse-pounding good times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
