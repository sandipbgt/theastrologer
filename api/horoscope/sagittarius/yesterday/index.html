    "horoscope": "It's a great day for brainstorming and networking. This is the true power of a group of people: Creative ideas start to flow, producing a wonderfully proactive energy. Soon, a project takes on a life of its own, and all you have to do is ride the wave. Be an inspiration to others in this first phase of generating ideas. Communicate your broad view. No idea is too great or too small.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
