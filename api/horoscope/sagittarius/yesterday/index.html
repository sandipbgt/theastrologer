    "horoscope": "You've always sought out broad, universal truths, and today some doors might open in that regard -- but probably not in the way you'll expect. Sober and hardworking is the mode of the day -- face your responsibilities at work and at home with careful, focused attention. But there's no need to be somber about it. Rather, try to recognize that maturity brings truth. A day or two of quiet reflection will reveal this to you, and you'll realize this is something not to avoid or regret, but to celebrate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
