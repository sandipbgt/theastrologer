    "horoscope": "Today it's important to plan your moves rather than acting on impulse. You're capable of great self-control when you put your mind to it. Think of it as an exercise: You're learning to restrain your urges and channel your energies. And while it may feel overly calculated to plan everything out in such detail, you'll find you get the best results in work and other projects by doing so.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
