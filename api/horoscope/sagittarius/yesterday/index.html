    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic energy emphasizes logical processes and methodical approaches. Invite this energy into your life by taking greater care than usual in your work, your diet and so on. When problems arise, take a methodical approach to resolving them, and place a premium on good health. Being this cautious may not be your style, but even doing this just for a day or two should have positive effects.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
