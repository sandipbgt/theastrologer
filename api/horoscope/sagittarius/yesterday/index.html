    "horoscope": "Your agreeable nature opens lots of doors for you today. Everyone wants to be near someone as fun, interesting and easygoing as you. Your creativity appeals to people, and it's easy to make new friends now. You can be clever about this, too. Your wide-eyed curiosity in others masks any agenda you may have, such as gaining support for a project or movement you're trying to get off the ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
