It seems like they're pushing your patience way over the edge, well past what you should be expected to swallow -- except maybe they have a point. Either way, you're sure to strain at the bonds of your own needs and expectations today. Every now and then, though, you have to give ground to another person, and honor their position over your own. This could be a good lesson for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
