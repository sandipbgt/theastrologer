Even if you were planning to take your dinner elsewhere, creativity offers you the best seat at the table. OK, you're in. And it looks like you're about to have an all-out banquet instead of just another fast food download. Today, start inventing what may last a lifetime. Maybe you'll make radical changes in the way you live, or maybe you'll go back to the same old same old with the intention to start living better. Quality of life is pretty important, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
