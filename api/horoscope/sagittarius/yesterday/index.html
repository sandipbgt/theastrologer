    "horoscope": "Your lighthearted, optimistic outlook gives way to an awareness of the complexities that lie beneath the surface of a relationship or project. Suddenly, it's apparent that things won't be quite as simple as you thought. But are they ever simple? That's what life is all about -- bumps in the road, and how you navigate them. That's where your positive outlook comes in handy. Maintain your self-confidence. You'll get through this just fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
