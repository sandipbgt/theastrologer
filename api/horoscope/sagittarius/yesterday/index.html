    "horoscope": "If someone disagrees with you today, take it in stride. Be steadfast in your own position, and if you think you're being bullied, then by all means, show some gumption. Don't back down just because you encounter. On the other hand, it wouldn't do to push your own agenda just to gain power. Other people might have some valid points, too. Take the time to explore all ideas and options. It's OK if you don't get anywhere just yet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
