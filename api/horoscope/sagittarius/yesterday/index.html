    "horoscope": "You're a wanderer at heart, but today, home calls you. You just don't feel like getting out and about. Comfort takes a high priority now. Of course, if there's tension at home or among your loved ones, that may not provide much comfort at all. In that case, do your best to be a peacemaker. Talk things out, or at least soften the tension with kindness and humor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
