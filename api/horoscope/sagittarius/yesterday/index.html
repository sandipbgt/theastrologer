Your best bet is to show good will and good sense by not pushing your agenda too aggressively. You don't want to alienate anyone. As long as you're open and friendly, everyone is still your ally. And maybe there's room for everyone's needs to be met. See if a group brainstorming session can't inspire you to work together on this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
