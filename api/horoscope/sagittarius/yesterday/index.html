    "horoscope": "Your mood softens today. You may not have as much energy as usual, but that's not such a bad thing. It makes it more pleasant to sit with a loved one and absorb the story of their day. If they're having any sort of emotional crisis, you can show them great tenderness and care. If you're the one feeling a little moody, you'll find that compassion is readily available.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
