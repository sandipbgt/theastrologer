    "horoscope": "Your truth-seeking heart is brimming with warm, exploratory energy. You've got adventure on the mind today, and getting out is more fun than ever because your angle is truly independent. This brand-new perspective could really take you places -- at the very least, it'll provide a day of diversion. When you come home, you'll share what you found with anyone who's interested. This should make for some great fireside stories, if not a novel or two.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
