    "horoscope": "You flow easily from one group to another today. Whether you're among friends, strangers or business associates, it's easy to adapt to the conversation at hand. You're warmhearted and interested in just about everything anyone might bring to the table. Because you're so broad-minded, you can be instrumental if a disagreement springs up. Take a philosophical approach to problem-solving, and consider all sides of the issue.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
