Of course, your same old knee-jerk reaction might not be doing much for this little moment of drama, either. Maybe it's your turn to change. Dare yourself to agree with an odd viewpoint even if you can think of a million arguments against it. This is not about being a traitor. It's more about not rocking the boat over every little thing. You'll get used to that feeling of surrender today. If nothing else, it's a lot easier than fighting, wouldn't you say?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
