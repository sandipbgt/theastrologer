    "horoscope": "Today is not a day for quiet, low-key activities. If a certain idea or subject catches your interest, you might be satisfied with your nose in a book or scouring the Web, since learning and teaching are highlighted now. But information found in a book is rarely as meaningful to you as the lessons you absorb through experience. So get out into the world and get involved with life, Sadge!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
