    "horoscope": "Time is a strange thing, as you may already be finding out. You're feeling the urge to break with the past, but don't bury it yet. That would be denying how you got here, and your history is a critical piece of who you are. Live vigorously for the future, because that's about who you're still becoming. And strange as this may seem, today you can be in a few places at once. That means it's too soon to shut off any channels radiating from you. Let the moment take you where it will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
