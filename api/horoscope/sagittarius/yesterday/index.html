    "horoscope": "Today you can deepen your understanding of your own inner workings, or perhaps those of a friend or a close relationship. On the surface, it might seem that people are behaving in possessive or jealous ways, but that's only part of the story. What's interesting is what's going on underneath those feelings. Take this chance to act like an investigator. Get curious, and get to the bottom of these sticky emotional situations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
