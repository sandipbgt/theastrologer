    "horoscope": "A traditional approach to, well, just about anything isn't really your style. But today, that's the approach that might work out best in the long run, and it's the long run that you should be concerned with now. Especially if you're dealing with a professional or financial issue, take the tried-and-true route, not the risky, speculative one. You'll be glad later that you did, because unnecessary risks just aren't favored today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
