    "horoscope": "You've always been better with action than with words, and today you might put your foot in your mouth. You try to be honest, but it's hard to talk about your emotions, and sometimes you end up blaming someone else for something that's within your control. You also might indulge today in emotional eating -- trying to fill the void with food. At least this cloudy mood will pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
