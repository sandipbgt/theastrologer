    "horoscope": "Your usual happy-go-lucky demeanor is dimmed slightly today. Worries about your present or future stability are crowding in, demanding your unwilling attention. This is a good time to use your natural flexibility to rise to the challenge. If your relationships or your finances are on shaky ground, ask yourself today what you can do to improve that situation. Listen to your intuition for the answer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
