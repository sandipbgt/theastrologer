    "horoscope": "Aimless wanderings aren't nearly so satisfying today as a focused journey into your own psyche, or a friend's. It's a great day to discuss complex emotions or interpersonal situations. You can give good advice to a friend, or offer them your support in some other way. Better yet, dig into your own feelings. What you find won't scare you. Rather, it's interesting. It reveals more of the mystery of what makes you tick.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
