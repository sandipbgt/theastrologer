    "horoscope": "If your workload increases suddenly today, don't worry. Even if it's a little stressful, you can handle it. Not every day of your life is about fun and excitement, you know. Even if being tied to your desk isn't anywhere close to your idea of a good time, be stoic about it. Remember that this, too, shall pass -- and the sooner you tackle your to-do list, the sooner you'll be free to pursue your own adventures once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
