    "horoscope": "Welcome to a hectic day! You'll probably enjoy having one spirited conversation or debate after another. Just make sure there's an equal information exchange going on. Sometimes you get caught up in sounding off about your ideas and principles. Pretty soon, a chat with a friend becomes less like a two-way discourse and more like a lecture! Listen as much as you talk, and you'll be fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
