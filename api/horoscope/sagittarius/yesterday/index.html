    "horoscope": "Many people's emotions are stirred up today. You might be in a vulnerable spot, yourself, especially if old memories arise in your consciousness. Vivid dreams while you sleep could make you wake up in a cloudy mood. If so, don't ignore it, but don't attach too much importance to it, either. Try to adopt a Zen-like attitude toward your feelings and others', too: Feel them, hear them and accept them. Beautifully simple, isn't it?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
