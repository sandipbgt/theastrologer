    "horoscope": "You're a maverick at heart, which makes today's cosmic energy especially fun. Unique self-expression is favored now. Your best ideas and opportunities will come from being truly  yourself without apology. Unconventional ideas could actually turn out to be groundbreaking -- but only if you voice and act on them. And you never know which of your musings will turn out to be the one that makes things better for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
