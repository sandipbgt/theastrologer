Access your natural optimism and treat any tedious task on your plate as a personal challenge to be fun. How practical can you be in making your plans? How careful can you be in executing them? Cover all your bases and prove it to everyone -- including yourself -- that you're as capable as anyone of detailed work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
