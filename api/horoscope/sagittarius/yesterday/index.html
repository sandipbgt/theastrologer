You could be the one starting the outbreak, or you could just let it flow through you and pass it on. Life is a ready-made party, no matter what kind of chips there are or who volunteers to DJ. Sit back and enjoy the feeling of a room pulsing with happiness. And if the rhythm is so catchy that you can't stand it, get up and dance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
