    "horoscope": "You crave a thrilling lifestyle that's also low-maintenance, but that's probably not going to happen -- not unless you're rich or incredibly lucky. If you're just a regular person, like the rest of us, it's time to work on accepting reality. Once you do that, you'll realize that your daily life isn't all that mundane after all. And if it is, it's within your power to liven things up. Just do so within the bounds of reason.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
