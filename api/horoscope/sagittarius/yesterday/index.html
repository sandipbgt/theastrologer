But if you take the time to seek out the right people and discuss with them a subject that's important to you, this could actually focus your energy and attention on what matters. Gather ideas from other creative minds, and keep thinking and talking today. Later on, you can figure out what it all means.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
