    "horoscope": "Your curiosity is boundless today. Focus your bright, brimming mind toward a particular problem or project. Especially if you work with other people, you're sure to come up with some exciting stuff. And you won't let petty ego concerns get in the way. You don't care now about recognition for your brilliance. You just care about what happens when a group of great minds come together and start producing ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
