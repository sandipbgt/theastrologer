    "horoscope": "An affectionate mood settles in today. Express warm, loving feelings in concrete ways. Give someone a gift or a back rub. Even small items that cost you nothing serve as a reminder of your connection. If you need a prompt yourself, the same concept applies. Carry a small object, like a rock or a bead, that serves as a lucky charm. This keeps you grounded and focused on your goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
