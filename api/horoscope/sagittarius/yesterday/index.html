    "horoscope": "You were in a slump for a while. Now you have a chance to become your dynamic self again. Remember how this works? It's about taking personal chances. Be candid with your truths even if some people don't want to know. Be generous with your abundance, reaching out to the people who usually get left out instead. For today you can give without fear of losing. Sure, your supply might dwindle down to nothing, but you'll feel better knowing it's for a good cause. And you'll always get back what you need as long as you keep the faith.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
