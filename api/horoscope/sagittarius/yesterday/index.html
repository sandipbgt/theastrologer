But stretch yourself outside your usual way of doing things today. Make the effort to prepare for a project before it's actually underway. This may seem silly or tedious, but once you've gotten things going, you may find you're glad you put in extra time up front. It makes the process so much easier!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
