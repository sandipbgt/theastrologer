    "horoscope": "Stay focused but don't bore everyone with a steady drone. Add a dash of spice. Maybe get a little sassy or edgy just to keep them all awake. Show off on many different levels to hold their attention. Express yourself through actions as well as words. Put a little spin on your story so that it won't get tangled up with anybody else's. It's your day to really and truly make your point. But don't kill the conversation by turning up the volume. The secret to being a team player or an attractive force is making others feel special, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
