    "horoscope": "You love learning and teaching. But today you might get so caught up in your principles that you're no longer teaching anyone -- or learning anything, yourself. That's the very definition of closed-minded. And that just isn't your nature, Sag. You're all about open-mindedness, seeking truth and expanding your vision. Keep those in mind as objectives today. Challenge yourself to break out of your own mental limits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
