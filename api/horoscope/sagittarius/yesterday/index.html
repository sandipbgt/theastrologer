    "horoscope": "Usually, your focus is turned outward -- way outward, toward the horizons of your life. But today is a good day to bring your attention to matters closer to home. Work or family responsibilities may call out to you. In some way, you need to buckle down. Optimism and ingenuity are wonderful gifts, but in many areas of life, hard work is the only thing that keeps you going.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
