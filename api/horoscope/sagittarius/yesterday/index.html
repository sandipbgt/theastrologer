Even a conservative approach is better than some high-flying idea that may or may not work out. The emphasis right now is on practicality and efficiency, so just for today, minimize the risks you take. Especially in professional or financial matters, it's better to be sure-footed as you move forward.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
