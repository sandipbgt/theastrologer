    "horoscope": "You'll enjoy your day most if you get to spend it with other people. Even at the office, you'll linger over thecooler or in the break room, chatting and laughing with your work mates. If you have a chance to be social, so much the better. Mingling with your fellow humans feeds your energy and your good mood. Right now, anyone and everyone seems interesting!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
