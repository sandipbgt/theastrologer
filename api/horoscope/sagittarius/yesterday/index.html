    "horoscope": "You're brooding, which is a truly unusual event in your life. But you've picked a good time for some self-reflection. A deep look inside never hurt anyone, especially when it doesn't happen often, as in your case. Take a quiet day for yourself -- and don't blame others for your problems. Remember that you're the key to every single situation in your life. You'll come out of this understanding yourself and others better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
