    "horoscope": "It's easy today to tap into your favorite vibe -- that friendly, creative energy that really gets you going. Everywhere you find yourself, you're sure to find a friend. Be as open and warm as you want. It's a great day for creative work, especially group efforts. Social events, lunch with a close friend or helping your child make artwork you can hang up on the refrigerator -- these simple things bring great satisfaction.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
