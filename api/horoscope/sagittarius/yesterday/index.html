    "horoscope": "A wonderfully inclusive sense of togetherness infuses the world today. You feel free to join any group or movement. The only trouble is deciding which one! There are so many creative projects and important causes you could throw yourself into. It almost doesn't matter which you choose, as long as you choose one. Wherever you decide to direct your energy, you're sure to make a positive difference, and that's the important thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
