You know, 'getting serious' doesn't have to mean mind-numbing drudgery. You possess unique gifts, so be upfront about what you can do. Your clients or employer might be very interested in these previously unknown facets of your genius. Still, don't be surprised if it's another couple of days before you see results. Other people want to be sure of what they're getting into. Give them time to weigh everything out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
