    "horoscope": "Your principles have always mattered a great deal to you. Perhaps more than most, you have a strong sense of what's important to you. Today, those values may be called into question, or at least into the spotlight. If so, do your best to avoid asserting them in an overly opinionated way. Yours isn't the only point of view in the room. You could learn a good lesson today in being open-minded.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
