    "horoscope": "At the end of the day, you may feel as if you lost time to wishy-washy feelings and perceptions. But let yourself off the hook. You may not get a lot accomplished today, at least not on the outside. But inside, your emotions are developing. Give yourself time to make sense of the images and feelings that come to you now. Soon, they may provide more inspiration than you expected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
