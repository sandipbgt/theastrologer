    "horoscope": "Often, your focus is broad, or even scattered. But today you'll find it much easier than usual to narrow your scope. Concentration comes more easily, as well. Take advantage of this influence while it lasts! Get absorbed in a subject of your choice. Do research. Chase down loose ends and find their origins. If a problem arises, don't avoid it. Face it straight on. You're sure to learn something about yourself in the process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
