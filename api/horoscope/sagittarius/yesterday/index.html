    "horoscope": "Today might be a lot of talk but very little action. You're full of ideas, but the motivation it takes to carry them out is a separate issue. Why not use today to plan a project? You can network with supportive people and brainstorm creative ideas. Toss strategies around, and don't limit yourself to mundane concerns like practicality or available resources. That can come later. For now, just let your mind run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
