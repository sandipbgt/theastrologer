    "horoscope": "Your innate idealism could go overboard today. You're operating on dreams and fantasies, and you believe in them wholeheartedly. And blind faith can be a powerful force. But if a friend or coworker advises you against a certain path or decision, take their word for it. They probably have a more realistic sense of things than you do at the moment. It's best to temper your idealism with common sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
