Isn't it wonderful to get so absorbed in intellectual work? You're stimulating your brain and challenging yourself to think outside the box. You may end up discovering a brand-new interest, or something unexpected about a subject you thought you knew well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
