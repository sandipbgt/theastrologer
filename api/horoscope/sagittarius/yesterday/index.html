    "horoscope": "Today your personal heat is easily diffused. Maybe that's because you're so cool, but you shouldn't have to work at that when there's so much else going on in your life. Concentrate your efforts. Be open to new tools and ideas that will help you, and be honest about the type of compensation you're expecting for all this. Don't sell yourself short when you're this valuable. Remember, there's always someone else who will appreciate you more. And if you weren't so honest and committed, you might even go find them. Hopefully everybody here understands this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
