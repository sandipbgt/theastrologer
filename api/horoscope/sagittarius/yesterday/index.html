    "horoscope": "The party continues today -- at least, it does as long as you're around, making everyone laugh and tune in to the conversation. Expect some lively, interesting gatherings, whether planned or impromptu. Actually, you love the spontaneous get-togethers best, since they heighten the mood and give you a sense of adventure. So keep your eyes and ears open, and head wherever the lights are bright and the noise seems festive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
