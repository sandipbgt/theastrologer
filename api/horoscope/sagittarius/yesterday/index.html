Schedule in some time at the gym, so you can work on improving your strength, balance and coordination. Next, turn an honest eye toward your work, and see if you can make any needed changes or improvements. There. Doesn't that feel better?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
