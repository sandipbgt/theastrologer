    "horoscope": "Enjoy today's mellow pace. It's a good time to connect with friends and family, especially if food is involved. Breaking bread with loved ones brings you back to basics, such as the fact that physical nourishment -- a good, wholesome meal -- is essential to your well-being. It's a great day for affection, too. Find a creative way to connect with others. Or, luxuriate on your own with a long nap or a hot bath.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
