    "horoscope": "Life could feel somewhat limiting today. Sure, you have to work hard to get where you're going; that's not the problem. The problem is all the red tape involved in the process! Your challenge, then, is to find liberation in following the rules. It might only come once you've jumped through all the hoops, proven yourself, and achieved your goal. Until then, all your hard work is a means to an end.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
