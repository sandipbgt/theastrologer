    "horoscope": "Take a journey today into the darker regions of your own heart. Explore your deepest feelings and urges. This will take great honesty -- with yourself and anyone else involved -- regarding how you feel and what you need. Your feelings may not be pretty, but at least they're yours, and they're real. And if you feel them instead of ignoring them, they can pass through you like a river on its way out to sea.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
