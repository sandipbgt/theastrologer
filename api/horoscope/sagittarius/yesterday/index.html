    "horoscope": "You're in an idealistic frame of mind, and your current thoughts, goals and decisions will influence the course of your near future. Start thinking about what you want to accomplish in the next few weeks, months or even years. What personal intentions can you make for your future? Think about that today, and take notes. Writing them down makes you more likely to make them a reality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
