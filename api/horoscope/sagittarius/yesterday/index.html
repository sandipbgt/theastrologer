    "horoscope": "You tend to avoid restrictions and limitations whenever possible. But today is all about dealing with constraints. You may have to live up to the high standards of your employer, or stick to a certain routine when you'd much rather do your own thing. But you'll find that following the rules actually saves you time and effort. And don't worry -- life should loosen up again in just a day or two.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
