You might think you're as open as they come -- but remember, true intelligence is knowing how little you really know. Instead of showering people with your brilliant philosophies -- which really are genius -- try listening to theirs instead. Someone could open a whole new window to the universe for you, if you just tune in with an open mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
