    "horoscope": "Hey, what just happened? It's as if the sky opened up and showered you with whatever wealth or resources you were craving. No, you're not imagining it. All this abundance is for real. But that doesn't mean your struggles are over. It means that you're now a lot closer to the top in your uphill battle. It means that hoping won't seem like such a waste of time any more. Today is the day to manifest your ideals, whether that will involve making peace with your enemies or with yourself. Don't waste another second. Time flies when you're winning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
