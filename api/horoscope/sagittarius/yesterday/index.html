    "horoscope": "It's a good day to relax and enjoy your friends. You're in an easygoing mood, and you're certainly in the right frame of mind for company. Your own ego needs aren't very strong now. You don't really mind where you go to dinner or which movie you see. For you, the main point is to spend time together. So let the other person choose the activity and venue, and follow along for the ride.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
