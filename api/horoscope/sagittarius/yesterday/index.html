    "horoscope": "Being detail-oriented probably doesn't come naturally to you,-- you're much more of a big-picture person. But today you may have to morph into a perfectionist at the office or at home. Whatever's on your plate, your close attention is needed, along with your ability to brainstorm new approaches to existing problems. Don't waste time trying to hide from your responsibilities -- simply narrow your focus and get to work. It'll make life much easier for everyone involved.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
