    "horoscope": "Your curiosity is one of your best traits, and one that leads you down many different paths of learning. Today you prefer a traditional, scholarly approach. You whip quickly through essays, information and manuals. You'll tire soon of book learning, though. Why not put those manuals aside and test things for yourself? Soon you'll be too busy to run such experiments, so do it today, while you've got the mind and the time for it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
