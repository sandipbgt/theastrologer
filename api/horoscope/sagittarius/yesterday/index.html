    "horoscope": "Change excites you. You're full of a funny, odd energy today, and you feel sparky and ready for just about anything. Of course, this means a certain amount of 'fly by the seat of your pants' spontaneity, which is fine with you. You adore going wherever the wind blows. But others may find you a little too chaotic. Try to be more aware of how you affect others and pay attention to your surroundings. Maybe tone it down a little, and work some solid trustworthiness into your current enthusiasm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
