One way to do this is to share your stories, even if you think they're a little on the private side. Other people can really benefit from your experiences, because they'll know you're human too -- and that they aren't alone. And getting old burdens off your chest will make you feel lighter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
