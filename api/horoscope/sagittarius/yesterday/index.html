    "horoscope": "You're always searching for something -- knowledge, experience, adventure. Maybe all three at once. And today, you might just find what you seek. You're perceptive, as if you've been gifted with temporary x-ray vision. Other people's behavior is suddenly crystal-clear to you. You're laughing to yourself in sheer joy at how things have snapped into focus. But just because you have an insider's view of the workings of the universe, don't hold it over other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
