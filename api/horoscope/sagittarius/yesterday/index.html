    "horoscope": "Today you could be a creature of lust. Your brain might not be the boss when your body makes such a convincing argument. Don't get too lazy, though. Prepare for possible frustration even as you dwell on your chances for success. High self-esteem is useful until you slide over the line into arrogance. Sure, you're the hottest thing for miles, but you can't always have your way here. Other people have their own preferences and commitments and lives. Respect them for who they are, not for who you want them to be. Maybe then you'll start seeing some results.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
