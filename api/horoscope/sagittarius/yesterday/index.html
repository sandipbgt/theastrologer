    "horoscope": "You're feeling slow today, but the good news is this is actually making you impatient. You know in your heart that it's time to stop bellyaching and dragging yourself around, and get out there and accomplish something. All you have to do is motivate yourself, and a fresh start could really take you far today. Maybe knowing that will be motivation enough for you to pick yourself up, focus on a goal and get to work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
