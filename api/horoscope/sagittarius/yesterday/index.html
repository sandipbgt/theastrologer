You'll be among your equals today, and that works both ways. It doesn't have to be a contest now that everyone knows they'd be good for each other in any possible combination. Somebody here might give you the best gift in the world. If you see anything like that coming, open your arms wide to receive it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
