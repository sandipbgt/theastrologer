    "horoscope": "'Routine' might be one of your least favorite words. You can't stand feeling boxed in, whether by an idea, an expectation or some external structure. But today, these very things matter more than usual. And your best bet is simply to play along. Honor your commitments. Show up on time to meetings and appointments. Prove to everyone -- including yourself -- that you can manage this level of life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
