    "horoscope": "You may notice that other people seem more emotional than usual today. And you have no interest in getting caught up in their drama! But if there's been tension in one of your relationships, this could be a good day to address it. Your own emotions are stirred up now, too. That means you'll speak from the heart on matters that are important to you. Think of this as a journey into your own feelings,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
