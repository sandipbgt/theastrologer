    "horoscope": "Creative imagery abounds today. This may even begin while you're asleep, in your dreams. If you remember them upon waking, write them down. It's likely that they're full of symbolic meaning that you could use either in a creative project or to gain a deeper level of self-awareness. If you work in a creative field, the current energy could be both positive and challenging. It's hard to stay focused!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
