    "horoscope": "Your idealistic nature is up and you see the world for its possibilities, not its limitations. Maybe you're a bit impractical; but right now, who cares? Today, your charm will far outshine your mistakes. And they've just been a good way to learn, anyway. Get some mileage out of your ability to win people over and revel in your energy. Launch something wonderful now. This could be the start of a really great time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
