    "horoscope": "Your mind is stimulated today. You might even feel lightheaded from all the interesting ideas blazing through your mind! It's a great day for adventure, whether that means getting out of town and exploring someplace new, or launching an exploration into a subject that's fresh and fascinating. Whatever you end up doing, it's got to be something that allows you to toss expectations out the window so you can stretch your own limits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
