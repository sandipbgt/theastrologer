But whether this is a date, a job offer or just a wild goose chase, vibrant personalities like you can't sit still for too long. In the end you'll probably say, 'Yes, let's get out there and stir things up.' Here's a key point: try to make a difference instead of just making trouble. Direct action is sure to take you places today. Make sure they're places you're genuinely eager to go. Otherwise, you'll kick yourself wishing you'd waited for a better offer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
