    "horoscope": "The intensity of life itself ramps up today to a higher level. Your emotions are strong. You might have increased insight into other people and their feelings, too. That, in turn, feeds your compassion. After all, we're all human. You understand this basic, fundamental truth better than many. So while plenty of folks are getting all worked up today, you're able to chuckle at the divine comedy of life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
