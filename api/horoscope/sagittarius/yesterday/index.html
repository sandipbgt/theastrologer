Your best bet is to laugh off any sticky situations that arise, and tap into the passionate side of this energy. This can be romantic or creative passion, or even passion for a book you're reading or a course you're taking. It's up to you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
