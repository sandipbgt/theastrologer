    "horoscope": "Today your mind is alive. Ideas are plentiful, and you're interested in everyone you encounter. Intellectually, you're on-- but you want  human contact. So talk, laugh, share ideas and debate. You want to be around your fellow humans. So gather with them, whether for work or for play. Start trading those ideas, and see what develops when you get several bright minds together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
