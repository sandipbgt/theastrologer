    "horoscope": "Don't just sit there. Don't hang around like a flag waiting for a breeze. You're way too vital to let yourself get that boring. Anyway, don't you have some loose ends to tie up? Isn't there an empire somewhere you should be building? Stay generous with your energy and hope for a feedback loop. Make everyone your friend today so that you'll get back some of what you're putting out. Set these people onwith your vision and intellect. Once they see just how cool you are, they'll be knocking on your door and filling your inbox.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
