    "horoscope": "If you get up in the morning and feel like putting some extra effort into your appearance, go right ahead. And if you're proud of your recent accomplishments, it's okay to talk about what you've achieved. A little vanity can't hurt you today. It's not coming from a place of conceit, but from a genuine appreciation of the world. And that world includes you, Sadge. You feel blissfully a part of the universe, and your good humor draws people your way. Lighten up and appreciate life. Let the good things find you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
