    "horoscope": "Stay active today. Of course, you probably don't have to be told twice. Your mind is soaring like a bird, and your body wants to follow wherever it leads! So let yourself wander. Court exciting, adventurous experiences. You crave personal and intellectual freedom now more than ever, so avoid restrictive situations as well as people with narrow-minded attitudes. Spend time with folks who appreciate your idealistic, inquisitive outlook.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
