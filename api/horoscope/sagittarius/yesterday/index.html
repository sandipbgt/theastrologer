You're the big-picture type, but today you're just going to have to take a deep breath and deal with the little stuff. This might feel like torture, or at least incredibly irritating, but later you'll be glad you did. Oh, well. Sometimes, you just have to do things you don't want to do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
