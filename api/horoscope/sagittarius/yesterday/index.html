You bring an optimistic energy that lifts the spirits of everyone present. This is a real gift when you're tackling a difficult issue, or even just when you have a dull business meeting on the agenda. It's more fun for everyone when it feels less like drudgery and more like play.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
