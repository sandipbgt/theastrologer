    "horoscope": "Maybe you're not a huge fan of moderation, but surely even you can see there are limits. Be tactful today. Politely appear to believe someone even if their story has holes big enough to drive a truck through. Because once you start to ask all the penetrating, merciless questions on the tip of your tongue, people will expect you to start shedding light on things that you'd prefer to keep hidden. That's why you need to keep in mind that reputations -- especially yours -- are riding on how well or badly you behave. So be better than good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
