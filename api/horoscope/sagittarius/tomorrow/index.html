Why can't they just loosen and lighten up a little? Of course, there's a time and a place for everything. And today, it's time for a sober approach to your responsibilities. Focus helps you get the details right the first time. That way, you don't have to redo them later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
