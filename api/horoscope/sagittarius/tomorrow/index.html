    "horoscope": "When it comes to talking about your ideas, feelings and plans, you aren't naturally very discreet. You see no reason to hold back, even in mixed company. But today, it's a good idea to keep at least some things private. Maybe you're developing some plans that aren't fully formed yet, or you're processing your reaction to a situation at work. Talk openly with people you trust implicitly, but draw the line there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
