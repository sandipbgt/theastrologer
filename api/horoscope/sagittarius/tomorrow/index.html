    "horoscope": "Life is a little more sober now than you'd prefer, but that doesn't mean you should hide or run away from your duties. If you expect some friction between the material and spiritual sides of life, you won't be surprised by the anxious mood some people seem to have slipped into. You have a knack for lifting everyone's spirits with your carefree, goodhearted energy. Still, this brief period isn't for acting silly or shirking your responsibilities. Take a little break from consumer culture. Some hard work or quiet contemplation will do you good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
