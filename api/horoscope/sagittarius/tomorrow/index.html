    "horoscope": "Life could get a little confusing today. Like most people, you're experiencing the world at an entirely subjective level. That makes it hard to be objective or rational! It's a great day to stay close to home and loved ones. Wandering afar or spending too much time alone could lead to feelings of anxiety. This is one of those rare days when you need the comfort of familiar faces and places.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
