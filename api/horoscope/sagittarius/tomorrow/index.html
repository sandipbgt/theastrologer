    "horoscope": "Be more sensitive today than usual. You don't want to say anything tactless to someone you love. You didn't mean to hurt their feelings, but everyone's feeling a little moody today -- including you. Vulnerability and sensitivity are issues now for everyone, so tread lightly, especially with the people you care about most. And if you do hurt someone's feelings, there's nothing like a simple, heartfelt apology and a hug to repair the damage.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
