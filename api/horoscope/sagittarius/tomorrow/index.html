    "horoscope": "Your mind might feel like a pinball machine today. Your thoughts are here, there and everywhere. Focusing on one activity could be impossible! If so, roll with it. Being flexible is your forte, after all. Instead of trying to stick to one mind-numbing task, diversify. Schedule several quick errands, meetings or phone calls. If you have to work on just one project, brainstorming could be a fun way to mix it up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
