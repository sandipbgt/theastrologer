    "horoscope": "Suddenly it's all push, push, push. When you're this driven, it almost doesn't matter who's doing the driving. But even crazy workaholics have to look at the big picture. A rigid schedule could mean sloppy work, in which case, what's the point? You can't just shrug and walk away from it all, you know. The real world demands that you stay and fix these mistakes today. Then you can move on, hopefully at a slower pace and with less noise. Don't be shy if you really want these things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
