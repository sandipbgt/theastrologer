To you, it looks a lot like nitpicking when someone tells you to go back and snip off a loose end you skipped over -- one that didn't really matter in the first place, in your opinion. But that's the thing about the current influence: Details count. Do your best to take care of them the first time around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
