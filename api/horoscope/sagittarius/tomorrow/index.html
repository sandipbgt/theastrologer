    "horoscope": "You're plainspoken and friendly. That's just part of your honest, sunny personality, today more than ever. You're even more charming and magnetic now than usual, and you're feeling confident in your ability to attract people to your corner. If you're trying to get a new relationship or project off the ground, you'll have luck during this brief period. After all, new beginnings have to start somewhere. Why not with you?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
