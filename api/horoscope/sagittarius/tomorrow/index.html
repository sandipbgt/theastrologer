    "horoscope": "You're in your element today, and you've got energy to burn. Your enthusiasm is infectious! Everywhere you go, you'll inspire other people to adopt the same sense of excitement for life itself that you're exhibiting. It's a great day to launch a new endeavor, because you have the vision, the ambition and the determination to give it a real push. If it's a big job, it shouldn't be difficult to recruit friends' or coworkers' assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
