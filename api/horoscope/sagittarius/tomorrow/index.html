Your appetite for everything -- romance, thrills, life itself -- is huge today. You want to rush out and gobble up the world! Is there anything proactive you can do with all this positive energy? You could just use it for fun, but why not put it to work?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
