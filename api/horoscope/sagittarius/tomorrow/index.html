    "horoscope": "Keep all your deals aboveboard. Acting kindly might not be a bad idea, either. Because who wants to get hauled before a judge or an ethics committee? OK, maybe that's extreme, but it's still a good idea to be strong and restrain yourself today. It'll be a lot harder avoiding the bad stuff than surrendering to temptation. But instead of dwelling on self-denial, think about the good behavior you're modeling. You have to admit that self-control looks pretty cool in an out-of-control world. And after you're out of the danger zone, you'll be free to cut loose again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
