Group effort is favored now, and you'll find that working closely with other people toward a common goal truly yields great results. If nothing else, it reminds you that you aren't alone in this world. So ask a neighbor to pitch in on a landscaping project, or recruit coworkers to help you brainstorm a proposal. Get people involved, and build that community glow!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
