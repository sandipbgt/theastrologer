You know what you believe in terms of right and wrong. Or do you? Now, circumstances put your principles to the test. You may find that some of your ideas don't hold up to a reality check. If so, it's okay. That's where learning and progress come in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
