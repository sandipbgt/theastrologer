    "horoscope": "Your genuine, sunny nature will excuse any screw-ups you happen to make today. People will love you for your brash honesty and total clarity. They might even cut you a little more slack than usual in exchange for one of your trademark charming apologies. It's good that you have these skills and know how to use them, but it would be a mistake to base your plans on the kindness of strangers. Know when to stop pushing your luck and start pulling your weight.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
