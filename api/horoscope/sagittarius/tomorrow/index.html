    "horoscope": "Sometimes you get stuck in your opinions, don't you? This could be one of those times. A good idea turns into little more than dogma, and next thing you know, you're annoying the very people you're trying to impress. Well, you can't help it if you're feeling blindly stubborn, can you? Those could even seem like good qualities now -- at least, to you. Your audience, however, may feel a little miffed that you refuse to listen to their views. Oh, well. Later, you'll be more open to other views.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
