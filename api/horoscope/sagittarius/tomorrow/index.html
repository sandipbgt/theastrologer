You bring a lot to any group, especially now, with your fresh ideas and unique perspective. So find your people and join with them. Talk, trade ideas and communicate about interesting or important subjects. Most of all, enjoy the intellectual interchange, and prepare to learn something valuable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
