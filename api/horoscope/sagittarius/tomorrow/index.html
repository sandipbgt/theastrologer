    "horoscope": "Throwing yourself into helping someone else is a great way to distract yourself from your own confusing feelings today. If you spend too much time alone now, you're likely to slip into a fretful state of mind -- no fun for anyone, but especially not for someone as upbeat as you generally are. So direct your gaze away from your navel and toward someone else. By tomorrow, you'll be feeling much more like yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
