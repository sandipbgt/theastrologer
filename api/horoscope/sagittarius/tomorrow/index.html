If you focus on bettering the world in some way, you stand to create something truly meaningful. But even if you just use this energy to connect with your fellow humans, you're making a difference. Everyone could use an interesting, inspiring friend like you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
