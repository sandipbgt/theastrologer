    "horoscope": "You're a quick study, since you're full of energy and excited to use your skills. So you're happy to do an honest day's work. And everyone loves you, professionally and personally. Sure, you won't always be this optimistic and energetic. But you can retain a sense of what it feels like to be so tuned in, interested, and appreciated. The next time you feel listless or bored, just remember today, and you'll feel rejuvenated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
