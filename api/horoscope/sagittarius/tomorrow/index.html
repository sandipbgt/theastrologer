    "horoscope": "It's a slow day, which isn't really your style. Still, you can appreciate the friendly, mellow vibe that seems to have taken over the people around you. It's easier to enjoy everyone's company when people are feeling relaxed and friendly. If you have to get a lot of work done, you'll find it's easier than usual to focus. That gets boring fast, though. Plan for an afterwork gathering with friends to lighten things up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
