    "horoscope": "Today brings energy, movement, learning and teaching. A friendship or love affair could blossom or move to an exciting new level. You'll explore these inner realms with zest and vigor. Enjoy being both the master and the student. This heady mixture of giving and receiving feels absolutely wonderful now, but be mindful of the first impression you make on others. Tact is still appreciated, even in moments of great passion. After all, a hearty appetite shouldn't eclipse good manners.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
