    "horoscope": "Today, your main goal should be outward bound. Remember, there's more than one way to achieve this. If an actual trip out of town isn't possible right now, be creative! You could make your own adventure-scape in your back yard, or watch a documentary about deep-sea diving. You could even get online and start gathering facts about a future trip you might take.
