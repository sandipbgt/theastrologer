Pay attention to mundane tasks and routines, such as the way you keep track of paid and unpaid bills. If you don't have a system, put one in place today. Consider the most efficient way to get the job done. This applies to just about anything you might do now. Smart shortcuts and moneysaving techniques are favored.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
