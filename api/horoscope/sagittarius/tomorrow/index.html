    "horoscope": "Your optimism and confidence are on high today. You trust in your own perspective. At the very least, you trust in your ability to question the truth, which is hugely important. But watch yourself when you're discussing big ideas with other people. It's easy for your excitement to appear to others as a know-it-all attitude. Let them state their truths, too, even if they differ from yours. That's real democracy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
