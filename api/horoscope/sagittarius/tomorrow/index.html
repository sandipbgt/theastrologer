    "horoscope": "Normally you're all about freedom, even in personal relationships. You want to do your own thing, and you're happy for your partner to do the same. But today, you're feeling a little possessive of their time and energy. The key here is not to take these feelings too seriously. Don't deny them or bottle them up, which will only make them more intense. But recognize that they're just feelings, and will pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
