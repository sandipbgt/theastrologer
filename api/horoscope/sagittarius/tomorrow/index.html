Strike a balance today between being active and laying low. The current energy is both grounding and motivating, so spend the morning working quietly toward a long-term goal. Then get some endurance-based exercise in the afternoon, such as a long walk or run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
