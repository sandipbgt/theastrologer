Spend some time at home today, Sagittarius, or holed up in your office or workshop. There's no need to take part if you don't feel like it. Maybe there's someone who knows how to connect by more subtle means? Just don't expect to resolve any uncomfortable situations today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
