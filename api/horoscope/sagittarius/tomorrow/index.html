    "horoscope": "You have an easy-come, easy-go relationship with money, but today it's important to take a more direct approach to holding on to the money you have. Look into lucrative job opportunities or research savings strategies, but in some way, get more serious about your relationship with your resources. The future is coming soon, you know. Providing for yourself and your family may be tedious, but it's a smart move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
