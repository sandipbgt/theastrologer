Connecting with art is one good way to do this, whether you're creating your own or appreciating someone else's. Of course, if you have a long task list that needs to be completed, you may have to resign yourself to a day of all work and no play. Let's hope you can schedule in at least a few minutes of downtime.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
