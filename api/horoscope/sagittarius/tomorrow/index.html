    "horoscope": "Yesterday's big, brilliant ideas are old news today. Your thinking is no longer sharp, clear and clever; instead, it's freeform and impressionistic at best. But rest assured, this is a rich, creative field just waiting to be mined. Your dreams and fantasies are especially revealing -- those moments when you're operating on instinct instead of intellect. Don't discount your own insights, Sagittarius. Feel your way along today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
