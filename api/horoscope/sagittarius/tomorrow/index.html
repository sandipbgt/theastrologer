    "horoscope": "You could experience a few emotional ups and downs today. Though usually you're brimming with energy, ready to strike out into the world and gobble it up, you feel a little like a homebody now. Don't fight this; embrace it. Stay home and bake some cookies. Call your friends and invite them over to enjoy the sweet comfort food you just whipped up. Your usual positive outlook will return soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
