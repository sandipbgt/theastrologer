    "horoscope": "Your inner ham comes out to play today. You love making people laugh with funny stories and silly faces. Especially if you work with children or have your own, you'll keep them in stitches all day long! This is your true nature shining out. Don't forget to add a dash of elegance if you're out this evening with friends or someone special. Just because you're youthful doesn't mean you can't appeal to adults, too!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
