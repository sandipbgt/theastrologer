    "horoscope": "Creativity abounds today. If you feel the urge to create some imaginative work of your own, you'll have the vision as well as the determination needed to get it started. You're also drawn to artistic people and places. You crave that imaginative stimulation, so spend time with friends who are into music or the arts, or visit a museum or gallery. Invite your muse out to explore the world with you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
