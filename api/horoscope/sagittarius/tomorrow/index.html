    "horoscope": "The world seems to be making urgent demands. How is this different from usual? Well, for one thing, if you're feeling weak or persecuted, it's going to be a lot worse. Fear will loosen your tongue, and you'll hear yourself say some amazing things as it wags. Divine revelations, brilliant thought gems, stupid jokes -- it's all there. The people around you will be the ones who decide if you're a prophet or a windbag. Today you might be a bit of both. You'll win, sort of, if you can laugh at yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
