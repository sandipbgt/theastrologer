    "horoscope": "As much as you enjoy meeting new people, sometimes you need the comfort of a familiar face. Today, the sight of your best friend, spouse or even your favorite pet warms your heart. No, you aren't losing your edge. You just need a little time at home to rest and regroup! You can get back out there when you're feeling restored. For now, take it easy. Reconnect with the people you love.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
