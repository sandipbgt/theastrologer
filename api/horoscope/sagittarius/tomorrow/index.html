Either way, it's a good time to connect with your loved ones or spend time in familiar places, even if just in your dreams. Think of this as a chance to recharge your energy, so you can go back out into the world with renewed vigor and enthusiasm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
