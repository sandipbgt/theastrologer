    "horoscope": "If you're alone now, it could be by choice. Maybe you don't like what other people are doing. Maybe you have nothing in common with anyone in your neighborhood. Wanderlust will drag you out of your seat today, spiriting you away to be the guest of honor at a party of one. But there's no guarantee it'll be all fun and games. How prepared are you for a challenge? You might be anxious and emotional, and who would you turn to then? Why not accept your adventures as they come? You'll be OK.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
