Of course, if you truly think you're putting in good effort but reaching zero results, it may be time to rethink your approach. Perhaps it's time to focus on strengthening your foundation. Usually, when a relationship or a project isn't working out, it's because some core issue needs to be addressed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
