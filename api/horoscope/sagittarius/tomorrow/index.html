    "horoscope": "You've never been closed-minded, but today you're seeing matters in a truly fresh light. A different angle, a shifted perspective, a mirage you can't quite put your finger on -- you're not quite sure what it is, but something has changed. Dive into this new vision. Explore, expand and improve upon it. Take advantage of any opportunities that come up, as long as they make sense for your grand vision of the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
