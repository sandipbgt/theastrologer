    "horoscope": "Are you having trouble regulating your energy output? It's as if your internal engine is revving but your wheels are just spinning out, accomplishing nothing. Maybe it's a communication issue. It's great that you're so fearless and unapologetic about expressing your opinions, but people don't tend to appreciate moralistic preaching. Don't expect any applause if all you're doing is telling others how they should and shouldn't live their lives. In fact, you're better off sticking to well-known loved ones -- the people who know and appreciate you for who you are, and who can overlook your quirks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
