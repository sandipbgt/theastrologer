    "horoscope": "You're extra good-humored today. That's good, because life slows its pace, which could get under your skin if you let it. Instead, take this day for what it is: a brief respite after a burst of high energy. Catch up on busy work or R and R. Mundane activities like paying bills or filing papers might bore you to tears, but at least you have the focus for them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
