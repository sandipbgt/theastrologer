    "horoscope": "Being as smart as you are actually has some drawbacks, including the fact that sometimes, like today, you can be inflexible in your opinions. You're narrow-minded on certain subjects, and the people around you, including friends, family and coworkers, don't appreciate this attitude. They'd love for you to open up to a new perspective.
