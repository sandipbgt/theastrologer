    "horoscope": "Don't be critical today, of yourself or anyone else. If you do start feeling disgruntled, stop and consider whether you're making opportunities or enemies. Unfortunately, the latter is more likely. Good thing you realize you both need and want other people's support and friendship in life. Watch what you say and how you say it, so you don't make a stranger of a former friend. Your allies are too important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
