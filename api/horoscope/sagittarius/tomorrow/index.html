    "horoscope": "You want to greet the day with your usual excitement and optimism, but someone near you is being overly emotional -- or maybe you're the one who's feeling all stirred up. It's easy now to get discouraged, especially if you feel confused about your goals or a project you've been considering taking on. Don't push yourself to be very focused or active today. Just take it easy, and enjoy the imaginative ideas that come your way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
