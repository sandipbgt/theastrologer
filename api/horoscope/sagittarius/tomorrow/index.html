    "horoscope": "You might feel alone today, even if you're in a relationship or surrounded by people. Your closest connections could seem a little off at the moment. This may be because you're not clear yourself about the bond you share with someone, or it may simply be an uncomfortable but passing mood. Do be honest with yourself about your true feelings, but don't give in to pessimistic thinking. Draw on your natural optimism, Sagittarius.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
