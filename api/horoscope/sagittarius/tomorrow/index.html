Tackle your to-do list, and enjoy the sense of accomplishment as you finish all those items and tasks. That way, it won't seem so boring to work such long hours. Be sure to reward yourself at the end of the day with good food and company.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
