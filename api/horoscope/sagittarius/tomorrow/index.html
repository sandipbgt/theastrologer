If there's something you're sad or worried about, let the emotion sink in. It won't overwhelm you. In fact, the sooner you feel it fully, the sooner it will evaporate. Then you'll be back in fighting form, and you can go tackle the world once again!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
