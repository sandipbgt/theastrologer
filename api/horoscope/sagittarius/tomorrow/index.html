    "horoscope": "The idea of steady, focused effort may not appeal to you today -- too restrictive -- but that should be your goal anyway. The current energy is the kind that pushes you to do the responsible thing, even if you'd rather toss your duties to the wind. Find a reason you can believe in to work hard. Do it for the people you love, or simply to prove to yourself that you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
