    "horoscope": "Make yourself comfortable during itchy, edgy times. You'll be in an odd position today, and you probably don't want to feel trapped there. Don't worry if you look a little silly. Someone will always laugh no matter what, and there's nothing you can do about it. What you should worry about is finding the right inspiration and making the right calls. Have faith in your choices. Otherwise you might amplify the wrong thing with your big energy, and then looking silly would be the least of your troubles. Ideally, you should be laughing with everyone so they're not laughing at you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
