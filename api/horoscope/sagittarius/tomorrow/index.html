    "horoscope": "You might like it best when your mind -- and your feet -- are free to wander, but today, stay on a specific path. Instead of casting your mental net far and wide, try going deep. Delve into a particular subject in conversation, or study one aspect of a theory that you're interested in. When you bring this type of focus to your mental pursuits, you'll be amazed at what you learn.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
