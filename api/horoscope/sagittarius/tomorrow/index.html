It might be surprising, then, to learn that even your smarts might not bring success in a project that you're working on. Maybe you're trying too hard, or going at it from the wrong angle. Or maybe you need to make sure you know who you're dealing with. Whatever's going on, it's clear that this issue deserves more consideration.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
