    "horoscope": "It's a great day for social gatherings. You're especially attuned to art and creativity today. Visiting a gallery or museum would be a lot of fun, and it would get your mind functioning at that imaginative level. But any group of people offers you excellent networking opportunities. There's so much energy to be found in a crowd. You certainly know how to keep everyone laughing and tuned in!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
