You also appreciate the equally important yet intangible plane of love, spirit and emotion. This mysterious realm is yours to wander today. Let your soul take you where it will, and enjoy the experience. As long as you remain true to yourself, it won't lead you astray.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
