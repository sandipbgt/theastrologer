    "horoscope": "It's important to treat others with gentle, genuine care today. Many people are easily bruised now, emotionally. You might push their buttons without realizing what you're doing. If you learn that you've hurt someone's feelings, be kind. Offer an apology, even if you think they've overreacted! Blowing off their concerns will only make them feel worse. But validating their feelings will make them feel heard and cared for.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
