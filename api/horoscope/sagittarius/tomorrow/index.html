Signing written contracts can also be dicey now, unless you make sure to read everything thoroughly. If something isn't clear, ask a friend or a professional for clarification. And if a task seems too complex to tackle alone, there's no shame in asking for assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
