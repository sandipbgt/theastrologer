    "horoscope": "You're playing mind games, and it's exhilarating to feel a step ahead of everyone else. But being clever isn't the most important thing now. You need to rise above your mental games today, and connect with people on a genuine level. Real sincerity comes from the heart. So you're going to have to become a team player, which means abandoning this dream of taking over the world with your brilliant mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
