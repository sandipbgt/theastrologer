    "horoscope": "Your mind is abuzz today with interesting facts, figures and theories. You might get so caught up in chasing them down that you lose all track of time. Isn't it wonderful to get so absorbed in intellectual work? You're stimulating your brain and challenging yourself to think outside the box. You may end up discovering a brand-new interest, or something unexpected about a subject you thought you knew well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
