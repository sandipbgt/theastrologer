    "horoscope": "Your sentimental heart and fiery temper are all stirred up today over something that seems like a matter of life and death, or at least happiness and despair. Still, try your best to calm down and compromise. You owe it to yourself and everyone else involved, and if you make the effort, you'll see that things aren't quite as bad as you originally thought. Remember to talk things out instead of acting on pure emotion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
