    "horoscope": "You're an idealist and a visionary. Today's cosmic energy is perfect for taking those ideals and visions and turning them into something concrete. It's a great day to launch a project, preferably with the help of a group of friends or coworkers. With the support of other people, you can brainstorm ways to make your work even more creative and unique. Then put your ideas into practice, and see if they fly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
