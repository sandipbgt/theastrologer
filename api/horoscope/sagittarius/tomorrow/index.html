    "horoscope": "Existing outside your comfort zone is really okay with you. It's even fun. You don't mind feeling confused or searching for answers, because it increases your general sense of wonderment. Still, be generous with yourself today. Take your time as you move artfully through the world, exploring ideas and getting tripped out on all the incredible possibilities life has to offer. Don't worry about finding your comfort zone. It will happen. Your explorations during this brief period will surely lead to peace of mind, as long as you follow your heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
