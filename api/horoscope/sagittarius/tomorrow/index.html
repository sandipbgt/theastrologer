You're just expressing yourself off the top of your head, but others are finding your insights extremely profound, and your fan base is growing. Use this to your advantage. Find some outside support, or look for someone special among the group of your admirers whom you'd like to know a little better. Go for it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
