    "horoscope": "Today is about compromise, which will be difficult for you, to say the least. Ordinarily, you're all about going with the flow. But right now, you're feeling a bit needier and more insecure than usual, so you're more apt to insist on having things your way. But your coworkers and friends will appreciate it if you steer clear of pressure. Play nice,. You'll get a lot further that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
