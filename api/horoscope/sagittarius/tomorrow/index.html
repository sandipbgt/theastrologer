    "horoscope": "If you feel an infusion of energy today, you aren't imagining things. An expansive vibe is making the world more vibrant, and you get into the grove almost effortlessly. This is your nature at work -- your inner energy, outwardly expressed. Explore the boundaries of your world now, past where you've gone before. The best thing you can do today is to learn something new, even as you teach and inspire others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
