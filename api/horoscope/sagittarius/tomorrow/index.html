It's a good thing you have such a well-developed sense of humor, because this is one of those 'human comedy' days, when the struggles and jealousies of your personal relationships flare up to a grand scale. It's good to be able to laugh at yourself, and to forgive someone else's dramatic behavior. They're only human, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
