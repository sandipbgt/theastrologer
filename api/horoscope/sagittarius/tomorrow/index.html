At this rate, you're only a day or so away from going over the edge. Think less about your appetites and more about your health. And stop worrying about what others think. If they're making this many demands on you, they obviously don't care that much about you as a person. Show yourself more love, and settle down with people who'll still respect you when you say no.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
