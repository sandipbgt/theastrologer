You have the experience of someone who's been around the block, and the gusto of someone who lives from one sensory delight to the next. Use all of these qualities today. People need to learn the lessons you can teach them, and they need that information fast. If you're lucky, they're not stuck in the middle of some emergency. Maybe you just don't want them to miss any of what you're experiencing. That's kind of you to bring them along for the ride. You're a good friend.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
