You'll find it exceedingly difficult to sit still for very long, which could be an issue if you're stuck at the office or behind your desk in school. You're much better off if you can be out and about, walking or driving around, visiting people and talking with them. Your head is filled with creative ideas, and you definitely need to talk them out with like-minded people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
