    "horoscope": "Passivity could become an issue today. You don't usually mind making waves, even though you're pretty easygoing. But now, you're unwilling to take a stand, even on important issues. You just want everyone to get along, so you're willing to step back and let someone else have their way if they're more assertive than you are. That's fine, as long as you aren't giving up something truly important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
