    "horoscope": "Where's your sense of humor today? Maybe it's buried under a landslide of troublesome worry and emotion. If you're feeling a bit insecure or blue, don't be too concerned. Other people are dealing with their own emotional dramas now, too, so don't take their words or tones of voice personally. On days like this, it's important to cut people plenty of slack, including yourself. Be gentle, on purpose.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
