    "horoscope": "You're an idealistic person by nature, and today those ideals are at the forefront of your awareness. It's wonderful to meditate on these hopes and convictions: That's how you create the life you've imagined. But don't become discouraged if your pretty visions evaporate under the harsh light of reality. When that happens, it simply means their foundations weren't solid or realistic enough. Go back to the drawing board and refine them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
