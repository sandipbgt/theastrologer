    "horoscope": "You've always been principled, but now you're especially driven by doing the right thing. Whatever situations or issues present themselves today, be upfront about both your intentions and your inhibitions. It may not be easy to talk about things like this -- especially if you have to say 'no' -- but sometimes it's necessary. And it builds your inner strength not to mention your integrity. Plus, now you know your own limits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
