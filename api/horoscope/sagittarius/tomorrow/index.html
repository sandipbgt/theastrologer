    "horoscope": "You seem careless and quirky, fashionably sloppy yet daring to be different. It's all an act, obviously a very good one, but an act just the same. Deep down, you're seething with conventional anxieties. Welcome to the human race. Of course, you don't have to dwell on this stuff all the time. Just be yourself today as kind of a check-in. Let real friends offer real help. They actually like you even if you're all living with one foot in the land of illusion. And that's one less reason to complain.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
