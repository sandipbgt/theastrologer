In a room where everyone's shouting and no one's listening, how much really gets done?, instead of working at cross purposes, listen to the ideas of others and try to find common ground. That way, you won't strain your voice, your health, or your bank account, and you can actually accomplish something.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
