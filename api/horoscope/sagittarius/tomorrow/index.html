And if you can channel some of your curiosity and optimism, you can map out the next month of your life. Consider what's most interesting to you, and how it meshes with your personal values or principles. That's a good starting point for making plans that span the next several weeks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
