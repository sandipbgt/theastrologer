    "horoscope": "You're a wanderer at heart, but today is a good day to take off your wandering shoes and spend some time at home. In fact, you could use the company of familiar, beloved folks. These are the people who make you feel at home, no matter where in the world you are. These are the people you know you can trust, no matter what. Connecting with them today soothes your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
