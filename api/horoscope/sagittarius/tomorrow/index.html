This is a great chance to get a little romance cooking, if you're in the market, because you're extra attractive now. Plus, you possess the courage to approach someone cute and interesting. Any type of social or business engagement will be a success today. Accept any and all invitations, too, because you're a peppy ingredient to any mix. Hmm...does that make you the spice of life?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
