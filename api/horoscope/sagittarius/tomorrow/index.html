    "horoscope": "Let's make something clear today: Your odd points aren't going anywhere, nor should they. If people are wondering what's gotten into you, let them wonder. You are who you are, and that's never going to change. Right now, your focus should be on learning to love yourself, including your flaws, shortcomings and any momentary setbacks along your life path. Know your direction. Trust that your heart won't steer you wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
