Those limits are in place now, and you could do some good by sharing your knowledge with other idealists who happen to be less experienced than you. For your own part, stay close to home today. As you are aware, there are plenty of things to take care of. Your family may need you, or maybe a project at the office isn't complete. Whatever you do, don't ignore your responsibilities now; face them and live up to them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
