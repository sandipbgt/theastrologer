    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic influence is perfect for sharing good times with your favorite people. You're in a playful mood, and you'll keep the crowd laughing with your natural comedic timing. It's a great day for a romantic date or an outing with children. Either one will heighten your youthful exuberance. Heading out with a group of friends is just as nice, since everyone's in the mood to talk, laugh and one-up each other.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
