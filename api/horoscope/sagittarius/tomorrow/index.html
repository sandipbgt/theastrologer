    "horoscope": "Self-awareness is highlighted today. How you conduct your journey within is up to you. You could talk to a friend about your feelings or memories, or to a professional counselor. You could write about them in a journal, or simply record your dreams, since they're sure to be complex and illuminating. However you choose to undergo this process, embark upon it in the spirit of curiosity and discovery.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
