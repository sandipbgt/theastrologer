Life and the universe may seem to conspire to push you into dealing with minor details that you'd rather ignore. If this happens, try not to let it get under your skin! Just do your best to get the particulars in order. Stay as organized as possible, and keep an eye out for any opportunity to fix or improve things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
