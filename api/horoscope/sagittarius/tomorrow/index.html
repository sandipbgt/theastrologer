Once you have everyone's attention, it's up to you how you use it. Personal pursuits will go swimmingly, but don't limit yourself. Find ways to let the universe know how grateful you are for your blessings.  Today, you can really make yourself useful if you try.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
