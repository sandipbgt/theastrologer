    "horoscope": "You'll talk so much today, your voice could be hoarse by evening -- or your fingers might be sore from typing so many emails! Make sure you aren't just talking to hear your own voice. You have a prime opportunity now to learn something important about a project you're working on or a friend you're getting to know better. Networking opens doors for you, so be chatty and witty, but with a purpose.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
