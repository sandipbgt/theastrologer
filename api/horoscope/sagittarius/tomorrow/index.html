    "horoscope": "It's a good day to buckle down and get something important accomplished. You aren't always much for follow-through, but today's cosmic energy gives you an extra boost of focus and determination. Plus, you're a visionary. Take that lofty aspiration you have in your mind and turn it into a reality. Use your creativity, but be sure to be practical, too. That cuts down on false steps and outright blunders.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
