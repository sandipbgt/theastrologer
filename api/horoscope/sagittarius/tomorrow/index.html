    "horoscope": "Pure happiness shifts into utter joy. The world seems like exactly the right place to be, and you're at the center of it, dancing to your very own melody and simply enjoying life. Today you're a superior being -- not in the sense that you're above other people, but that you're tuned in to your own inner light. You're at your best and brightest now, and you can illuminate the world around you. You may even find you have followers -- people who admire your enlightened movements and want to follow your lead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
