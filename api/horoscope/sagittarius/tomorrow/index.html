    "horoscope": "It's time to turn your big ideas into something real-world, practical and tangible. Start thinking today about how to manifest all that imagination in reality. This may be as simple as gathering materials and starting to create what you envisioned. Just make sure you're practical about your resources and your capabilities. Don't take on more than you can handle. If you're restrained and reasonable from the start, you'll reach your goal faster.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
