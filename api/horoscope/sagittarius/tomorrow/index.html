Of course, a penny may be all they're worth. Don't cling too tightly to any particular plan or theory that occurs to you today. For now, it's fair game for all of them. Keep tossing them around with other people. Soon, the best ones will emerge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
