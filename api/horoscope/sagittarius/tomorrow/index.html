    "horoscope": "Today should be about reaffirming your personal and professional connections. Maybe you've been flying solo for a while; maybe you're under the impression that if you want a job done right, you have to do it yourself. But that's a mistaken impression. You need other people's company, help and input. Reach out to your friends and partners now; they need to know they're still important to you. As a matter of fact, you could use the reminder, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
