This makes it difficult to choose a side or a path, so put off decision-making until you feel more certain. In the meantime, learn as much as you can about the subject. Don't try to organize the information if it seems too overwhelming. There will be time for that later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
