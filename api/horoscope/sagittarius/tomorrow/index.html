You're feeling creative, so don't be shy about riffing on a new theory or putting paintbrush to canvas. Bring something into being that wasn't here yesterday, whether it's tangible or intangible. Do something that will make other people think.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
