    "horoscope": "Your energy returns today and you're in a very optimistic frame of mind. The future looks bright, and you're full of big, shiny ideas. Still, some planning wouldn't hurt. You know you have a tendency to jump into things without much forethought,. Sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't. If you're planning something meaningful, do some research and formulate a solid map of your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
