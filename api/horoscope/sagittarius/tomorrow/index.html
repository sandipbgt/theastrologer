Don't make set plans, and try not to develop any firm expectations of the way your day should unfold. Instead, follow your instincts from one experience to another. If life turns out to be a little out of the ordinary, so much the better! You'll have interesting memories to look back on later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
