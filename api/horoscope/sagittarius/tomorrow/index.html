You've got many options, and the only trouble here might be choosing among them. When in doubt, go with the choice that involves close friends and a team effort. The current energy is best used by working with other people toward a common goal that means a lot to you. (c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
