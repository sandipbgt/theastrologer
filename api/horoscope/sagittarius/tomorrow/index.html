Your thoughts are zinging around like lightning bolts, and you're making connections that wouldn't have occurred to you just a day or two ago. But don't be haphazard in your thinking.

If you work through things carefully and rationally, you stand to develop something utterly solid and useable in the real world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
