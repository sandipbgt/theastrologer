Well, get ready for some fun, because now it's time to let the chips fall where they may in a new project or relationship. Odds are good that you'll like where things go from here, because you're balanced and open-minded today, and full of anticipation for the near future. Anything could happen!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
