    "horoscope": "You've never liked limitations. You believe in personal freedom and you do what you can to maintain yours. And today, you won't let yourself be confined by anyone. This isn't just childish rebellion or acting out; this is living life out loud. Enjoy it, because sooner or later, you'll have to return to your regular life -- you know, tending to the day job, returning phone calls and emails, and so on. For now, cut loose.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
