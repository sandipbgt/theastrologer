Use this today to get something substantial accomplished, such as redrawing your budget or tying up loose ends on a project or a work proposal. Make sure you stand by your principles. Don't let anyone push you in a direction that doesn't feel right for you. You may even have some influence over how others handle their own lives. If you can get people to stop and reconsider a hasty action, then good for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
