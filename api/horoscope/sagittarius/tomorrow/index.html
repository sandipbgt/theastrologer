    "horoscope": "You might go head to head with someone today over a certain situation or project. Maybe you want something different than what others want. Differences of opinion are normal, and you're entitled to your own feelings and needs. You should still check in with the others and see if you can find a compromise. You'll feel much better about yourself if you adopt a cooperative attitude instead of pushing your own agenda on everyone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
