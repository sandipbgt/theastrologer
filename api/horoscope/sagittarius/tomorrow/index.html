    "horoscope": "It's important to keep an open mind today. You're always thinking, absorbing and learning, and this is one of your most admirable traits. But today, obstinacy could set in, and it would be difficult for anyone to change your mind once you form an opinion. But if you're closed-minded, you aren't learning anything, are you? So relax and consider other viewpoints -- especially those you automatically believe are flawed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
