    "horoscope": "Your natural sense of humor could really come in handy today. Now more than ever, life is like a divine comedy. You may see your friends or coworkers getting all worked up about not much, expressing passion in all its forms. If you're smart, you'll sit back and let everyone welter around you! Of course, you might be sucked into the drama. If so, try not to take it more seriously than it deserves.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
