    "horoscope": "You're feeling grumpy today and acting impetuous, and from the outside, it could look as if you think your own wants and needs are the only ones that matter. But of course, they aren't. You need to tune in to others' feelings, too, and balance them with your own. Everyone deserves to get at least some of what they want. Be courteous to others and they'll return the favor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
