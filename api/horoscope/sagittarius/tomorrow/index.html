    "horoscope": "Be an acrobat and a diplomat. Strange and exciting as this might sound, it's really a natural blend of skills from your familiar bag of tricks. Here's how it works. First you'll stretch to make both sides meet in the middle. You can do this without hurting yourself or anyone else. Once you have them face to face, then you'll get them to talk. It's a vigorous action with a peaceful outcome. Who said you couldn't be all things to all people? Maybe they can't perform the unlikely, but you certainly can. And that's exactly why you should.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
