And if you're the one whose bells and whistles are about to turn into smoke and mirrors, well, why would you want to draw so much attention to what you lack? Stop working at cross-purposes with your best interests. Today should be sane and sober. And if that means living with a lower profile, be ready to sacrifice some of the fame, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
