    "horoscope": "You may find yourself feeling sentimental today. You might get together with friends and talk about the good old days. Or perhaps someone with whom you used to be close will resurface, whether in real life or simply in your dreams. These old feelings may be bittersweet, and ultimately, you don't want to get stuck looking backward. Still, there's nothing wrong with taking a day or two to steep yourself in memory.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
