    "horoscope": "You're an adventurer, and you need a wide-open vista to feel truly free. But right now, you're limiting your own point of view. Being narrow-minded will only impede your navigation. So open up. Otherwise, you'll start feeling the effects on your health and happiness. If you haven't been smiling much lately, or you're feeling tired and lethargic, you'll know it's time to loosen up about some issue in your life. Accept it as it is, not as you want it to be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
