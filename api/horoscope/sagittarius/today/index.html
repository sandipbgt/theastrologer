    "horoscope": "Fresh thinking helps you surge ahead today in your work or some other pursuit. You're one of the natural visionaries of the zodiac, which means you're always thinking ahead of other people. And now, your mind is especially stimulated! It's as if you have a handle on the future before it ever arrives. When you explore new frontiers of the mind, invite other people to join you. A group expedition is especially fun for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
