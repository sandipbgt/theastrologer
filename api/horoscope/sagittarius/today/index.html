    "horoscope": "If you're feeling emotionally vulnerable today, don't be surprised -- lots of people are. The current cosmic influence has a way of probing subtly at our deepest feelings, such as love and longing, worry and regret. Before you know it, you'll realize you're as tender as a bruise, and you may not even know why! It's good to accept your feelings. You can feel them fully without attaching too much importance to them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
