    "horoscope": "You don't want to be tied down today. Mentally and physically, you crave freedom. You're your own person, after all. And under the current energy, you chafe at anything that feels like a limitation. You might want to travel, and it's a good day to take a trip or to plan one. Most of all, you want to explore the world of ideas at your own pace, with only yourself as your guide.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
