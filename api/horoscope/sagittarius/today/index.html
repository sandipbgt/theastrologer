    "horoscope": "You're operating off pure emotion now, like a pinball bouncing around inside its machine. Things people say to you today -- even their unconscious facial expressions -- could set you off emotionally. Instead of reacting without thinking, try to focus your self-awareness. Venture deeply into your own suppressed reasoning and desires. This careful introspection might make you nervous, or it might seem like a waste of time. But it will help you create positive change in your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
