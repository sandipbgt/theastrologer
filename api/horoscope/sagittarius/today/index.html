    "horoscope": "Today may present an emotional journey. If so, treat it like a roller coaster ride or a white-rafting trip -- something you're better off embracing than resisting.

Greet them with a generous sense of curiosity to find out why they're so intense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
