    "horoscope": "You're feeling excited and excitable, happy and enthusiastic today. From the moment you wake up, you sense this elevated energy! Adventure doesn't even have a chance to find you, because you're already out looking for it. Exercise at least a minimal level of caution; there's a big difference between restless and reckless. As long as you heed obvious dangers, this should be a wonderfully upbeat day, full of possibility.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
