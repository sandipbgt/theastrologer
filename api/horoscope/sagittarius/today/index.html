    "horoscope": "You're honest to a fault, but now that quality comes in handy. Your integrity will open many doors today. You're demonstrating to people just how sterling your character and principles are, and they're inclined to get behind you in whatever project or venture you're trying start. Pay attention to anything in your life that needs closure, too. Think how nice a cleared-off desk will be. Whatever you do now, give it everything you've got, because this brief period of beginnings could take you far.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
