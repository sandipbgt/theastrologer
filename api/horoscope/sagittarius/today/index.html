    "horoscope": "It's a great day for constructing new knowledge. Your thoughts are zinging around like lightning bolts, and you're making connections that wouldn't have occurred to you just a day or two ago. But don't be haphazard in your thinking. A systematic approach to testing out new theories works best. If you work through things carefully and rationally, you stand to develop something utterly solid and useable in the real world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
