    "horoscope": "When adventure comes knocking today, you'll either accept or decline vehemently. Wait -- you, saying no to adventure? Yes, it could happen. You have a lot to accomplish today, after all, and your energy isn't exactly skyrocketing. But whether you decide to go off gallivanting or stick to your schedule, today will be calmer than you expected. Try not to let that be a disappointment! Sometimes it's nice to have some peace and quiet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
