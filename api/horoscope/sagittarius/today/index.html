Your agenda is an open book, and anyone who cared could connect the dots, if you haven't already spelled it out for them. Share your plans with all interested parties today. Soon enough they'll be as excited as you are. They may even hook you up with the right people if you play your cards right. Mentor those who need to know more, and don't bother those who already know too much. Your job is to spread the right kind of knowledge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
