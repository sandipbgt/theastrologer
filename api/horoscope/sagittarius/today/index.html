Today might be tough for you, because you don't particularly want to look back at your past or your family history. But there's a wealth of knowledge and self-understanding to be found in those old, forgotten memories and emotions. A journey into your past could turn out to be quite revealing. Embrace this emotional adventure!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
