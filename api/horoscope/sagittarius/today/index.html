You might feel as if every little thing has the power to get under your skin. Spending time with trusted loved ones is a good idea now. Do your best to avoid anyone who tends to hurt your feelings or push your buttons! Or, spend some quality time on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
