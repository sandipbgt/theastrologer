    "horoscope": "You may be especially attracted to spiritual pursuits today. Meditation and yoga broaden your mind even as they calm and center your energy. Alternatively, a visit to a place filled with meaning -- a church or temple, a mountaintop, a grove of trees in a quiet forest -- may elevate you to a new level of spiritual awareness. Your mind, heart and soul are open and seeking today. Soak up this energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
