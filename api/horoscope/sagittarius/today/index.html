Grab a close friend or your sweetheart and find a creative project to do together. Or go to an art gallery, museum or park. Revel in the beauty of the world around you. Let all the loveliness translate to a delicious sense of sweetness or romance that brings you closer together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
