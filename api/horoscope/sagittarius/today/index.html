    "horoscope": "Keep one eye on the passing human traffic, because certain fashions just seem to do it for you right now. Maybe it's the colors or the cut, or maybe it's the shapes of the people wearing those outfits. Let these and other pleasing visuals trigger fresh mental energy. Listen to the sound of your world and you'll probably start hearing it as music. One way or another, your only choice will be reacting to your environment today. Whatever you touch will become part of you if you let it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
