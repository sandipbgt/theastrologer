    "horoscope": "Honesty is a virtue, and you've always prided yourself on telling it like it is. But being too forward, too often, starts to seem more critical than helpful. People don't appreciate having their flaws pointed out -- especially not when you're doing it to take the focus off yourself. Mind your own business today and use the time to work on improving your imperfections. Better yet, find ways to increase your stores of tolerance, patience and acceptance, for yourself and others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
