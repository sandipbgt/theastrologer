But don't judge your teammates unfairly, even if you think they're making the wrong decisions. It doesn't really matter if you don't take big strides today. What really matters is communicating. Don't try to even up old scores. Instead, start with a fresh, clean slate and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
