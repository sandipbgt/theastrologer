    "horoscope": "You have a high opinion of your efforts. Nobody's denying you the right to self-esteem, but how does all this interface with your on-the-ground reality? That's the real question. You might be easily annoyed if concept and execution don't quite match up today. Oh, come on. Do you really want to be the person who picks a fight over every little thing? Of course not. Nobody aspires to a reputation like that. Your only way out of this mess will be dealing with what is instead of what you think should be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
