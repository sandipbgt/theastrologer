    "horoscope": "You're not the only name on the marquee. You're not single-handedly running the whole show. You can adapt to other people's strategies if you must. Maybe their ideas are fantastic. Maybe they totally stink. But try to make lemonade from these lemons. Remember how this works? Fall back on old, positive conditioning for today. Bring your team-playing skills back online. Be candid but also tactful. You still know how to make people feel good about honest assessment of their work. And if that's something you never learned how to do, you'll figure it out pretty quick.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
