    "horoscope": "Your wandering urge could evaporate today, replaced by a craving for comfortable, familiar surroundings. Alternatively, you might feel constricted by the needs and expectations of your family or your spouse -- they want you at home, when all you want is to break free. In some way, issues of home and family take center stage under the current influence. You may not need comfort and reassurance, but someone near you might.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
