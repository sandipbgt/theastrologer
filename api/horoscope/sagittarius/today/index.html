    "horoscope": "A melancholy mood could set in today, but it won't last long. Don't give it any more power than it deserves -- but don't ignore your feelings, either. If there's something you're sad or worried about, let the emotion sink in. It won't overwhelm you. In fact, the sooner you feel it fully, the sooner it will evaporate. Then you'll be back in fighting form, and you can go tackle the world once again!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
