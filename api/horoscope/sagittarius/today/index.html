    "horoscope": "You're a little too eager today, making offers and promises that you probably can't keep. Are you trying to make up for the shortcomings you perceive in yourself? Don't strain everyone's patience with your repeated offers. Let other people do their own thing, and you do yours. Maybe focusing on a solo project will help you calm your worries and start feeling centered once again. Pull your energy in and make something of it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
