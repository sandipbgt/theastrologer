    "horoscope": "Your devil-may-care attitude is charming without seeming fluffy or insincere. You're totally honest about how willing you are to take it as it comes. But don't let being laid back hold you back. Don't stand aside holding the door for others when you should be the first one through. You wouldn't be giving yourself a fair shake. Find your forward-thinking energy and ride it today. Work casual miracles with whatever falls into your hands. If you can do so much with so little, imagine where a real opportunity could take you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
