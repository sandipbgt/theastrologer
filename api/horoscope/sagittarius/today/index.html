The job may be tedious, and it probably won't be much fun. But apply yourself to it wholeheartedly, with great focus and concentration. That's the best way to get through it. And people will notice how conscientious you were, and remember it later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
