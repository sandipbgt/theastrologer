    "horoscope": "It's hard not to flirt today. You want to be part of everything, whether it's to satisfy some driving passion or just have a little taste. If you're the life of the party, it's because you're wise and introspective, not because you look like an-head. Well, there is a lively part of you. But whatever social skills you deploy, whatever your angle of approach, it will be up to others how involved they'll let you be. Don't take rejection personally. There has to be someone else just as wise who still wants you around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
