You should be eager to make this world a part of you. There's a lot to learn. Expand your sphere today. Let your inner and outer lives merge. It's all for the best. You have to believe this, because believing is what makes everything come true. What, you thought that only happened in fairy tales? Real life is like that, too, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
