    "horoscope": "It's a good idea to take a midday nap today, or go to bed early. You don't have as much physical energy as usual, plus, closing your eyes allows you to dream, whether you're awake or asleep. You'll find that you're vividly imaginative under the current influence. Your dreams may be incredibly strange and interesting. If you're a writer, a musician or an artist of any kind, you'll benefit from tapping into this creativity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
