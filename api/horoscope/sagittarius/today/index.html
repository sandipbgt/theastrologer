    "horoscope": "Today, you're looking for the big picture, but details could overwhelm you, obscuring the truth. It's that old saying -- 'You can't see the forest for the trees.' That could define your day. If so, just stay as focused as possible on your goal. And cut out any distractions that you can control. Ignore emails and the ringing phone for a while, so you can get something done!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
