    "horoscope": "You're feeling so healthy and centered that you're able to help everyone else. You'd make a good philanthropist, you know. You have that rare, uncanny ability to find a need and fill it, and everyone around you appreciates your input. So make yourself useful today. Lend a hand, or an idea, wherever you believe it's needed. You aren't doing it for the credit, but others will appreciate it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
