    "horoscope": "Whoever said harmony equals oblivion didn't have their facts straight. After all, you're highly observant, and you still get along with difficult people. Currently, you're a master at keeping your connections smooth. Everyone around you is uplifted by your easygoing energy. You're setting a good example now; maybe you'll even teach someone how to be more tolerant. But teaching is not your main concern at the moment. You're just here to enjoy yourself today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
