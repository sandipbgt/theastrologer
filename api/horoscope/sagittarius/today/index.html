    "horoscope": "Take a journey of the heart today. Connect with someone you care about, and share a tender moment. Now is also a good time to check in with your own inner self. Spend some time writing in your journal, daydreaming, or reading a book that brings poetic images to mind. This kind of activity inspires your imagination, which helps dissolve the veil between concrete reality and something much more fanciful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
