    "horoscope": "You're in charge today. Why? Because everyone's responding to your high spirits and broad-minded outlook. They all want a piece of what you seem to represent, and boy, do you make it look attractive. Watch, though, that no one takes you for granted. If someone tries to take advantage of the fact that you're so ready for anything, simply take a moment to redraw your boundaries. You have a knack for it today,, and you can do it in a lighthearted way that offends no one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
