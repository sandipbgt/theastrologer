    "horoscope": "Get a big-picture view of your life today. Consider your long-range goals and plans. Have you been working toward them, step by step? If you've strayed from the path you set for yourself, this is a good time to get back on track. Or, you could spend today thinking about the new trail you're blazing. There's no reason not to change your plans, if a new course appeals to you more than old.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
