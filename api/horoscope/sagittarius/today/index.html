    "horoscope": "Today's emphasis on patterns and rules could feel a little restrictive. No one likes being told what to do -- least of all you! But maybe you can view this a little differently. Instead of seeing it as submitting to unreasonable expectations, think of it as doing what you know is right in any situation. Your inner editor will help you determine the most logical or polite action, so you can follow your own direction.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
