    "horoscope": "Your ambitious streak is stirred up today. Normally you don't care that much about what other people think of you, simply because you're not aware of anyone's judgment. But today you have a goal in mind, and you know that reaching it depends in part on impressing someone. Good thing your natural charm is flowing! You can draw in just about anyone, simply by being your honest, optimistic self.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
