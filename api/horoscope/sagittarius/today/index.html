    "horoscope": "Yes, you're a little peculiar, but right now that translates into charming. People can't help noticing you, whether they're choosing up sides for a team or working the room in search of a date. You can turn simple transactions into deep conversations if you want to. But whatever you do with this special status, milk it for all its worth today. You deserve as many friends and allies as you can get. You'll actually need all that help if you want a fast-forward boost toward some distant goal. Why not get yourself a little closer?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
