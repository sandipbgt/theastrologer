But you're in a fine mood, and it's easy for you to give ground, because you aren't worried about losing anything. You genuinely want everyone in your life to get along, and you hold that goal as a high priority. You don't worry about conceding on smaller issues. This is exactly what good friends do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
