Get some physical exercise, because you're going to need to work off some of your copious energy! If you can combine burning calories with working on a project, that's even better. It's a great day for physical endeavors like distributing information door-to-door or helping a friend build a garden.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
