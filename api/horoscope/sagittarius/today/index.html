Maybe it's because your desk is piled high with work, or your agenda is full of meetings and other responsibilities that aren't negotiable. Whatever you have on your list, don't let it overwhelm you. Focus on the goal of working through things one step at a time. Then, tonight, you'll know you did your best when it's time to hit the hay.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
