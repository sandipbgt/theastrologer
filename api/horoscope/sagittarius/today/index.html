    "horoscope": "You get a big boost today from looking at the big picture. Of course, taking the broad view is always your way, but today you inspire the people around you to think big and aim high, too. This gives you a lot of personal satisfaction. But don't stop there. What can you do with this momentum of good feeling and optimism? That's what you should consider today, and begin making plans.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
