    "horoscope": "You've never been overly cautious with your money. You have an easy-come, easy-go attitude toward your finances, and generally, this works out well for you. Just watch out today for the urge to splurge. You've been on a buying binge lately, and you're probably still working to catch up after shelling out for gifts and going out to dinner with friends. Try to be practical today when something catches your eye.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
