    "horoscope": "Get out of the house today. Visit friends or a museum, or hit the road for a short trip. The point today is to stimulate all your senses. Call a long-distance friend, or chat up a stranger. If issues crop up along the way, use your natural flexibility and creativity to find a unique way around the problem. Detours make the road of life more interesting. No one knows that better than you,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
