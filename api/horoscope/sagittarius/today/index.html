Any move toward greater openness is a good thing, even if the process of change is a tough one. After all, most people wouldn't choose their growth experiences, but they're almost always grateful for them later, once the growth has been completed. That's when a new plane of consciousness becomes possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
