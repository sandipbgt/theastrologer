It's because you know that sometimes, informal settings can lead to the freshest ideas. So if you have an appointment today, make it an outdoor lunch date, or ask your associate to walk outside with you while you toss around ideas. Or, just rely on your  ability to put people at ease, regardless of setting or location. Personal research and development should go well now, too.
