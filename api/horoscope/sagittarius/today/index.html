    "horoscope": "Normally, you pay more attention to big concepts like truth, justice, love and freedom than you pay to minor concerns. You think on a broad scale, and that's part of your charm. But today's grounded energy demands that you bring your focus down to a physical, material level. Perhaps you need to get more serious about your career, or set a budget. Do this work now, so you can get back to dreaming.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
