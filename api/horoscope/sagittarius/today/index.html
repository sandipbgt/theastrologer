    "horoscope": "The mission is the message. Anyone who's not on the bus should get the heck out of the way. Zealots need easy answers and severe conditions. If that's you, you'll work best in a binary world where everything is yes or no, black or white, right or wrong. Real life isn't like that, as you know. Modify your program. Break those big ambitions down into a few smaller milestones. It won't tarnish your ideals, but it will give you reasons to feel good about yourself that won't scare the people who disagree with you. It helps to be loved.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
