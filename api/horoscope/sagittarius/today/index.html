    "horoscope": "The lure of excitement sucks you in. Instant gratification will keep you there. With no limits on your space and no unwelcome demands on your time, you could be wickedly inventive today. Of course, that would be wicked in the kindest, most constructive ways possible. Maybe you'll mess with people's minds, and bend their thoughts into shapes that will help them. Maybe you'll tickle loved ones until they finally relax and laugh along with you. The more everyone gets out of this, the more fun it will be for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
