Today, be straightforward about taking the credit -- or the blame -- for where those ideas have led. If you got a little too carried away on a project at the office, own up to it and start brainstorming ways to fix things. In fact, this sort of thing may happen a lot today, so be ready for it. Your best approach is honesty, which shouldn't be difficult -- that's always been one of your most admirable qualities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
