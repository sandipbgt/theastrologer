    "horoscope": "Get out into the world today and talk to people. Laugh, gossip, trade stories, but most of all, brainstorm, because your creativity is running high, and so is everyone else's. Conversations are an adventure now, since you never know where they might lead or what strokes of genius they might inspire. So keep your eyes and ears open, whether you're talking to an old friend or a perfect stranger.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
