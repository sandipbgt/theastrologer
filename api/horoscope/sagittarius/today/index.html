    "horoscope": "You're an artist and a wanderer at heart, but sometimes it's smart to color within the lines. Today, self-discipline counts for a lot. If your attention begins to stray from the task at hand, treat it like an unruly child: Lead it back again. Repeat as needed. It might feel tedious in the moment, but later you'll be glad you applied yourself so diligently.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
