You may have to live up to the high standards of your employer, or stick to a certain routine when you'd much rather do your own thing. But you'll find that following the rules actually saves you time and effort. And don't worry -- life should loosen up again in just a day or two.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
