Sure, you won't always be this optimistic and energetic. But you can retain a sense of what it feels like to be so tuned in, interested, and appreciated. The next time you feel listless or bored, just remember today, and you'll feel rejuvenated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
