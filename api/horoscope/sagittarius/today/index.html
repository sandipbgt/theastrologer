But it may not be the best day for making an important life change or major decision. There's a lot to be said for being spontaneous, but sometimes impulsive decisions don't work out. Make sure that if you venture into the realm of something big and new today, you think it through before committing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
