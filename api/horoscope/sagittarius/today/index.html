    "horoscope": "You're in a relaxed, easygoing mood today, even more than usual. Being with friends feels wonderful. Even your coworkers are full of fun and laughter. Everyone around you is in the mood to get along. That makes this a great day to form a professional alliance or any kind of team. You can also use this influence to rebuild a connection with someone that has recently been strained.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
