    "horoscope": "Your creativity is enhanced today. So is your urge to be social. Why not put the two together? Organize an impromptu art project with a group of children or good friends. Or help your coworkers brainstorm ideas for a new endeavor or project at work. The sky is the limit now -- and that's only if you allow yourself to be limited by the heavens! Have fun today,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
