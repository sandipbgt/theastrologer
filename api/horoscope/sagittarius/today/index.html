And if you can bring a friend along, so much the better! Today's events are definitely better when shared with like minds. But if you do go solo, you'll have stories to share later on. You can still make people laugh and think, even if they weren't there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
