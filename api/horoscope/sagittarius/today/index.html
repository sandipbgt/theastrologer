    "horoscope": "Sometimes you get stuck in your opinions, don't you? This could be one of those times. A good idea turns into little more than dogma, and next thing you know, you're annoying the very people you're trying to impress. Well, you can't help it if you're feeling blindly stubborn, can you?

Later, you'll be more open to other views.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
