But the very energy you're putting toward evasion could just as easily be put toward a solution. Why not give it a try? Instead of attempting to laugh things off, get down to the root of the matter: Have your feelings been hurt? Have you hurt someone else's? If you can make the leap from avoidance to honesty, you'll sort everything out very soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
