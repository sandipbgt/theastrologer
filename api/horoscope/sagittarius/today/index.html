Your style is straightforward and easy to understand because it usually saves time. It's as if you can do no wrong today. Well, you could still make a mistake, but you may be the only one who'll notice if it happens. And remember, personal gain is OK, too. Don't ignore your needs just because you're being ethical. Everyone needs to eat, drink, love and have a good life, and you're no exception.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
