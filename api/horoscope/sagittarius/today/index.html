Trading stories and ideas with other people leads to new understanding of old questions. Maybe you'll even come up with an innovative approach to a problem or project you've been working on. Just keep the ideas flowing. That's the main thing -- that, and getting out into the world and mingling with other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
