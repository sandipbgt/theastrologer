    "horoscope": "All your relationships, major and minor, are worth something in the here and now, and you're aware of that fact. Gender and background don't matter today. With a little focused effort, you can move past what you expect of people based on their appearances, and get to know the person inside. This is your chance to see through their cleverly constructed masks as well as your own notions of others' needs and feelings. Truth is waiting for you to discover it, as soon as you open your heart and your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
