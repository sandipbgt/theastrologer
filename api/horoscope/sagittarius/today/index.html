And you're certainly creative enough to make your own excitement, if there isn't any on your agenda. You can spice up even the most dull errand or meeting. Just be careful how you say things in polite company. The current influence might impel you to speak without thinking.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
