    "horoscope": "High energy may have you feeling excitable, restless and a little overwhelmed. You're in a great mood, but sometimes, 'too much of a good thing' really does exist -- even for you. Meet your physical needs ASAP. That means hit the gym or the trail, and work off some of that excess steam. Then, go home, or wherever you're happiest, and make yourself comfortable. Other people are depending on your clear head today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
