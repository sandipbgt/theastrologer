Instead of taking this personally, try to look at it as a learning experience. Maybe it's not that your needs aren't valid or your ideas are wrong -- maybe it's your delivery. Could you try a softer, more inclusive approach? If you open your heart to the lessons of this situation, you're sure to learn something good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
