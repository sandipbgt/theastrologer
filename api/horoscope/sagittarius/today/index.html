    "horoscope": "Stop dreaming and start scheming. Wake up and smell the opportunity. Yes, you probably ought to do something about that, because you won't get back to sleep now. Start by bringing your hopes and goals back online. They should still make perfect sense even if conditions have changed since the last time you tried this. Today you'll be a magnet for all that you need. Hold out your hand and see what falls into it. Spontaneity can lead to success if you keep connecting the dots until they make a good, sturdy bridge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
