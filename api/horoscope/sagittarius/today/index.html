    "horoscope": "Get together with other people today, whether for fun or for something more focused. Group efforts are highlighted, and you're a great member of any team. You may not want to take charge of things -- too much responsibility! But your natural optimism motivates people to stay positive-minded. Your high spirits inspire them to function as a real crew. You can accomplish so much when you work with like-minded people!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
