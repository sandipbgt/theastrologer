    "horoscope": "You may feel extra restless today, especially if you're stuck at work or home. Distracting yourself with puzzles, conversations and new ideas helps, but only for so long. Soon, your fingers start tapping again, and your eyes start darting toward the clock or the door. Find an escape if you can. If you can't, it's a great time to plan one for the near future, since you're more attuned to details than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
