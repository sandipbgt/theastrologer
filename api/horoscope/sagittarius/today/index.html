Anything bold and innovative captures your imagination, especially if it appeals to your principled side -- the part of you that places great meaning in your life philosophies. These conversations may or may not lead anywhere specific, but they'll certainly hold your interest, and they could become fodder for future projects.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
