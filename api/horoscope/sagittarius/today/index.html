You'd prefer to surge ahead, and make this thing you've dreamed up a sudden and spectacular reality -- but that's not how life works. Not when it comes to important projects and labors of love. So try not to let all this organizing and planning get to you. It's an important step in realizing this dream of yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
