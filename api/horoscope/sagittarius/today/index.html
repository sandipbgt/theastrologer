    "horoscope": "This pinnacle of triumph feels like the perfect opportunity to transcend whatever prize you're about to win. Is that noble or what? The world is yours, yet you'd sacrifice it all in one elated moment. Hey, it's good that you're feeling so generous, but this kind of sacrifice won't be necessary today. Everyone here is working together, giving and getting. You're all rich, beautiful and lucky. Maybe there really is such a thing as justice in life. And maybe the story isn't over, but you'll gladly savor this happy ending while it's here.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
