    "horoscope": "Often, you take life as it comes, but today, a rare ambitious urge flares to life within you. You have a big idea in mind, and you want everyone to know it's yours. Talk to people about your ideas. Get creative and let your mind roam as you form your plans. People want to support you. You'll have to decide if you want allies or if you'll do this thing alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
