You generally have an easy-come, easy-go relationship with money, but today you may be more attuned than usual to your bank balance. Do what you can to increase or stabilize your income. No, money doesn't buy happiness. But it certainly makes life a lot easier!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
