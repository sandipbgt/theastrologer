    "horoscope": "Today, make a special effort to pay attention to detail. If you don't, you may end up having to redo something you thought you'd already completed. Signing written contracts can also be dicey now, unless you make sure to read everything thoroughly. If something isn't clear, ask a friend or a professional for clarification. And if a task seems too complex to tackle alone, there's no shame in asking for assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
