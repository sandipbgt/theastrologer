    "horoscope": "You have a playful personality, but that doesn't mean you can't get down to business when you need to. Today is for getting serious and buckling down.

And if you're organized in your efforts, you might be able to finish work early, so you can play!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
