You're so busy chatting with people, returning phone calls and answering emails, you don't have time to hit the road and head out for parts unknown! This might feel frustratingly limited, but it's a great chance to gain new perspective. Other people might bring up subjects you've never considered before.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
