    "horoscope": "Your idealistic nature is up and you see the world for its possibilities, not its limitations. Maybe you're a bit impractical; but right now, who cares?

Launch something wonderful now. This could be the start of a really great time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
