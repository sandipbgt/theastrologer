    "horoscope": "When things get too dull for your active imagination, you have the creativity needed to improve upon boring old reality. That's a real talent, and anything is better than the day-to-day grind -- but can you truly fulfill your dreams? Today is more about desiring than doing, and that's okay for now. Start a savings plan for some special activity. Before you know it, your dream will come true.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
