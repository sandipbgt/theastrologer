    "horoscope": "Caution isn't a word or a concept that you employ often. But today, it comes in handy. Instead of taking rash risks, plan out your moves. This is especially important if you're thinking of investing some money, or if you've come to a turning point in your career. The more you use care and prudence in planning things out, the more likely you are to create just the future you've envisioned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
