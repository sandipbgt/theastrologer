    "horoscope": "If you're in the mood to go out on the town today, don't expect your friends to feel the same way. Everyone around you seems moody, and no one wants to experience anything new. In fact, you might be feeling the same way. Your usual taste for exotic food and adventurous experiences is reduced. Maybe it's a good day to stay home with family or close friends, and revel in the comfort of familiarity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
