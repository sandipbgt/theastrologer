    "horoscope": "Following the rules may not be your thing, but try to do it today anyway. That includes fulfilling your duties and promises to other people. Being the kind of person who follows through on their word takes on extra importance now. Honor counts for a lot under the current cosmic influence. No matter how much you might wish you could blow off your responsibilities, hang in there and get it done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
