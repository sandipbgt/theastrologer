You know learning can be beneficial; it's one of your favorite activities. But sometimes not knowing is good, too. That's your mindset today. You'll have fun just exploring the questions that pop into your mind. You'll feel inspired by everything you're dreaming about and considering. Perhaps you'll hatch up a grand scheme, something to launch when the energy shifts from thought to action.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
