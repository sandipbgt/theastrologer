    "horoscope": "You might feel bursting with crystal-clear insight, but you're coming across as a little cocky and brash. Plus, your choice of subjects is more than a little bit tedious for everyone else. No wonder they're all fleeing for the exits as soon as you open your mouth! If this happens, don't raise your voice -- just take the hint, and stop talking. It's a good idea to change course and lighten up. Plus, listening to other people will make them more likely to listen to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
