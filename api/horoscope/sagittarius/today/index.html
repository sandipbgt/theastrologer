It's all so humdrum and mundane, and you're so much more fascinating, aren't you? Well, that may be true, but it doesn't give you license to patronize other people. You're human, too, after all. Besides, who you used to be doesn't have a whole lot to do with the person you are now. Check in with who you've become today. This could be an effective, humbling exercise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
