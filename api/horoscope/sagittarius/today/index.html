    "horoscope": "It's important to be dependable today. Perhaps your reputation is riding on it. Or maybe this will simply come down to living up to the expectations of someone you love. Either way, place a priority on keeping your promises and your commitments. If you tend to make impulsive moves or decisions, go against nature by thinking things through before you act. Forethought and planning are especially favored now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
