    "horoscope": "Conversations have a way of getting deep and intense quickly today. You might learn something unexpected about a friend or a coworker. Or maybe this is the universe's way of pushing you to inspect your own deeper feelings. Either way, it's important to listen with an open mind and heart. Try not to judge yourself or anyone else. We're all human, after all. And being human can get sticky sometimes!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
