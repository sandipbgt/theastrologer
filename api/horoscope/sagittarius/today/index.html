But don't be surprised if you look back at the end of the day and realize you didn't actually get anything accomplished. If that happens, don't stress out about it. Sometimes, talking is as important as doing, especially if you do a good amount of listening, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
