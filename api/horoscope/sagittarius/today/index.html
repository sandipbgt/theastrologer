    "horoscope": "A pessimistic attitude may get in the way of forward progress today. Don't be stubborn, even if you're know that you're correct. Let other people realize the truth on their own time. It'll happen, you'll see. Things will change for the better, but only if you take a step back and let them. If you try to micromanage everything, on the other hand, things will keep going along as they've been: one step forward, and two steps back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
