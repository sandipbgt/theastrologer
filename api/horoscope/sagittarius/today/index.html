You might think you know your opinion, or the right move to make; but then things won't go as you anticipated. Someone else is envisioning such a different scenario than you are! Maybe you could ask a trusted friend for their input, because you may not be viewing things clearly now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
