    "horoscope": "You tend to be a fun-loving and easygoing person, but today your emotional side may be aroused. It's easy to get upset under the current influence, and overreactions are common. Someone might hurt your feelings without realizing they've said anything to get under your skin. You might also step on someone else's toes without realizing it. To avoid this, be as gentle and tactful with others as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
