    "horoscope": "The current cosmic energy is logical in nature. This influence could make you feel rather inhibited, since creativity, idealism and exploration -- your strengths, your favorite things -- now take a back seat to realism. It's important to stay grounded. Approach your work and other tasks methodically. Set high standards and then focus on attaining them. Most of all, follow through on the goals you set and the promises you make.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
