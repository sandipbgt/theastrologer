    "horoscope": "If you're still feeling a little cranky today, keep on waiting out this mood as gracefully as possible. Get some gentle exercise to help burn off some of the tension. At home, keep your snacking to a minimum, because the tendency runs strong now to solve emotional issues with flavors and textures. Of course, there's nothing wrong with indulging in a scented bubble bath or a luxurious nap. These could help you stay centered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
