    "horoscope": "An encounter or experience could deeply move you today. Even a show you watch on TV could affect you in a big way. You're especially emotional, which could include melancholy. Don't resist the tide of feeling that washes through you. That would be like trying to resist the pull of the ocean itself! An honest acceptance of your true emotions can lead you toward greater self-understanding, and that's a journey you'll surely embrace.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
