The current energy is the kind that pushes you to do the responsible thing, even if you'd rather toss your duties to the wind. Find a reason you can believe in to work hard. Do it for the people you love, or simply to prove to yourself that you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
