    "horoscope": "You're not big on doom and gloom, but today it's easier than ever to stay cheerful. Life is good. Maybe you're in love. Maybe you're in the money. Maybe you're just in a pleasant space right now. But don't go bouncing off the walls just because there's a spring in your step. Whether you're the fearless leader, the resident expert or somehow responsible for setting a good example, others expect you to keep a level head now. Don't go turning an even keel into a slippery slope.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
