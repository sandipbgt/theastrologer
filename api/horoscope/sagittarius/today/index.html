    "horoscope": "High energy is yours today. Of course, you're an energetic type by nature. It's rare that your inner fire dims! But today brings a special gift -- that of initiative. Sometimes you might have a hard time getting things going, but that isn't an issue now. You can launch a project or make an important life change with little trouble. Tap into your resources, including good friends and allies, and make this thing happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
