    "horoscope": "You're in your element today: charming and self-assured, bold and graceful all at once. All eyes are on you, so you're in the perfect position to impress others. This isn't just for the sake of stroking your own ego, either. You can garner support for a project or impress higher-ups at work -- you know, the people who determine raises and promotions. Set a meaningful goal for yourself today. You're likely to reach it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
