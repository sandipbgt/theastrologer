    "horoscope": "Your creative side is prominent today, and problems seem more like interesting puzzles -- ones you know you can solve, given just a little time to consider the variables. If skills like thinking on your feet and talking your way out of corners come in handy in your line of work, you're sure to be a star employee today. Just make sure there's some substance behind your words. It would be a shame to waste all this energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
