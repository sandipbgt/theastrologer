    "horoscope": "Passion is on the rise today. This could be a very positive, affirming experience, but things could get complicated if you give in to the darker potential of the current influence. Your feelings run deep now, and could give rise to possessiveness or jealousy if you don't get the connection you crave. Instead of doing something you'll feel silly about later, just be honest about your feelings and needs, with yourself and others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
