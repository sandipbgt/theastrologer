You're a people-lover by nature, and right now you really want to feel a sense of accord with your group of friends or business associates. But if folks aren't working together as well as you might wish, try not to feel too dismayed. Instead, do what you can to create a positive group dynamic. Your sunny energy can surely inspire everyone to cooperate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
