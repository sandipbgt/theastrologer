The fact that you're a leader is clear to everyone, but your secret weapon is that you're still approachable, making you a great favorite among your peers. You mingle with the crowd like a natural celebrity. Brush up your people skills, because the world is waiting for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
