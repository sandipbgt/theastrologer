    "horoscope": "That's quite an appetite you have there. Where do you put it all? This sounds like a personal question, although it seems fair to ask when you're so willful about your intake yet so guarded in your output. Maybe you don't want to bother people by offering them just anything, or maybe you don't feel like sharing. A tight fist might hold you back, whatever your reason for it. So what would happen if you gave compulsively and kept only a little for yourself? Switch it around today and you just may see some progress.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
