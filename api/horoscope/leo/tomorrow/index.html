    "horoscope": "Aggravation and thwarted effort screw up your day today. Maybe you're suffering from excessive ambition and a closed budget. If so, try scaling back. If you redirect your funds more realistically, you'll greatly lessen your stress, which will make things seem a lot more manageable.
