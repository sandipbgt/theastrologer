    "horoscope": "It's a good day to think critically. Whether you're chatting with a friend or working on a professional project, focus on the details.

But right now, communicating and operating in a more judicious, levelheaded way will help you make the most of your current energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
