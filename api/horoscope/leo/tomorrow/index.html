    "horoscope": "This should be a great day, one full of initiative, friends and laughter. Your best qualities are shining out for all to see. You're charming and friendly, warmhearted and generous.  And who wouldn't be attracted to such ambition and courage? Enjoy yourself in the moment, but put some thought into the next few weeks, too. It's a good time for setting a personal goal and working toward it with optimism and vigor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
