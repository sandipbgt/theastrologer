Exploring unfamiliar locations is one of the best expressions of the current energy. But reading up on an interesting subject works, too. So does trying out a new restaurant or seeing a foreign film. Find some way to broaden your world view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
