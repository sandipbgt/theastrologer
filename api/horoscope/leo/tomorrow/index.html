    "horoscope": "Usually, you're warm and effusive in your expressions of approval. But right now you're stingy with praise and dogmatic in your reasoning. Instead of looking upon the world with a generous, affectionate eye, you're feeling suspicious. This is just a temporary rough patch, however -- and not to minimize your feelings, but it's probably all in your head. Try to stay open to new paths and ideas, even if change seems scary.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
