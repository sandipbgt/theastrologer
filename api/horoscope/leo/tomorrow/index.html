You aren't in the most confident frame of mind now, so it's natural to become more preoccupied with your own issues. Remember when you get all worked up, judging other people's behavior isn't a good idea. Maybe it's you not them who needs an attitude adjustment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
