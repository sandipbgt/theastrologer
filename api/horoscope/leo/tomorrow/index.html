    "horoscope": "You've been pushing through a stagnant period, and now it's high time for a shakeup. You'll run the gamut of emotions and experiences today as you work with and against other people, trying to push your agenda through. The big question is, will you confuse or clarify the issue? Be honest about the role you play. That way you can step back and let someone else have the spotlight. Maybe they can find a positive, proactive solution that works for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
