The good vibes you're sending out are coming back full-force. Find a useful way to channel this positive energy, such as tackling a creative project or connecting with an old friend -- or with someone you've been admiring from afar. Whatever you do, have fun while you get things done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
