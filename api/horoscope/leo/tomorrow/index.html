    "horoscope": "You'll need a physical workout today. Get outside and hit the trail or gym for a vigorous session.

So try not to let any anxiety turn into full-fledged desperation. Head that off with simple measures like a long jog or a few hours of exertion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
