    "horoscope": "You're at your charming best today, so don't spend the day alone if you don't have to. Even a business meeting gives you a chance to shine.

You can also bring folks over to your corner if you need their support for a certain project or other activity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
