You may come into contact with someone who seems very controlling, or who pushes your buttons in some deep way that you may not even fully understand. Your natural reaction might be to snap at them or push back in some way, but it would be better to temper your own actions, even if you believe they're out of line. Self-control is most important now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
