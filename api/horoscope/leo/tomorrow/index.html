People are drawn to you -- it's almost as if you're glowing with good humor! These are perfect conditions for creating any reality you want,. The goodwill you've created for yourself is a fleeting opportunity, so take advantage of it today. Be generous, and your kindness will come back to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
