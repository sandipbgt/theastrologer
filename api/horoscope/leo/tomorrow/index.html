    "horoscope": "You're being too hard on yourself today. Don't let self-criticism get out of hand, because you're taking judgments from all sides now -- at least, it feels that way -- and the last thing you need is to turn against yourself. Treat yourself with gentle care until this mood passes. It may help to repeat mantras to yourself, so you'll remember that you're an intelligent, hardworking person who is admired by many.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
