    "horoscope": "Whatever your issues might be today, don't expect much sympathy from others. They have their own problems to worry about. They might seem unsympathetic to you, but they're really just taking care of their own business. That's exactly what you should do today, too. That uneasy feeling in your gut will vanish as soon as you take an honest look at anything in your life that's on shaky ground, and start to fortify it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
