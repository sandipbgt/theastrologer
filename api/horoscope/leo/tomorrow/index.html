At the end of a long day, you actually have something to show for it, if only a to-do list with lines drawn through most or all of the tasks. Doing your work thoroughly and conscientiously might be a little lonely, but it proves you're reliable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
