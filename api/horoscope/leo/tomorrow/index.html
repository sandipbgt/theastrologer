    "horoscope": "Relationships are in the spotlight today. There's a push-and-pull going on here, and it feels as if someone's got to win. Be strong if you have to, but don't push your agenda too aggressively. In fact, it would be much smarter to forget about winning or losing and seek a compromise instead. Ask the other person what they need to feel comfortable, and listen carefully when they answer. You can probably live with their terms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
