Throw yourself into the middle of their troubles and watch their enemies run off with their tails between their legs. Help your new best friends heat things up, put out fires, or whatever they need from you. Even if nothing dramatic is going on, give them high quality focus today. Your nobility will be rewarded, just in case you wanted a reward. But as long as everyone exits laughing, that will probably be enough, don't you think?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
