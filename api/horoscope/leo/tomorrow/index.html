Ego may present a problem, though, if you also insist that you're the greatest, and all must bow down to you. If your sparkling personality has been carrying you forward lately, today is sure to set you back. Maybe you really want or need something, but there are other ways to get it. Be careful how you force your will today. Avoid all unnecessary damage, because people might start holding you responsible, and that could get expensive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
