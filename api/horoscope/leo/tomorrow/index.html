    "horoscope": "Watch that stubborn streak of yours today. Headstrong behavior doesn't go over well right now. Your emphasis should be on teamwork, not on maintaining your individuality at any cost. So put on a smile, even if you have to fake it till you make it. Sometimes a forcedof cooperation is better than the most honest state of obstinacy. Later, you'll be glad you made the effort to get along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
