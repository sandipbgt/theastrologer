But on days like today, when victory doesn't seem like a sure thing, desire takes on a darker hue. You might even get a little obsessive about what you want. Don't fall into that trap,. Trust in your personal power and charisma. You'll make it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
