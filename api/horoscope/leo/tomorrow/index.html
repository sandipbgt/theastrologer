    "horoscope": "It's a good day to cut back and conserve. Don't spend money unless it's absolutely necessary. Use your time wisely, too, and only on projects that will help you build a better future for yourself and your family. In general, anything excessive or impulsive just isn't favored today. And that's fine with you. Restricting your spending or other resources feels good now, because you know it's the right thing to do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
