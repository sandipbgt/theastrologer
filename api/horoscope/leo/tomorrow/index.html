    "horoscope": "Today you'll be ready for just about anything. You can hang loose while somehow staying perfectly composed. Does that sound impossible? You'll soon find out just how easy it is. Solve complex equations over the course of a friendly conversation. Crack impossible codes with a smile and a casual wave of the hand. There's no trick to any of this. It's just your skill set finally bearing fruit. Share what you have and show how it's done. Even if you give away your secrets, it's not like anyone else could actually compete with you in this area. They're welcome to try, though.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
