Issues seem unclear, and vulnerable feelings may get stirred into the mix, making it even harder to take a determined step forward. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Take things slowly and feel your way along. It's okay to make slow progress for the next day or two.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
