    "horoscope": "You look good and feel great today. Your energy is high, and there's an extra sparkle in your eye and bounce in your step. If you have to do any kind of public presentation, such as speaking at a meeting or giving a musical or dramatic performance, you'll do a wonderful job, simply because you feel so good. Even if you're just working or running errands, you'll shine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
