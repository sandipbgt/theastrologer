Yes, everything that happens to you can be useful, too. Today's optimism will put you on top of the world, or at least so far up the food chain that none of the bottom feeders will stand a chance. Because, life without bottom feeders -- does it get any better? This is the best thing that could happen to you. And it all starts with your attitude. Never forget this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
