    "horoscope": "Your romantic streak is as wide as a river today. If you're coupled up, it's a great time to sleep in with your sweetie or spend quality time together. If you're single, focus on your ideal relationship. Envisioning the kind of connection you hope to have with someone will help you create it in reality. Just make sure your expectations aren't too idealistic! Base them in reality, not pure fantasy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
