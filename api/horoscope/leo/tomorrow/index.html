    "horoscope": "You pride yourself on your strength and courage. But today may not be the best day to exhibit those attributes. Your energy is low-key now. You might feel emotionally vulnerable or expressive. And that's okay. No one can be the center every day -- not even the brave, powerful Lion. So be gentle with yourself, and with others. You aren't the only one who's feeling this way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
