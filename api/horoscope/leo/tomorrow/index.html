You can use this to your benefit, especially if you have to give a presentation at work or get up in front of a group. Your confidence is strong and even if you make a misstep, you can recover quickly. Use humor and enthusiasm to win others to your side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
