    "horoscope": "Your usual high energy is somewhat subdued today. You may not feel like being social, unless it's to spend time with an old, dear friend or current sweetheart. And if you have to work, try to spend time on creative rather than mundane tasks. Be gentle with yourself. Completing even minor tasks is an accomplishment, because most people are feeling a little slow today. Get to bed early, if you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
