    "horoscope": "Today will require a masterful act. Good thing you're a natural at playing a role. The current part you're playing? That of benevolent ruler. Let people know who's boss, but do so gently. They won't respond well to aggressive attempts at controlling their behavior or output. However, they'll rebel if they sense even a shred of weakness on your part. Don't let your uncertainty show. Assume a posture of ease, balance and compassion. That way, you can be their inspiration, and they'll become your support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
