    "horoscope": "It's a great day for a social gathering. You're also feeling especially creative. Why not refresh your living space with a new look? Set out some fresh flowers or a new throw pillow for the couch. Then invite over your favorite people. If a party isn't an option, you can create an enjoyable atmosphere no matter what you're up to. Even gatherings at work or school are fun, as long as everyone's interacting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
