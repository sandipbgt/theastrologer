    "horoscope": "A romantic mood settles in today. Life seems sweeter and more precious, and also, perhaps, more heartbreaking. You might be in the mood to read some poetry, or write your own. You might simply want to stare out the window and let your mind wander. Your thoughts tend to go backward now, into the realm of memory. There's something restorative about sifting through old feelings and recollections, even if they're bittersweet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
