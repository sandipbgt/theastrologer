    "horoscope": "Your creativity is on high today. Your imagination is always vivid, but now it's especially so. Your dreams might be extra intense, and when you're awake, it's easy to imagine just about any event or outcome. This could be challenging, if you're feeling anxious and you let your imagination run away with you. But if you channel this energy into an artistic or creative project, you could create something deeply infused with meaning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
