    "horoscope": "It's your moment to be hot instead of cold. It's your best chance in ages to radiate courage. You're more adept than ever at owning situations that will work for you, and at backing away from disasters that might drag you down. Because, as Shakespeare put it, discretion is the better part of valor. So you don't want to be doing too many stupid things in the name of bravery. And by the way, you'll look good while playing this game. Everyone will notice. Indeed, heroics like these aren't easy to ignore.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
