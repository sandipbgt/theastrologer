    "horoscope": "You're the caretaker today. Friends and family are coming to your door, wanting to be fed or nourished emotionally. You're more than up for it, and very much feeling the devotion. Isn't it nice to help out -- especially when you don't have to do it all the time? Shut the door on an unfeeling world and create a warm, cozy cocoon in your home. You'll be happy floating in this sweet space for a bit -- but then it will be time to rejoin the fray.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
