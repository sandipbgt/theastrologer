    "horoscope": "You're feeling a bit vulnerable, so you could either lash out at people you care about -- who haven't actually done anything to hurt you -- or withdraw into sulky silence. A good way to take your mind off your own issues is to focus on helping someone else. There are a lot of people in need, you know. Offer your services to someone who could use a little warmth and assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
