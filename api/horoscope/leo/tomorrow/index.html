    "horoscope": "Your closest relationships may take the spotlight today. It's a great day to talk out even difficult, sensitive issues, because it's easier than usual to set your ego aside and listen with compassion. You're aware that the other person's side is as valid and real as yours. You're looking for points of connection instead of the differences that divide you. That peacekeeping approach should improve things between you immediately.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
