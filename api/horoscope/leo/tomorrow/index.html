    "horoscope": "You love to shop, but today it's better to conserve your resources. Fortunately, you've got a good grasp on long-term issues like saving money for a rainy day. Sure, you want a closet full of stylish clothes and all your favorite CDs, but on days like this, you're willing to delay personal gratification in favor of working hard for the future. This is one of your best qualities,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
