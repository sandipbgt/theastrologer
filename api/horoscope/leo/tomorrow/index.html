    "horoscope": "You're feeling a bit vulnerable today, but this shouldn't become too intense or overwhelming. Spending time with people you love will help you feel more centered and secure. Remember, there are many people who care about you a lot, and many whom you care about. They want to help you through any rough patches you may experience. Just try not to dramatize your feelings. In a moody moment, repeat this mantra: This, too, shall pass.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
