    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if you feel a little emotionally vulnerable today. Many people are in highly subjective states of mind now, and deep insecurities have a way of coming to the surface of your consciousness. You might have vivid dreams that linger long after you're fully awake. If so, pay attention to them, or even write them down. They probably hold important information about your unconscious needs, anxieties or other emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
