    "horoscope": "Feelings of vulnerability could arise today. You're known as the strong, courageous one among your friends or coworkers. But now, having to be bold or decisive could make you want to hide under the covers! Bolster your courage by reminding yourself that you have a lot of support to draw from. Lots of people adore you, and most are ready with a sympathetic ear if you need to talk out an issue.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
