    "horoscope": "Make plans for the near future today. You're strong, centered and in control of your own destiny. You know you can get whatever you want or need. Sure, it might take some hard work or some inspired thinking. But you're creative by nature, and strong down to your toes. You can do this! So look forward to the next four weeks. Choose a goal and start moving toward it, decisively and courageously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
