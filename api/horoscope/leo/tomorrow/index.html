    "horoscope": "It's a great day to be spontaneous. You have a taste for impromptu activities and whimsical pursuits. What fun, to chase down your impulses as they arise! And freeing yourself in this way is a wonderful use of the current cosmic energy. If you can take a trip someplace new, or plan one for the future, so much better. Even just daydreaming about the places you'd like to go is fun and productive."
