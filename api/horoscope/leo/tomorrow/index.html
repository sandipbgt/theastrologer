    "horoscope": "Can you feel it -- that sense that you're just on the edge of something wonderful? Maybe it's a discovery about yourself, or a realization about a personal relationship. Perhaps it's a breakthrough in your work. Whatever it is, you're tapping into something really special, and it feels good. You're vigorous and inspirational, too, able to bring light and encouragement to others' lives. You're a shining example to everyone in your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
