    "horoscope": "Your inner warmth and passion are vividly on display today. You're at your brightest, boldest best, as long as you're receiving plenty of positive feedback. But you would feel crushed if you went out on a limb to express your inner truth and no one responded as you'd hoped. If that happens, try not to let it affect you so deeply. Your inner power may be the slow-burning kind that takes time to manifest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
