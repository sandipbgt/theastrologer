    "horoscope": "Well, they've evaluated your crowd-pleasing effectiveness, and the results are looking good. You're more than pleased. You're positively jolly. Or if those words sound too civilized for you, just think of yourself as more fun than anyone. Work the room and light up the sky for another day. Behave like the silly animal that you are. Keep the magic going with the firm belief that everybody's your friend and no one would dream of hijacking the party for their own selfish purposes. Maybe you'll be right this time. It's certainly worth a shot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
