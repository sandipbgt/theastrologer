You're extra creative now, which is useful whether you're at work or at home. And you can be a source of inspiration for other people, who may not feel as clear on their objectives as you do. If you get stuck on a certain point in a project, just talk or walk it out!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
