    "horoscope": "Your creativity is running strong today. You may have a hard time directing it, because there are so many enticing options beckoning to you. So why limit yourself? Play games with your family or work on your autobiography. Use your charm and imagination at work to win over your colleagues or a client. Whatever you do, your self-expression is sharp and witty today, and your words are truly eloquent.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
