    "horoscope": "You wake up in good spirits, and the day only gets better from there. Your self-confidence is high. Even if you meet a challenge, such as a disagreement with a coworker or a standoff with a friend, you're equal to it. And you can resolve disputes with a charming smile instead of a power display. This is true grace and assertiveness. You inhabit your power so naturally that no one questions it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
