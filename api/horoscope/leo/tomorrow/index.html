Not every adventure has to occur spontaneously, you know. Some of the best are the ones you plan in advance, and anticipate for a long time. This is a better day for staying home with the people you love, not gallivanting off in search of excitement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
