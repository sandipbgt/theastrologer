    "horoscope": "Your themes for today are balance and togetherness. Think of ways to combine these two ideals. You might cook a balanced meal to share with your family, or work on a project with your coworkers, making sure everyone has equal input. Your energy is high and your mood is positive, so you're in a great position to inspire others to be as creative and proactive as you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
