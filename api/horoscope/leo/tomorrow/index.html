    "horoscope": "Allow yourself to move slowly today. Don't push yourself to achieve something big and amazing, or to be bold when you don't feel very courageous at all. Instead, pamper yourself. Treat yourself with the sensitivity you'd show to a good friend who was having a hard day. Take a nap or a warm bath. Make yourself something nice to eat. These small indulgences will make you feel better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
