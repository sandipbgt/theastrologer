    "horoscope": "Before you start tossing around orders and harsh judgments, stop and consider -- who made you boss? People might soon find this attitude pretty tiresome. If you can't take a kinder point of view, today is going to be full of conflict. Turn that critical eye away from other people and toward yourself -- you know there's room for improvement. Focus on being a kinder, gentler person, and get some exercise to help burn off some of that steam.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
