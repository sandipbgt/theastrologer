Be sure to stay connected, with yourself as well as with the people and projects that matter to you most. This is where you truly shine. If you let the love and power flow through you, there's nothing you can't accomplish. Ride this wave of energy wherever you want to go, and be grateful for its blessings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
