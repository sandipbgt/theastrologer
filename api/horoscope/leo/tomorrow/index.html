    "horoscope": "Your mood could be a bit tricky today, because you aren't sure how to handle the emotional ups and downs you're currently experiencing. Any feelings of confusion or melancholy are passing, but your tendency now is to blow them out of proportion -- which isn't the most fun way to spend the day. Just try to stay calm, Leo. Be gentle with yourself and others. Any moodiness will pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
