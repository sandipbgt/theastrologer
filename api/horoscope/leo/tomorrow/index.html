    "horoscope": "You may sense distance today between yourself and someone you care about. If so, try not to take it too much to heart. Many people are in their own heads today, chasing down an idea or pursuing a cause they find personally meaningful. You might be preoccupied with an interesting topic or issue, yourself. So let everyone off the hook. It's time to think and make plans. Soon, you'll feel warmly social again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
