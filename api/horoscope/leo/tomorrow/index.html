    "horoscope": "Excellent times and blessed events happen when you pay attention. Take notes about what's going on. Your efforts are needed for teaching the people who still don't get it.

That's just crowd control, and you could give them so much more.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
