    "horoscope": "You could feel quite dramatic today. You're awash with emotion -- perhaps you're feeling sentimental or nostalgic, or perhaps you're in a romantic mood. Embody the emotion you feel. If you're feeling down, the best medicine for your soul is hugs from your loved ones. Even holding your beloved pet in your lap keeps your heart rate and blood pressure low. Surround yourself in a cocoon of love.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
