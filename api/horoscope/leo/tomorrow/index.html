    "horoscope": "You must admit that, at the moment, your logic is a wee bit  on the selfish side. You're looking out for your own interests, of course, but the question is, why? What has made you feel so vulnerable to others? Why are you hoarding your possessions and resources? Try being more generous today. Helping others should boost your ego and make you feel like the powerful, positive person you are, once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
