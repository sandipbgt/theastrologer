You're feeling the internal tension of knowing there's too much business that you need to take care of and not enough time to do it. The going may get tough. But take comfort in knowing that you're a hard, dedicated worker. You'll make sure you meet your goals and work to make them a reality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
