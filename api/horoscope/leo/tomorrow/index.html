Reach out via email or the phone, but don't spend the whole day parked in front of the computer -- unless that's truly your idea of adventure! Today should be about getting out of the house to enjoy new people, ideas and experiences. Embrace the world in all its weird, wonderful quirkiness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
