    "horoscope": "If you've spent a little too much time in your head lately, you're about to get the break you need. Today, be completely in your body. Enjoy being human. You're lithe and playful, whatever your shape and age, so get outside and stretch your muscles. Time spent with friends is also especially enjoyable so why not combine the two? Ask a pal to go jogging, or just visit with a few of your favorite people over dinner. It feels good to reconnect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
