    "horoscope": "At heart, you're a family person. Today is a good day to focus on the connections you share with loved ones, and the responsibilities you have toward them. An issue might arise at home that needs your input, or an old friend might call. Attending to your duties close to home brings you satisfaction now. So does reconnecting with the people who are dear to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
