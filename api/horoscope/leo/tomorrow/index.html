    "horoscope": "So you want to make your current project a big success and claim all the glory for yourself. That's understandable. But, really -- why are you being so tightlipped about it? Maybe that's why other people don't move when you push. They don't understand what you're trying to accomplish, or why you're not allowing them to get more directly involved. Share the plan and let others have a say in how this whole thing goes. Often, cooperation is smarter than playing the despotic ruler.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
