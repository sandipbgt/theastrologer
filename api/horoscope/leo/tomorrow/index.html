    "horoscope": "Today's emotional energy could leave you feeling a bit melancholy. You're in the kind of mood when old loves and losses resurface in your mind, and you mull them over to see if those old bruises still hurt. It's wise not to assign too much importance to a tender spot in your memory or your consciousness. In some sense, that's just your emotions playing tricks on you. This mood will wash away soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
