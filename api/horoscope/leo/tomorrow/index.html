A little effort goes a long way now, especially if you're putting your energy into your own life and health. Hit the gym for a cleansing workout, or revisit your budget and make sure it still reflects and accurate picture of your income and expenses. Sure, this might be a little boring, but tomorrow, you'll be glad you got so much done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
