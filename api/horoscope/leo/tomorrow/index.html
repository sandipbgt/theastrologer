    "horoscope": "You're a people-person, and you're used to warm, sunny moods. But today, dark feelings could intrude. You know better than to lash out in anger or behave possessively. But these are just the kind of behaviors lots of people are displaying now -- almost compulsively! Still, you do have control over yourself. The stronger your feelings are today, the more careful you should be in how you express them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
