    "horoscope": "This is a day for relaxing and enjoying yourself. Spend time with family and friends, and indulge in sensory pleasures like a sweet treat or a long, midday nap. The only word of caution here is to stay flexible. Your energy is smooth and grounded, but your stubborn streak is also strong now, especially if someone tosses an unexpected obstacle in your path. Try to be reasonable, even during a disagreement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
