    "horoscope": "Your next big thing might look like a vainglorious puff piece to your critics. Or maybe your critique of their sincere efforts is sounding harsh or foolish. Maybe they're right by their standards. And maybe those standards aren't right for you. Stop trying so hard to live up to such things. It doesn't mean you have to become a hermit. It just means that you should probably dial back the pressure today as you look for people on your own wavelength. You'll know you've found them when they indulge your whims instead of condemning you for them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
