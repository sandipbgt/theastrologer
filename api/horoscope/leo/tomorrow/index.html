    "horoscope": "A sense of inner calm helps you settle in to your work today. Social activity may quiet down for a day or two, allowing you to focus on the task at hand. Stay organized as you move through your responsibilities. Make a detailed list and cross off items as you complete them. Under the current influence, that's one of the best ways to stay on top of your business.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
