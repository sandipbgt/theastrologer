    "horoscope": "Perhaps you've hit an impasse with a friend, or maybe you're in the middle of a disagreement at the office. Whatever's going on, it looks like there's a day-long standoff ahead. Good thing you're not too proud to mediate between combatants. Put that warm heart of yours to work and make everyone feel at ease. That way, people will loosen up and talk things out instead of shouting. This may be less exciting than an all-out war, but it certainly is a lot safer! And more easily resolved.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
