    "horoscope": "Today, your usual, extroverted self turns inward as responsibilities claim your attention. Work may demand extra hours, or family duties might weigh on your mind. This could even seem a bit depressing. But the best you can do is to carry your burdens gracefully. Life won't stay difficult for long, so focus now. Be thorough and methodical, and cover all your bases. That way, you won't have to redo anything later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
