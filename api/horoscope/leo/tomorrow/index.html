    "horoscope": "You wake up in a loving mood, in need of closeness and affection. Even if you have a lot of work to do today, be sure to spend some time with loved ones, too, because it's reassuring to know those connections are still strong. Of course, work makes you feel secure in a different way, and that's important now, too. Strike a balance between soothing your need for emotional connection and your need for financial stability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
