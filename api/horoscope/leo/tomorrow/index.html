    "horoscope": "Self-importance could isolate you today. You're in a bit of a mood, and your normal humor seems to have gone into hiding. You're taking everything a little too seriously, including yourself -- and someone might say something that really gets under your skin. But before you react self-righteously, stop and consider whether you really want to sacrifice a friendship. Do you really require that much privacy and respect? Cool down for a couple of days and see if things snap back into proportion again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
