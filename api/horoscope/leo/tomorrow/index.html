Soak up this ego validation; you can draw from it later, when you might not feel quite so strong or centered. But for now, insecurities are not an issue. Take the day to review where you've been so far, and brainstorm some ideas for the future. You can take even bigger strides with just a little foresight and planning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
