But don't get discouraged if you don't feel the love. Just keep your head down, and put one foot in front of the other. Think of this as an endurance test. Perhaps it's even more important to prove to yourself that you can work through a rough spot gracefully.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
