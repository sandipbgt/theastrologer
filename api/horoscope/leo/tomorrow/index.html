Enjoy a sense of personal power as your friends and relatives acknowledge your natural leadership, even if that's a role you haven't yet fully embodied. Light up the room with your jokes and antics, too, but don't forget to share the spotlight. After all, a crucial part of leading others is to help them feel important, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
