    "horoscope": "Someone doesn't understand you today, and it's getting a little old. You could both slink off to separate corners, wounded and defensive, but this response won't get you anywhere except further apart. So fire up your courage and explain your position -- calmly, with no dramatic language or gestures. Then give the other person a chance to talk. If they give you input on your behavior, try to listen. It could really help you improve.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
