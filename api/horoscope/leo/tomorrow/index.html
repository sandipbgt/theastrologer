    "horoscope": "Your warm heart and sunny spirit make cooperation easy today. Even when it comes to sticky issues, people want to get along, because they value your friendship and trust. This works to your advantage as you manage projects, do your work and gather with friends today. When it comes to goodwill, you can put a lot of brownie points in the bank now. Then you'll have them later, in more trying times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
