    "horoscope": "You have an open mind and a gregarious style, and your best qualities -- courage, warmth, generosity -- are on full display today. This is no time to go it alone, so use your friendly, charming personality to get other people involved in the cause of your choice. Surprise, surprise -- others care about the same goals and projects you do! And it's easy to integrate friends and allies into your efforts. Forming a strong team will help get things off the ground and running smoothly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
