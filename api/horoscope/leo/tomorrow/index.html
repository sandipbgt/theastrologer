    "horoscope": "You're a natural performer. The spotlight becomes you, and you're at your best when all eyes are turned in your direction.

And at a business meeting, you can be instrumental in securing the support or resources needed to get the job done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
