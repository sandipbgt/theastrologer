    "horoscope": "Today you're interested in everyone you encounter. You want to hear their ideas, even if they differ from your own. Hey, maybe you can teach each other a thing or two! It's a great day to consciously embrace new experiences. If you go out to eat, choose ethnic food you haven't tried before. If you're at a party, seek out unfamiliar faces and strike up a conversation. Broaden your horizons, Leo.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
