    "horoscope": "Feelings of vulnerability could set in today, especially if you can't connect with loved ones. If you're on a business trip, or if your spouse or best friend is busy or unavailable, you might feel lonely indeed. But remember that you're actually surrounded by love, even if you have to spend the day alone. Furthermore, this influence is short-lived. Any heavy emotions will lift soon, and you'll return to your spirited, optimistic self.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
