    "horoscope": "Be polite and gracious. Go beyond your circle of friends and into the neighborhood. Connect with the people who missed out on chances they should have had. Show your eagerness to help. Maybe you think you know what they want, but do them the courtesy of asking anyway. Obviously this Good Samaritan business has a social networking angle, too. You probably wouldn't mind hooking up with some of these people to whom you're reaching out. And if you can make it work for you on more than one level, well, it'll be your lucky day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
