Sing and dance to the music in your heart, and it won't matter whether you look like an amateur or a pro. Flirt and promise, but leave yourself enough wiggle room to keep any new commitments from hardening into a prison. Your appeal is legendary, which should explain why they're lining up to see you. In case you hadn't noticed, your world is changing for the better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
