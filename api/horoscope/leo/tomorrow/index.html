    "horoscope": "An old problem or debate is revisited today, and you bring new vitality to the issue. Instead of sighing or rolling their eyes, people are perking up and listening to what you have to say. And as long as you're straightforward in your questions and answers, they'll give you the floor. You help everyone talk again. Before you know it, this issue will be resolved, clearing the way for another exciting surge of forward movement. All thanks to you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
