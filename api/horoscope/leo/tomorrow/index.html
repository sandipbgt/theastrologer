    "horoscope": "You may feel anxious or needy today. You're guarding your own boundaries, even with those close to you. And the worst part is, even as you're barking at them about respecting your needs and boundaries, you aren't being nearly so considerate about theirs. Give them their space. They could probably use a break from you, at least as long as you're in this state of mind. Soon you'll be back to your normal loving self.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
