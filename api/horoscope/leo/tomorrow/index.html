    "horoscope": "Power has its uses, no question about that. But at this point it can be more of an exercise in vanity than anything else. Does it really matter how many points you rack up? Aggressive acts will reflect badly on you, even if you're seizing control with only the best intentions. Pushing someone around for their own good won't be very good for you.
