    "horoscope": "You're a legend in your own mind, but perhaps you should keep that quiet for now. Humility goes a long way, you know, whereas pride gets you into trouble. Today, any performance, no matter how passionate or compelling, will look like you're showing off. So play the role of the modest, hardworking devotee. Then, if you're still feeling like an unsung hero, you can start advertising your success. Just don't be surprised if people roll their eyes instead of applauding.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
