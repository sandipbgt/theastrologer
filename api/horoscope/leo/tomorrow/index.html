Your priority now is to spend as much time as possible with friends and loved ones, so accept any and all invitations you receive -- and put on your dancing shoes! Actually, you may spend more time chatting in a group of friends than heating it up out on the dance floor, but either way, you'll make a fun connection with anyone who crosses your path.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
