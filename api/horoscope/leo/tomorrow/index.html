And freeing yourself in this way is a wonderful use of the current cosmic energy. If you can take a trip someplace new, or plan one for the future, so much better. Even just daydreaming about the places you'd like to go is fun and productive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
