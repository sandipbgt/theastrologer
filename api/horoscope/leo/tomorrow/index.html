    "horoscope": "Your vanity may triumph today if the wrong people keep saying you're beautiful, always right, or off the hook for something you did wrong. Things may be changing, and adapting to a new system won't be easy if you have to start from the bottom. Chilly silence at inappropriate jokes might be the first indication that you crossed the line. Stop fighting for what doesn't matter anymore. Make your peace now before the battle even begins. So what if someone laughs at you for surrendering? Don't let them drag you into their downward spiral. Rise up instead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
