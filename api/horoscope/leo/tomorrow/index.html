    "horoscope": "Don't spend time alone today if you don't have to. You're gregarious and talkative, and very much in the mood to be around other people. Interesting conversations claim your attention, and you have a lot to add to any group discussion. And you aren't just joking around, either -- though your clever jests will win others over. But you're keen-minded and creative enough to utilize the good will your friendliness creates.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
