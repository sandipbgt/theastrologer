    "horoscope": "Life could feel a little rough today. But really, it's just that you're more emotionally sensitive than usual. Of course, you've always been a softie. You might fool people with your bold, courageous personality, but you can actually feel quite insecure. Today, that comes out in vague worries or a general sense of discouragement. Reality seems harsh. But remember, it's all a matter of perspective. Soon, you'll feel strong again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
