    "horoscope": "A swell of intense energy could make things very interesting today. Do your best to stay stable, or at least rational. It might be fun to ride out this wave of power and see wherever it takes you, but it would be a real shame to waste it. The best use of it might be on a creative project. Do your best to continue working with other people, even as you assert your own vision of the process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
