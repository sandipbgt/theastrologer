    "horoscope": "You're graceful, intense, and in the moment, and it feels great. You'll naturally claim the spotlight, whether at thecooler or a dinner party, mingling with old friends and new admirers. You're putting out an incredibly magnetic vibe, and everyone's drawn in. But what about tomorrow? That's worth considering. Today could amount to a lot more than passing fun, if you put your mind to it. Take appropriate steps if you want to start something that lasts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
