    "horoscope": "This is a day of possibility, and the universe is on your side. Life feels almost too easy -- opportunities just fall into your lap. Even if there's a lull in activity, you just feel good. Anything can happen -- enjoy the lighthearted romp, and stay open to new adventures. Maybe you'll end up losing your heart to someone as special as you are. Maybe you'll just reconnect with friends and reaffirm your joy of life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
