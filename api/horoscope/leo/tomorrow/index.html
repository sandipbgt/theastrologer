    "horoscope": "You may be distracted at best today, or you could feel downright confused. Your thoughts and feelings are all in a muddle. But don't try too hard to make sense of them. Just go with your heart. In fact, it's a great day for romance. See a mushy movie with a friend, or give your sweetheart a hug. Let yourself dream a little. Days like this are perfect for indulging in sweet imagination.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
