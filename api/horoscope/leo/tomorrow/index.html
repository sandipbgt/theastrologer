The same goes for any creative projects you're working on -- it can even apply to gardening. Whatever you're up to today, don't limit yourself with narrow-minded thinking. That will only lead you into a corner. It's better just to go smart and unique from the start.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
