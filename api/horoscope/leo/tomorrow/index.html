    "horoscope": "Your creativity is strong today. You're seeing life in vivid color. If you're artistically inclined, indulge that part of your spirit by beginning a new painting, sculpture or whatever your medium might be. Of course, even if you think you aren't an artist, you probably are. You have an eye for style and composition. Put it to good use today, even just by wearing an outfit that makes you feel attractive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
