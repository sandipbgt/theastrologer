Even just cooking a new dish for dinner is a fun activity, because it awakens your senses -- and of course, it's even better if you can share the experience with someone you care about. Artistic projects let you express parts of yourself that you might normally ignore. Pursue anything that uses your imagination today,. You'll be better for it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
