    "horoscope": "You're loyal and punctual, to your credit. Try not to get frustrated with everyone else today. To their discredit, they're fickle and late. What's gotten into them? The current energy is widening people's perfectionist streaks. This could explain their lack of promptness. Maybe they're too busy trying to get things just so. It's hard to call something 'good enough' when you're not convinced that 'good enough' exists. Give everyone time before you quit. You can afford to be patient. Later, you'll be glad you were.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
