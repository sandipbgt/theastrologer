All that's different today is your point of view. You're more tuned in to your own worries, insecurities and general vulnerability than usual. Don't place too much importance on any dark or discouraged thoughts that come to you today. Keep your sense of faith intact.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
