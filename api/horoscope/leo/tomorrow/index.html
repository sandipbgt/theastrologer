You're filled with positive energy and you're in touch with what you value most in life. Go beyond mere physical pleasure into a much more important realm. If you tap into your exuberance and use it for mental pursuits, you'll find you can reach some great results. So focus on an important project and put all your brainpower into it. That way, you'll really get somewhere.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
