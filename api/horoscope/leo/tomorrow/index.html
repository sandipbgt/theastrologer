    "horoscope": "There's just no room in your heart at the moment for anything other than pure appreciation and enjoyment of the blessings you've been given. In every situation you get into today, call it as you see it. Your friends appreciate your warmth and honesty, and they want to join your team. In fact, with a little creativity, you could put this positive energy and goodwill to good use. Don't neglect the power of a group of friends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
