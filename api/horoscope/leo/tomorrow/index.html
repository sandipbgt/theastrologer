    "horoscope": "Even if you're feeling grouchy and insecure, you still can't take it out on everyone around you. Morose glares and sneering replies won't endear you to anyone, and deep down, you know that. So draw on your inner actor and pretend you're in a much better frame of mind. If you smile at people, they'll smile back. If you look for a compromise,, they're a lot more likely to want to work with you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
