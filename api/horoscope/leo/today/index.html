    "horoscope": "Be absolutely clear about what you're offering now. You have the chops, the witnesses and the resume. You rule wherever authority is demanded. They're calling you capable, but what kind of word is that? It sounds so lukewarm and lackluster. They say you're good, but that's a little vague, too. Do something even better today. Rise above all that neutral language to be great, awesome and world-rocking. Seize your rare, perfect moment with all the passion in your body and spirit. One you embrace the right opportunity, it won't want to leave you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
