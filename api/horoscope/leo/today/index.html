    "horoscope": "You're in the mood for company, and you're interested in anyone new and different whom you happen to encounter. You might end up talking today with someone who expands your intellectual horizons, whose unusual ideas challenge your own and force you to think just a bit outside your comfortable yet limiting box. This is good for you, Leo. It's all too easy for you to slip into routine, even rigid thought patterns.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
