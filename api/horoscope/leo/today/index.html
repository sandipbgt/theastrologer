    "horoscope": "Perhaps you have been in a whirlwind. Maybe all has been rolling along smoothly. Either way, today you're calm and composed. Your friends and family will marvel at how on top of things you seem. Maybe you'll marvel at yourself. But are you really as together as you seem? No matter. The illusion of safety and stability may be enough for today. You're pretty good at bluffing.
