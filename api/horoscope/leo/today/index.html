But on days like today, it's a good idea to avoid any and all theatrics, whether your own or someone else's. Emotional turmoil can certainly be thrilling in its own way. But right now, when many people are feeling especially sensitive, it isn't the best time to court a crisis.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
