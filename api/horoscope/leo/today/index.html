    "horoscope": "You're in a somber mood today. You seem to prefer a dark style, and it could affect your mood. Maybe the dark mood came first, and the somber attitude followed. Regardless, you don't have to live in humorless drudgery. Brightening your appearance is an easy and effective way to brighten your outlook. Put on something colorful and go for a walk out in the sunlight. If the weather's bad, make some hot cocoa and cuddle up with a good book or someone special. You'll blast through this melancholy yet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
