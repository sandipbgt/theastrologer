    "horoscope": "Old worries or insecurities from your past may rear their ugly little heads today. Even issues you thought you'd dealt with could make a return visit, which is dismaying. You thought you'd already processed those feelings! If old wounds are reopened now, do your best not to attach too much importance to them. Emotional upsets are blessedly short-lived, and you're sure to be feeling strong again in no time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
