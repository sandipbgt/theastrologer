    "horoscope": "It's a wonderful day to expand your horizons. This is possible no matter how much cash or free time you have. Taking a trip to someplace new would be optimal. Exploring unfamiliar locations is one of the best expressions of the current energy. But reading up on an interesting subject works, too. So does trying out a new restaurant or seeing a foreign film. Find some way to broaden your world view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
