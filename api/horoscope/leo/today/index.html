    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if your energy is a bit low today. Somehow, your usual passion andis subdued. This doesn't have to be a bad thing. Maybe it's just the universe signaling you to slow down for a day or two. It's a great time to take a nap, read a book or write in your journal. Watching movies is also fun, especially if a friend or loved one joins you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
