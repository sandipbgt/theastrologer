    "horoscope": "Group efforts are highlighted today, so join forces with like-minded people. There's power in numbers, and there's something very creative about bouncing your thoughts off other people. But to make this process work for you, it's important to set your ego aside. If someone challenges one of your pet theories, don't take it personally. That's what teamwork is for: to help you generate your best, brightest and most workable ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
