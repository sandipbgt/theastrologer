    "horoscope": "High spirits make you gregarious today. You're drawn to groups of people. You crave that human contact, whether it's with friends, coworkers or even strangers at the grocery store! Be sure to do something with this energy. Being sociable is great, but it's more important to take advantage of the group dynamic to get something useful accomplished. Put your heads together, come up with a plan, and make it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
