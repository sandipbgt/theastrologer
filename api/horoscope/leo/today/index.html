    "horoscope": "A strange vibe descends over your world today. Vague concerns could send you looking for something solid to cling to. Do what's necessary to feel safe and grounded, but try not to be too stubborn in your views. Sometimes, when you're feeling uncertain about life, you dig your heels in. But an adventurous, trusting approach would be better now. Summon your courage,. Everything is going to be fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
