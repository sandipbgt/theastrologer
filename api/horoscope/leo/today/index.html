You want to show people what you're all about -- what really makes you unique. Just make sure you aren't grasping at eccentricity for its own sake. There's nothing wrong with being conventional. Most of all, there's nothing wrong with being yourself, even if you secretly worry that's a little dull.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
