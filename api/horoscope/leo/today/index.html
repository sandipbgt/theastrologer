    "horoscope": "Today you're resistant to change. You might even get snarly with anyone who presents new ideas -- even if those ideas are solid ones. You just like to be in charge, don't you? And if the current methods are working, well, why change? But you're presuming a lot about how much others will tolerate from you. It would be best not to drive them away with your bad mood.  Loosen your grip and let someone else have some input.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
