    "horoscope": "Today you crave closeness and connection with the people you love. An affirmation of that wonderful bond can have almost narcotic intensity, and can create a really special day. You might even move to a new level of trust and intimacy in a personal relationship. Of course, the same might happen through a tough discussion or even an argument. Do your best to be honest yet loving as you express your feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
