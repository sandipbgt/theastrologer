    "horoscope": "Jacks- and Jills-of-all-trades are climbing higher hills. And there will be no falling down and breaking your crowns, please and thank you! Even without the nursery rhyme references, your ambitions will lead you upward. This ought to feel natural today, or maybe longer if you can stay focused on your own little slice of that big pie in the sky. And your warm, sensitive heart will keep you from steamrolling every little thing that gets in your way. More than anything else, ruthless competition would be the thing most likely to send you tumbling back down.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
