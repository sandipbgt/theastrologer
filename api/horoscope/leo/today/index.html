    "horoscope": "Now you're on track. Optimism drives your thoughts and zest for life drives the other parts, so you're good to go on all levels. Your speed and determination will put you in the right place at the right time today, ready to haul in all the good stuff. Store or share what you can't use. It would be a crime to waste any of this. And the more you share, the bigger your return. How many dates and parties will spring from this little binge of good judgment? Keep your schedule open and start counting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
