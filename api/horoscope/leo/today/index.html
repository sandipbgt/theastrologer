    "horoscope": "It's a good day to think critically. Whether you're chatting with a friend or working on a professional project, focus on the details. Be analytical as you weigh out your options and form a cohesive picture or plan. Your usual instinct is to view life through an emotional lens. But right now, communicating and operating in a more judicious, levelheaded way will help you make the most of your current energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
