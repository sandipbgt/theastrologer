    "horoscope": "You can use your authority as an act of faith today. In this case, 'act' will mean taking action, not playing make-believe in front of an audience. Because if you truly believe in what you're doing, your story won't change and others will be more likely to follow where you lead. But if you're just going through the motions, whether you're trying to mislead them or even convince yourself, your logic won't hold up. They'll know you're faking it. Wouldn't that be a little embarrassing? Don't let it happen, and you'll never have to find out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
