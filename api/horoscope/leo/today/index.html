    "horoscope": "Now you're a major player, a motivational speaker and a moving target. How do you make time for all that? It's easy enough. You're a dedicated friend, but you won't let that interfere too much with your plans. The fact is, friendship aside, you also have to be quick on your feet if you want a bigger slice of the pie. Of course you'll be a good provider to anyone who believes that you'll be coming back. Share what you come up with today. All gain doesn't have to be selfish, especially if you gather enough to go around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
