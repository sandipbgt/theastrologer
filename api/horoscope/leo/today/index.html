    "horoscope": "Today, your competitive side comes to the fore. You want your skills to be recognized, but things may get tricky if you feel you didn't do your best. And if someone tries to steal your thunder, watch out! Go easy on yourself, and give others the benefit of the doubt. Most people are trying to get ahead right now. Do your best, and trust that your performance will speak for itself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
