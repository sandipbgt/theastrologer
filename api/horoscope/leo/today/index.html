    "horoscope": "Emotional vulnerability can be an issue today -- even for you, the courageous Lion. Life might seem a little too harsh, or, on the flip side, so sweet it makes your teeth hurt. Either way, you can experience a sense of disappointment or disillusionment. But if this happens, try to remember that it's just an impression, and a fleeting one.
