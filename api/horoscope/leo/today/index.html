    "horoscope": "First impressions and first takes certainly have their appeal. Then there's love at first sight. Yes, you're clearly ready for an experience, but don't get attached too soon. You'll have many more choices today. Are you in a situation where more is better, or are you already locked in to something less than ideal? Understand the difference between going for what you deserve and just being selfish. Use your common sense instead of relying totally on your appetite, because willful acts might appear childish in an adult world. Wait your turn and gain some respect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
