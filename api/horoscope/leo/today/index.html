You enjoy being the leader in a group setting, and your creative ideas and natural charisma make it easy for other people to follow your example. After all, someone has to lead the group toward greatness! This is your strength, and today, you embody it naturally.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
