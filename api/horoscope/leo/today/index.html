    "horoscope": "It's important to be thorough in everything you do. Cutting corners today means you'll redo something tomorrow. But paying close attention to craftsmanship, on the other hand, will bring you great satisfaction. This taps into your artist's soul -- the part of you that appreciates style, beauty and fine lines. And you can bring this principle to your life no matter what your job or hobby might be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
