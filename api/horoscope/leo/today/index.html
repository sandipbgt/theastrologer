Your emotions are roiling inside you likeset to a boil, and you aren't being very discriminating in how you express them or when. The truth is, you may not even know why you're feeling these ways -- stubborn, angry, vulnerable, jealous, upset. At least you're feeling your emotions fully, which helps soothe them more quickly. Still, try not to unleash them on unsuspecting victims.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
