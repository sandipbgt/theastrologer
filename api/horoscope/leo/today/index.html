    "horoscope": "Forward thinking is highlighted today. And no one is more naturally creative than you. But as you work on a project, make sure you aren't thinking outside the box simply for the sake of nonconformity. It isn't enough just to be wacky and weird. Any forward motion today will come from building on tradition. That means taking the best, strongest parts of your existing knowledge, and then trying new ideas to see what works.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
