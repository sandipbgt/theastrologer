    "horoscope": "You're feeling quite passionate today. This is a good thing as long as your connections with other people stay positive. But if any difficult feelings begin to develop, such as self-doubt, embarrassment or fear of rejection, a sweet situation could get sticky fast. Watch out for the tendency toward possessive or obsessive behavior. The current influence could make you fixate in an unhealthy way on someone or something you desire.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
