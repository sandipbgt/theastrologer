    "horoscope": "A grim sense of responsibility may hang over you today. The current influence makes you quite conscious of any ways in which you feel you fall short of someone's expectations -- your own, perhaps, or those of your family or employer. But don't be so hard on yourself! Anyone who knows you knows that you're a hardworking, loyal person. Instead of focusing on your shortcomings, focus on your strengths.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
