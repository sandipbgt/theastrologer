    "horoscope": "There's no holding back today on any level. Plan to get some exercise, or do something else physical, like going out dancing. Even just swaying in your living room to the throbbing beat of world music is fun -- anything that gets you moving. And having kids around only enhances the mood. Any type of spontaneous laughter or game is a great idea today. Just have a good time. This is where you shine,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
