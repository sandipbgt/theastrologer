    "horoscope": "You're extra generous today. You want everyone to enjoy life to the fullest! You'll go out of your way to make sure folks are comfortable and happy. If you have a chance to host a gathering of loved ones, you'll find it the perfect venue for your energies. Just stay loose. You have a strong vision of how you want things to go, but there's a lot to be said for flexibility, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
