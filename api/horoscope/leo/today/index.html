    "horoscope": "You're naturally courageous, but for today, it's even easier to access that part of your character. For one thing, you know you're blessed: Your energy is high, you're in a great mood, and the laws of the land and nature are on your side. Now you can draw on your experience to shape what happens next -- and that will be whatever you want it to be. You're in charge, because you're thinking so positively. This mood is like gold. Keep it going by spreading it around and trusting in its simple goodness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
