    "horoscope": "The comforts of home appeal to you today. This is even truer if you're feeling a bit blue and teary-eyed, which is common under the current influence. Emotional ups and downs can be smoothed out by spending time with trusted friends, especially those who know how to help when you're in this mood. Having your own needs met enables you to step outside your own needs and help someone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
