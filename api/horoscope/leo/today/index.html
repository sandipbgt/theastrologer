    "horoscope": "Though you're used to being active, today is more a day for passive reflection. It's a good time to get some extra sleep or to plan low-key, home-based activities. Naps are especially nice now! Let your mind wander as emotional impressions come and go. If you push yourself to do anything more strenuous, you'll only wear yourself out. It's time to take a day off from your usual high-energy approach to life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
