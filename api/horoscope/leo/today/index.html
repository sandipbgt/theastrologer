You're aware of the opportunities out there and ready to grab hold of them. So whether you're tackling a new or established project, you'll bring a little extra 'oomph' to it. Putting your new ideas into action is even easier with help on your side, so turn your inspiring perspective toward your friends and colleagues. They're sure to be impressed with your vision and your energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
