    "horoscope": "You're likely to hold yourself to high standards today. Your inner critic is prominent, as are any external critics you may have in your life, such as your parents, spouse or employer. Right now it's especially important to know when something is good enough. Going over and over the details is a waste of time and energy. Plus, it will just drive you crazy! Being practical is being kind to yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
