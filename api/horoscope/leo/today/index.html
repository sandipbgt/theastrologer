    "horoscope": "Creativity provides you with a wonderful escape today. Your imagination is very active -- in fact, it might be overactive. This is one of those days when vague emotions could make you uncomfortable. But you can turn this into a positive by using your feelings and impressions in a creative way. For example, you might paint images from a dream, or use it as the basis for a song or a short story.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
