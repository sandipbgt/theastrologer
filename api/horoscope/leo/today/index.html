    "horoscope": "Are you aware of what you can do when you put your mind and your back into it? If not, you're about to find out. Bring your determination and concentration online until your world is humming with constant power. Focus all that energy on your objective today, whether you're trying to break a world record, win somebody's doubting heart or make your first million. Why can't you do all this and more? You feel like laughing in the face of the impossible. You know you're right, and you'll prove it, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
