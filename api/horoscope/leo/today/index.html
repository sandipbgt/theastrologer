    "horoscope": "Stay grounded in reality today. For example, if you receive feedback on your work, take it for what it is -- someone's effort to help you improve your skills. There's no need to get upset or emotional about it. Similarly, if you're making plans for the future, be conscious of real limitations like time and money. Stay well within your budget, since things tend to expand once you get going.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
