    "horoscope": "Aggravation and thwarted effort screw up your day today. Maybe you're suffering from excessive ambition and a closed budget. If so, try scaling back. If you redirect your funds more realistically, you'll greatly lessen your stress, which will make things seem a lot more manageable. Before you know it, your usual sunny, optimistic outlook will return -- and then you'll achieve even bigger things than you originally thought possible. Start the process now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
