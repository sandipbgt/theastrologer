Or maybe you're fantasizing about telling everyone you're outta here, off to get the understanding and appreciation you deserve. But revenge and grandstanding won't get you anywhere. Soothe your wounded soul by simplifying your life and being realistic about your options. You don't really want to say 'sayonara' to all your friends, after all. They love you, even if they sometimes get under your skin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
