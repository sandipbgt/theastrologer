    "horoscope": "Look at all these fish in the sea. Look at all the beautiful people hanging out in this garden of earthly delights. Maybe you're feeling amorous and available, but you have standards. You have a keen eye for the ideal partner, and it might take a sharp poke to keep you looking. Put your best side on display, since Mr. or Ms. Right could be looking for you. Meanwhile, if you're not in the market for love, use today to get a better job, hustle up some new clients or find the best deal in town.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
