You want to enjoy yourself, but there's a good chance that you'll use sweet treats to give you the illusion of filling an emotional void. That's not such a bad thing, in itself -- as long as you don't overdo it so much that you develop a stomachache! Try to practice some common sense, even as you let yourself indulge a little.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
