Either way, it's a comfort to be in familiar surroundings, or to connect with loved ones. This feels good because it puts you in touch with your roots. You spend so much of your life growing upward and outward, it's nice to be reminded of where you came from.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
