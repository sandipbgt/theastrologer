This is also a good time to settle an issue with a friend or even to say goodbye to a person or behavior that no longer plays a positive role in your life. You'll have less anxiety than usual about letting go, because the moment is simply right for it. Plus, neat endings appeal to you. Other people can benefit from this mood of yours, too. Share the beauty of an elegant solution.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
