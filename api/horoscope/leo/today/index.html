Go ahead and splurge a little on new dishes, curtains or furniture if you'd like, because your creative energy is humming and you always have good taste. Better yet, paint a picture you can hang on the wall, or sculpt something you can put on display. Anything that puts home and creativity together today is a good bet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
