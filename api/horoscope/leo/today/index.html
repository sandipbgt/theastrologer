    "horoscope": "Your personal honor swells, and for good reason. You're more radiant than usual, and people are really taking notice. This is a great day to try something new. Whatever it is, it could take a few days to master, but you'll get the hang of it, and will be a master within a few weeks. A little daring now could pay off in a big way later, so aim high when you choose a goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
