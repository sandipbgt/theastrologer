This is the perfect time to reconnect with long-lost friends, because you're in the mood for conversation and your positivity will only strengthen your bonds. A funny joke or a heartwarming story can be as good as a hug -- so can a simple, truthful statement from the heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
