    "horoscope": "Your personality is always bright and strong, but today it's even bigger than usual. Perhaps this is because you're feeling things so intensely, and your opinions are so closely connected with your sense of self.

Try to embrace diverse perspectives.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
