    "horoscope": "Stay focused on your work today. An attitude of quiet efficiency is your best bet right now. Respect for others is also high on the list -- especially for VIPs like your clients or superiors. Show them you have their best interests in mind by putting in concentrated effort. This is all about working smart, though not necessarily hard. If you put in the time now, you'll certainly reap the benefits later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
