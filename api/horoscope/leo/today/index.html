    "horoscope": "Try to stay calm and open-minded today. In conversations with friends or business associates, you may cling too tightly to your own point of view, making it difficult to consider others' opinions. But if you slow down and loosen up a little, you may realize they have a good point. So don't worry about being right, or trying too hard to convince others of something. Relax, and listen. That will reveal the truth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
