    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic influence brings you a unique opportunity to change and grow emotionally, if you want to. If you react to people and situations on instinct instead of acting deliberately, you're more likely to behave in ways you'll regret. It's easy to regress to immature behaviors when someone hurts your feelings. But choosing to handle emotional challenges in a mature way helps you create opportunities for personal growth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
