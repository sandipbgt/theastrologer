Folks won't mind you pushing them back toward happiness; not when it's your voice stirring optimism into their gloomy mix. Yes, sing your songs. Tell your stories and jokes. Share your life experiences and break out the maps that will help them find a better road out of wherever they are. It's finally time to bring all those natural talents of yours  into play. It's time to start changing your world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
