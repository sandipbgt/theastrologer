    "horoscope": "You're fiery but self-contained, and that's exactly as it should be. There's no need to orchestrate anything to get more attention -- you're gaining enough as it is. People are really digging your passionate, magnetic personality, and you're not even trying to impress them. Keep things on a lower flame for another day. Your grand equations will prove themselves in the end, and you'll get major karmic brownie points for not tooting your own horn.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
