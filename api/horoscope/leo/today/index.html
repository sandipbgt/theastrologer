But while you're expansive, you know your limits. Use that skill to pull it all together today. If you're focused on achieving a goal, you'll let your actions make a statement. That, in turn, will draw not just admirers to your side, but allies -- people who can help you get where you're trying to go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
