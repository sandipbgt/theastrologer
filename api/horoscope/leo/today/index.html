    "horoscope": "A good mood has you humming. Your nimble grace and positive, loving attitude are your gifts to give the world today. It's easy to move among your friends, gracing everyone with a smile. They're all glad to see you, you know. And it's up to you how you apply this energy. You can use this brief period for a bit of fun and relaxation, or you can accomplish something more meaningful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
