    "horoscope": "Your mind is especially active today, and your creativity is even stronger than usual. Ideas are sparking left and right! The only question is which one you'll choose to focus on first. But that shouldn't be a problem. The only thing that might stand in your way is simple distraction. Everywhere you turn, there's someone new and interesting to talk to. Even that is okay, since your conversations will inspire even brighter concepts!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
