    "horoscope": "It's good to look deeply within yourself and increase your self-awareness, but don't be hard on yourself during that vulnerable process.

Talk your issues over with a trusted friend or therapist. See if you can find the light at the end of the tunnel.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
