You're in too good a mood to waste your time moping around! Be a good example for someone else who isn't feeling quite as peppy. Show them how easy it is to keep your chin up, simply by acting like life is fun and opportunities are yours for the taking.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
