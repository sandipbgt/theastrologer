    "horoscope": "You must admit that, at the moment, your logic is a wee bit  on the selfish side. You're looking out for your own interests, of course, but the question is, why?

Helping others should boost your ego and make you feel like the powerful, positive person you are, once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
