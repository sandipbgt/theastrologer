    "horoscope": "Today marks the start of a brand-new cycle of your life, one that will last for at least a month. You're starting over on every level, and you couldn't be more ready for this. Wherever you go and whatever you do, today will be full of promises, kickoffs and launches. Eventually, of course, you'll have to buckle down and put in some hard work, but for now, you're going on pure instinct and energy, and it's working!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
