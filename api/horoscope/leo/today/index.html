    "horoscope": "Face it -- you're in love with life. Actually, life has been in love with you for as long as you can remember, now that you cast new light on the evidence. Fierce passion will underline every gesture you make toward others. And they are always grateful to receive anything from you. Start being more generous toward loved ones and strangers. Keep that smile on your face and that song in your heart, and today the world will eat out of your hand. Naturally, you'll feed it only the best, right?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
