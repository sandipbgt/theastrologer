    "horoscope": "It's hard to share the spotlight with other people when you want it for yourself. But that's just the kind of situation you'll have to navigate today, when teamwork is more important than personal glory. This holds true even if someone steps on your toes, taking credit for something you accomplished. If this happens, remember that it's all about the good of the group. In the end, that's the goal that matters most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
