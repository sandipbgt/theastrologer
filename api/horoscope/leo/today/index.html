    "horoscope": "Today, you might get caught up in thinking that it's critically important to impress someone with your hard work and diligence. You might bend over backward trying to gain the admiration of your employer, a client or a friend. If you're working toward professional goals, you may be doing the smart thing. But don't take yourself too seriously. Just do your thing. Sometimes it takes time for a good impression to catch on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
