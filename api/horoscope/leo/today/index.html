    "horoscope": "Your thoughts will be far-reaching today, or maybe even beyond. Why set limits on what you can do? And while you're at it, why not hang with other cerebral types as you peer through this sudden window of opportunity? Trust them to bring all of their brainpower and as little ego as possible. Put your heads together and come up with some truly great ideas. Wait until later to haggle over the intellectual property rights. By the time it gets to that point, there might be enough profit to go around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
