    "horoscope": "If your feelings are stronger than usual today, you aren't alone. Tears might spring to your eyes at the slightest provocation, but this isn't a bad thing. It means you're a deeply emotional person, and right now, that side of you is right at the surface. Again, you aren't the only one! Lots of people are highly affected by sad or poignant stories. Be glad you're so emotionally attuned to the world around you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
