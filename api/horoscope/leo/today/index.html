Your natural creativity is heightened now, which could be a very good thing, especially if you work in a creative field or if you're an artist of some kind. Be sure to let your imagination roam, so you can tap into the wealth of inspiration available.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
