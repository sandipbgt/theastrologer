They can tell you're speaking from the heart, and you're as lighthearted and confident as you seem. It's easy to express your thoughts and ideas, especially in groups. It's as if you can see the light bulbs turning on in other people's heads, and that inspires you back. Everyone's learning something new today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
