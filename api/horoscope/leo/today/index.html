    "horoscope": "If you seem aloof, haughty or otherwise disconnected, they shouldn't take it personally. You're just being cautious, checking things out from a distance and deciding whether you really belong here. Maybe you're easily embarrassed right now. Or maybe you just got a whiff of some psychic allergen that always messes with your brain. It could be that you're a romantic with enough self-awareness to sense a pack of wolves just around a corner that you're not going to turn. You're feeling susceptible to harmful influences. It's perfectly OK to remove yourself. It's important to know your limits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
