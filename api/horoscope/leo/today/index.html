    "horoscope": "Your inner child wants to play today. You feel a steady influx of energy, a warm source within yourself that you can draw from all day long. Hard work is good. Doing something creative is even better. Express yourself in simple ways. If you spend time with other people, watch out for anything that might trigger your stubborn side. Stay loose and mellow to enjoy this day to the fullest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
