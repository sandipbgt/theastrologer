    "horoscope": "A fabulous mood has made you even more popular and likable than usual. But today shouldn't be all about you -- you're too centered and content to be self-absorbed. Besides, your friends and associates love your even temper and nimble fingers. So joyfully help them out -- you'll find that it's worth your time on many levels. Once this blessed period has passed and you need a little support yourself, they'll be there before you even ask for help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
