    "horoscope": "Today should be enjoyable, full of pleasant interactions with friends old and new. It's a great day for networking, especially in a professional arena. You're able to put others at ease as you mix business with just the right amount of pleasure. People are more willing to work with you if they sense there's common ground between you on a personal level. Play that up now. That will be your strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
