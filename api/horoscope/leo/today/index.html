    "horoscope": "Be more outgoing and give them a reason to notice you. Your friends or allies will come together whenever you beckon, which says a lot about how much they value you. You'll be a consistent and inspiring leader today, even if you're just making it up as you go. Well, that would certainly be fun, but life is too short to waste all your best chances on spur-of-the-moment plans. Start something useful while you feel this way,.
