    "horoscope": "Today is your chance to show what you can do in a professional setting, or to fulfill your responsibilities. This isn't about charming other people or making big promises. It's about, simply, putting in the effort. You possess a lot of inner strength, not to mention courage. That's a good thing, because your energy might be low now, and hard work doesn't seem like much fun. You can do it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
