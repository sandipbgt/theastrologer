    "horoscope": "Everyone you encounter today seems a little strange -- more aloof than you'd like -- and that puts you in an odd mood. The truth is, you might be coming across as more aloof than you realize, and other people are holding back when they're around you in response to your cool mood. But warmth is your thing, Leo! Loosen up, reach out and make the positive, affectionate connection you crave. You can do this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
