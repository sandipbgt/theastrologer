Just try not to lose perspective on what's really possible or appropriate. Savior fantasies are common now. But saving others isn't always possible, or even a good idea. Sometimes it's better just to focus on your own small corner of the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
