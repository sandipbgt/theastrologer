Don't blow torch everyone who doesn't agree with you. Where is this coming from? You have to admit that you're not being yourself. Somewhere along the way your mission redefined itself, and now you're starting to look like the bad guy in certain people's eyes. Change that ASAP. Keep the niceness flowing. It's what you do best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
