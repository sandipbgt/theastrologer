    "horoscope": "You'll need a physical workout today. Get outside and hit the trail or gym for a vigorous session. Otherwise, all that pent-up energy swirling around inside you might make you quite bossy. And that would just annoy your friends and colleagues, which would only make you feel worse. So try not to let any anxiety turn into full-fledged desperation. Head that off with simple measures like a long jog or a few hours of exertion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
