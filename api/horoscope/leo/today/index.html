You won't even have to check in with your guru to see what this serenity is all about. Confer with a trusted friend as you take a fresh look at where you're going. Maintain your spirit of adventure and sense of style today. Who knows where your path may lead?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
