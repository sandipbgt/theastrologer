    "horoscope": "Try not to dwell on problems today, especially relationship issues. If you let yourself become preoccupied with thoughts of lost love, longing or revenge, those thoughts could actually turn obsessive. Of course, there's a certain dark, poetic allure to yearning for love or resolution. And great, creative works of art can come of these feelings. Just don't take them too seriously! They'll pass soon. Instead of acting on them, let them evaporate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
