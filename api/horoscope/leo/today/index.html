You might boast about your accomplishments without realizing it, which puts others on the defense -- and when they call you out for arrogance, it really hurts your feelings. The best you can do today is not to take anything too personally or too seriously. Try to think of others and their feelings as well as your own, and you'll be fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
