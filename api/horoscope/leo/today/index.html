    "horoscope": "An energy boost has your ideas flowing and your mouth working overtime. You may not get a lot of work done today, because you're so busy talking to everyone you see -- even perfect strangers! You're charming and witty, and everyone loves being around you. Knock off work early, if you can. Grab a couple of friends and go out for dinner or an evening on the town. A mood like this shouldn't be wasted.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
