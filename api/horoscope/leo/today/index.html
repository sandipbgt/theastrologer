Differences of opinion can lead to some very interesting debates! And you're open to having your position reversed through the course of a stimulating dialogue. Visit someplace new, especially with a culture different from your own, to broaden your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
