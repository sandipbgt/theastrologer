    "horoscope": "Today, life feels like one big party. Even going to work is fun, because your colleagues make such an admiring audience for your wit and good humor. It's even easier than usual for you to command the room, making everyone laugh and inspiring creative ideas for all. This is the stuff you thrive on -- talking, thinking and bringing an imaginative flair to even the most mundane gatherings and tasks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
