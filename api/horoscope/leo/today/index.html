    "horoscope": "Issues of jealousy or intimacy may come up today in one of your close relationships. You might feel possessive of your sweetheart or a close friend, jealous of the time they spend away from you. If so, take a look at the root of that emotion. Deep down, you just want to be closely connected with this person you care so much about. Instead of acting on your possessive feelings, try communicating love.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
