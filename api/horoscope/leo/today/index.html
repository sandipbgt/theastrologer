    "horoscope": "Today's lunar influence has you feeling just a little bit tender. Sure, yours is the sign of the courageous lion. But you also have a soft side -- one your loved ones definitely know about! And since they know you're a softie, they also know just how to push your buttons. If a friend or family member gets under your skin, try to recognize that your current sensitivity may cause you to overreact.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
