    "horoscope": "You've reached some success, which is certainly cause for celebration. But don't crow about your victories. This will only make you look like you've got a swelled head. It's not that you don't deserve recognition for your accomplishments, but let others come to their own conclusions. After all, everyone else around you is also trying hard. Maybe you should be a bit more modest and get back to work, like the others are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
