    "horoscope": "You could feel a bit vulnerable today. Lots of people feel this way now. But you don't have to spend the day in a melancholy funk. A simple nap could do wonders for restoring your spirits. Yoga or a brief meditation could also be quite helpful, because these connect you with your spiritual self -- the part of you that exists on a higher plane, unaffected by regular, mundane emotions or concerns.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
