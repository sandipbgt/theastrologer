    "horoscope": "You're becoming aware today that some part of your life -- a relationship, perhaps, or a creative project -- is in need of completion. You'd like to be objective about it so you can wrap things up in a neat, efficient way. However, you still need recognition. Others' attention will be elsewhere today. That doesn't mean you won't gain accolades, however. It just may not happen when you'd like. Don't worry. You can practice while you wait, and then you'll be really effective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
