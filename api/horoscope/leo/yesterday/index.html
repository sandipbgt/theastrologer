Spend time with them today, and use their support in everything you do. It's a good day for group efforts, whether that means playing an online game together or launching a team project. Whatever is on your plate, let your friends and supporters know you appreciate them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
