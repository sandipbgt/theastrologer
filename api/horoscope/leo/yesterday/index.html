    "horoscope": "You're like some ancient creature from the classical world. But you're not about court intrigue and crimes of honor. That's why you should lose the politics and use your aristocrat's grace and sculptor's hands today. Be more open to cutting-edge ideas, and you could start to reshape your clunky old ways. Trust your sense of what's possible, give events a gentle push so they'll drift easily in that direction, and then put all these new visions to work creatively. Don't you want to be remembered as a genius in centuries to come?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
