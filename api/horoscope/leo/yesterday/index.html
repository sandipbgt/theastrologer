    "horoscope": "If you've experienced any tension recently in any of your friendships or other personal relationships, this is a good day to talk things out and find a resolution. You're feeling kind, affectionate and balanced, which means you're ready to take your own share of responsibility in whatever has been going on between you. It's easier than usual to listen to your friend's feelings without taking them personally, so take advantage of this gentle energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
