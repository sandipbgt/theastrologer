    "horoscope": "Your buoyant, expressive personality is a little more reserved today than usual. You've probably got a lot on your plate. You're just trying to stay focused as you juggle everything. Emphasize efficiency, but make sure your standards are reasonable. You expect a lot of yourself, and you're capable of a great deal. But there's an important difference between perfectionism and simply doing your best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
