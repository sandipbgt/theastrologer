    "horoscope": "You've always been one to follow your heart, and today it speaks up, loud and clear -- but its message isn't necessarily one you want to hear. Still, listen carefully. In the end, this inner voice will guide you toward the goals the universe wants you to achieve, and the experiences you're meant to have. Possibility will open in front of you. Let your soul guide you to your best possible path.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
