    "horoscope": "Your spirits are high today. You're in the mood to get together with people. It doesn't matter if they're friends or strangers. Group projects go especially well, as long as you do your best to cooperate with others. That means setting aside your own ego concerns for the good of the group. You enjoy the spotlight, but accept even behind-the-scenes work now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
