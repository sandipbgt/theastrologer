If you're working on a project right now, expect to make a lot of positive headway. Just do your best to avoid getting caught up in details. That can slow your progress. Sometimes being practical means knowing when to say enough is enough, and move on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
