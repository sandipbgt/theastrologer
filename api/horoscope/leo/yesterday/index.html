    "horoscope": "You look good today, and you know it -- you can feel it inside and out. You're filled with a special sense of contentment and well being, and other people are gravitating toward you, because they can sense how special you are. Today is perfect for fun gatherings where you can enjoy good conversation and the company of your friends, but it's also a great day for doing creative work, especially if it's a team effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
