    "horoscope": "Okay, it's time to take stock of what you have. Without stretching your imagination too much, assert your obvious gifts today. Play up your good looks and charm, because you've definitely got that part going on. One good strategy would be making sure that people notice you. After that, you can persuade them to do pretty much anything you want. But however you choose to reel them in, keep radiating a childlike innocence so that no one accuses you of underhanded dealing. Sure, they might suspect a little deception. Just set things up so that they won't mind being a little deceived.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
