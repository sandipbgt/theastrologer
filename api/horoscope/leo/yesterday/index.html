    "horoscope": "You're at your best today. Your energy is high, which is a good thing. The phone is ringing, emails are bouncing in one after another, and you're multitasking like a champ! You could get a lot accomplished by evening if you keep all those balls in the. Thank goodness you're an excellent performer. You get a charge out of juggling in front of a crowd. And they certainly enjoy watching you do what you do so gracefully!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
