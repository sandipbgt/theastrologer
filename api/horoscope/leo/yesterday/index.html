    "horoscope": "Your dramatic streak swells today. You feel all worked up and moody for no reason you can put your finger on. Try not to turn this stormy energy toward yourself or your partner. In moments like these, you need a lot of compassion, support and love, and creating issues in your close relationships will only make you feel worse. Look at your spouse or close friends as a safe harbor in which to anchor your ship.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
