    "horoscope": "Plug into the world and imagine the possibilities. But this time don't go into it with greed and lust. Sure, you have your needs and there will be ways to satisfy them, but by now you should start seeing past the personal benefits. You're mature and whole enough that it doesn't always have to be about you. Let generosity set the tone today, if only to prove that you still have it in you. When your gifts come from the heart, people will love you for caring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
