Just follow your instincts. If it feels important to explore a certain memory or emotion, it probably is. But if you're just pushing on a bruise to see if it still hurts, you're better off distracting yourself with something more pleasant!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
