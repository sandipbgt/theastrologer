    "horoscope": "If change is on the agenda today, or even on the horizon, you may not have a positive emotional reaction to it. You're feeling more sensitive now than usual. And the idea of something in your life shifting sets off your deepest anxieties. What will the landscape of your life look like once everything is different? That's a legitimate worry, but don't let it overwhelm you. Repeat this to yourself: Everything is going to be fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
