    "horoscope": "Your goals are prominent in your mind today. In fact, they might be weighing a bit heavily on you. It's a great day to make plans for the future, as long as you keep a realistic view of what's possible. There's no sense in pushing yourself to achieve objectives that just aren't plausible, even if you feel the pressure of someone's wishes or expectations on your shoulders.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
