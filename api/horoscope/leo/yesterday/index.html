    "horoscope": "You've got a lot going for you today, including resources you don't mention to anyone else. Your patience is admirable, and your sense of perfection is impeccable. A day of hard labor doesn't scare you. There's something very satisfying about using your muscles and sweating. Results happen at many speeds on many levels now. Take pride in that. Your accomplishments are broad-based and far-reaching, just as they should be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
