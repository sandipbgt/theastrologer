Thoughts of 'coulda, woulda, shoulda' may dominate your mind. You might dwell on the idea that you should have gotten more schooling, or ponder some mistake you made in your work that cost you time and effort. But let yourself off the hook. It's all a learning curve.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
