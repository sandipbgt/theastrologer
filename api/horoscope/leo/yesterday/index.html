Regardless of whether things are blissful or rough between you, they're intense, and it's hard for you to take things lightly now. This is one of those days when you might experience a wonderfully passionate connection with your sweetheart, or you might go through emotional torture -- only to realize, later, that things weren't nearly as bad as you thought.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
