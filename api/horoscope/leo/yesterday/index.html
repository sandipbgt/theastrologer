    "horoscope": "If there's anyone who can disarm others with charm and sparkling wit, it's you. Today you're warm and talkative, eager to connect with the people you care about most. You may have to do more than that, though. Someone may call on you to mediate a sticky situation. You're the perfect person for the job, after all. People could use a dose of your warmth, not to mention your fair-minded perspective. So put that friendly vibe to good use.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
