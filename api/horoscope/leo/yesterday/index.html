    "horoscope": "Your natural warmth and enthusiasm are inspiring. If you're heading up a team today, you can keep everyone working hard and smiling while they're at it. But some temperance is in order as well. It's great to be so exuberant, but make sure you don't peak too early. Focus on maintaining a steady pace. Practice your drills, even if you think you've got them down cold. Save your real fireworks for later, when things build into something truly exciting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
