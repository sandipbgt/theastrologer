Be strong if you have to, but don't push your agenda too aggressively. In fact, it would be much smarter to forget about winning or losing and seek a compromise instead. Ask the other person what they need to feel comfortable, and listen carefully when they answer. You can probably live with their terms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
