    "horoscope": "You're famous for your pride, as well as your lionhearted courage. But today, you're feeling unusually sensitive. Careless words and actions get right under your skin. It's unlikely that anyone is trying to hurt your feelings, but it certainly feels as if they aren't being thoughtful enough. Try to remember that any remarks that you find hurtful were probably delivered with the best of intentions. Summon that inner strength,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
