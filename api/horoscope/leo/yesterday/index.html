    "horoscope": "Sometimes you're saved by the bell, but this time it could be distracting. That doesn't matter. Heed the call. Cater to the crybabies. Start accommodating the people whose needs are louder than your own. Sure, it could get pretty noisy around here, but you don't have to let that wave of sound drown out your song of self-certainty. Even if you're not somebody who lives to serve, you can do it well enough when you have to. Today might even qualify you for cheerful sainthood. But you'll probably take a more tangible payoff than being worshipped. You're not that picky.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
