    "horoscope": "Your intuitions are strong today, but your mood may be iffy. You're usually so confident, but now you feel somehow vulnerable, though not for any particular reason that you can pinpoint. At times like this, it's best to take it easy rather than pushing yourself. Spend the day quietly at home, if you can. At work, complete your tasks quietly on your own, and don't stress if you proceed slowly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
