    "horoscope": "At a party or on a date today, you're the center of the crowd. People find your ideas incredibly interesting. Or maybe you just deliver them in such a vibrant, engaging way! Business meetings go well, too. You're thinking on your feet, with a high level of creativity. It's a great day for doing imaginative work or bringing a team together. You can motivate people to unite under a common banner.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
