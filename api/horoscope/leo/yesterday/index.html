    "horoscope": "A sense of daring makes you impulsive today -- and this is actually a benefit to your work and other pursuits. You're bold enough to make something happen, even if you're just winging it as you go! Other people probably can't tell you're going on impulse. You're so vibrantly confident, you make even a tough, tricky undertaking look easy. That's just one of your many talents,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
