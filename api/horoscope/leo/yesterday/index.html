    "horoscope": "Welcome to a bright, sunny day -- no matter the weather outside. You're curious and engaged with the world around you. You get a lot out of interacting with other people now, so don't spend too much time alone if you don't have to. And if you are on your own, find ways to reach out by phone, text or email. Staying connected is important. Doing so could lead to a great opportunity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
