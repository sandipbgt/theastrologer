    "horoscope": "You're feeling sentimental today. Your love for your friends and family is strong, and you're expressing it with hugs, smiles and murmurs of affection. You might also cook for your loved ones, since food is such a primal and primary source of nurturing. If you don't feel you're getting back the love you're giving out, try not to take it personally. Someone else may not be in such a generous, connected mood as you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
