    "horoscope": "Your manner is imperial, but your aspirations are noble. You're like functioning royalty -- you have the title and the power, but you also deliver. Look at the nature of these deliveries, though. Don't just go dumping onto other people's heads. Be sensitive to their needs today. Once you get the picture, start using all those royal gifts to invent solutions and organize your program around what's good for them. That make a lot more sense than  sticking with what's easy for you. They'll love you for it, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
