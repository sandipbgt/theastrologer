    "horoscope": "You're a passionately opinionated person. Today, you may find yourself arguing with someone over the best way to pursue a project or a cause. Instead of getting upset and digging your heels in, try to listen to the other side. It's likely that everyone involved wants what's best for the group. Finding common ground is important now. Working together is so much more effective than stubbornly going it alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
