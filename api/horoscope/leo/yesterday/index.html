    "horoscope": "Your charm is on high today. Among friends or coworkers, you're clever and good-humored, and everyone's attention is trained on you. It's a great day for proposing new ideas that you've been worried wouldn't go over well. Other people's minds are more open now than usual, so they'll be more willing to listen to your creative perspective. And with your personal magnetism, it shouldn't be hard to convince them to give it a try.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
