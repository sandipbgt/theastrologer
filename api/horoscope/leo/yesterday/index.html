    "horoscope": "You'll shine as a front runner in any type of competition today. This goes for formal competitions, such as races, contests and vying for a professional or educational placement. But it also goes for informal competitions that are just for fun. Your strength and energy make you a formidable competitor. And you can think on your feet. Your quick, spontaneous and agile moves keep the other side guessing!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
