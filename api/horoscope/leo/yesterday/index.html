Don't let obligations or others' expectations limit you from exploring it! The current influence is the kind that urges you to teach yourself something new. Exploratory methods work best, because they exercise your mind and remind you that you're a lifelong learner. You're finding your path, and it's truly inspiring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
