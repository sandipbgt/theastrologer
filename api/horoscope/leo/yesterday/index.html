    "horoscope": "Solving problems couldn't be easier for you now. At work and in relationships, it's almost as if you have a supernatural gift of foresight -- your instincts let you avoid pitfalls and potholes before they happen. It's safe to say that soon, someone will be thanking you profusely. If and when this happens, accept their gratitude with humility. Of course, it doesn't hurt that you did so with such dashing panache and grace. But then, that's just your style.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
