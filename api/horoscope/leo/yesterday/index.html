    "horoscope": "Today, performance becomes a kind of art. You could be on either end of this equation. You're dramatic by nature, and it's even easier than usual to sway people with your charisma. But you're also a true romantic, so someone's sweet gestures could sweep you off your feet. Make sure every gesture or offer you make is genuine and heartfelt. And take a wait-and-see attitude with anyone who's trying to win your affection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
