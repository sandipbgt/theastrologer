    "horoscope": "This will be an energetic day. You'll be responding to whatever happens and making some on-the-spot decisions. Yes, it feels good to be in charge, but don't distract yourself too much by constantly checking out your moves in the mirror. Your view has to be more of a wide-angle shot when you're standing on the verge of some great discovery. It's just around the corner, too. What happens now could be anybody's guess, although what happened earlier will determine how you'll handle this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
