    "horoscope": "Today could bring some type of emotional struggle. People know you as vibrant and courageous, but beneath that confident exterior, you have real vulnerability. That could come up under the current cosmic influence, especially in regards to an intimate relationship. Whatever you're feeling, feel it -- but try not to give it more weight than it deserves. Even dark emotions will pass quickly, and the sunshine will return.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
