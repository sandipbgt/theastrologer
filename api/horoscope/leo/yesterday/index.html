If you're holding on -- a little bit desperately -- to some valued, important part of your life, take another look. Whatever it is that you're trying so hard to retain, the truth is, anything that changes now is meant to change. Don't let an outdated worldview dominate your future. Seek new horizons.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
