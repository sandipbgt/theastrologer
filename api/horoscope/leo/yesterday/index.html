    "horoscope": "After all your hard work of the past couple of days, you're happy to kick back today and enjoy yourself. Don't spend the day alone if you don't have to. Find a group of friends, even if you have to meet up with them virtually instead of in person, and trade laughter and stories. A meeting of the minds boosts your creativity, not to mention your morale, and that's always a good feeling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
