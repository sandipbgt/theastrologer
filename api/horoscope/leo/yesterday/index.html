Or, simply look through books of paintings or photographs for inspiration. Sometimes you simply need to remind yourself that the world is full of aesthetic appeal. Other times, you want to gain inspiration from other artists' works, so you can create your own!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
