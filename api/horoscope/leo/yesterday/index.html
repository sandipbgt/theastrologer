    "horoscope": "A silly, restless mood overtakes you. It's fun to goof off, but your boss may not have a sense of humor about it. Of course, if you're expecting a better offer, you probably don't care how you come across to higher-ups, and you can do what you like. But if you care about your work and would prefer to maintain positive connections with your colleagues, you'd better shape up soon. Show them you can buckle down and get serious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
