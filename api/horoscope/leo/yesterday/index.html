It's also a great day to connect with someone you adore, but don't take it personally if they don't seem as head-over-heels about you as you feel about them! They're probably feeling the connection just as strongly; they just aren't expressing it with your dramatic, demonstrative flair.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
