    "horoscope": "You're on target and in the groove. Your body syncs up to the dominant rhythm, and your schedule coordinates easily with the universe. It's a little unconscious and a little by choice. You want to play, you need to work, and you can wrap it all in the same package. Maybe that explains why you'll be ridiculously cheerful today. But keep your eyes on the prize, too. There's a kind of unspoken beauty in going for what you want. Call it poetic justice, managed karma or just an instinctive knack for being in the right place at the right time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
