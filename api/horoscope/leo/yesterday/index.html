    "horoscope": "Your high spirits are contagious. You're able to entertain yourself and everyone else today, without even trying. This isn't just about feeling good, either. You're creating great memories, right here and now, especially if you put a little thought and effort into it. If at all possible, get out of your normal surroundings for a day, or even just an afternoon. Travel someplace different and stimulating. Bring a friend and your camera, so you can document the ride.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
