    "horoscope": "Sentimentality comes with a hefty price tag today. Is that why you're so grumpy? If so, the answer's easy -- if you can't really afford it, just don't go there. Don't let yourself get bogged down in melancholy or nostalgia. Stay on the sunny side of the street and focus on the parts of your life that are positive and strong. Get some exercise with a friend, or play with a child or pet. You'll feel better in no time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
