    "horoscope": "You're feeling centered and on-task. Your rational ways are inspiring to everyone around you. You can lead your colleagues toward a satisfying conclusion to a project. You can help friends resolve an issue you've been having. Be patient if everyone stands around and watches you in motion. It's possible someone will offer to help. If they don't, it's because they're in awe of your practical, straightforward approach. In fact, don't worry what everyone else is doing or thinking. Just do your thing, and do it well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
