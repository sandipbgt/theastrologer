    "horoscope": "Your emotions are all stirred up today. You might even feel melancholy or vulnerable, especially if you sense that someone you're close with isn't as available as you'd like. Feelings of loneliness or rejection can be painful, but they actually offer you a good learning opportunity. You're stronger than you think. Yours is the sign of the courageous lion, after all!
