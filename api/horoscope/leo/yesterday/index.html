    "horoscope": "When a friend comes to you with a problem or a situation develops at work, you're able to listen and offer advice without getting caught up in the drama, and that's a good thing. Being levelheaded while reserving emotional judgment is a real skill -- it allows you to be both practical and objective, which is the perfect mindset for getting things done. If anyone has an issue with your no nonsense outlook, don't worry about it. Proof will come soon,, and everyone will see you were on the right track.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
