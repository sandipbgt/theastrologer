    "horoscope": "You're overeating today, spending too much money, or wavering between sustained effort and total, irresponsible relaxation. You may not realize it, but you're probably feeling insecure about something -- your job or income, maybe, or the future in general. Napping, eating lots of sweets or shopping on credit is just an attempt to fill that void, but you'll feel better if you focus on your worries and then think up a practical solution.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
