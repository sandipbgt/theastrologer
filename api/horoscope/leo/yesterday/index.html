You're certainly more tuned in to the current energy than some people are. Tap into your playful side. Be youthful and carefree. Set an example for all the fuddy-duddies and sticks-in-the-mud who don't know how to let loose and lighten up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
