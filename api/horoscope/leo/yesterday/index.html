    "horoscope": "Stay sensible in all you do today. Don't let your emotions get the best of you. Staying calm and focused is best. This may mean setting your ego or your needs aside in order to place something else first -- doing a good job at work, for example, or doing what's best for your family. Take others' feedback seriously rather than taking it personally. That will help you hone your approach.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
