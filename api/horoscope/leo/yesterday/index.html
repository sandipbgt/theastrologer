    "horoscope": "If you're trying to appeal to a group today, be careful in how you address them. A dogmatic attitude won't go over well. But you have the power to really inspire people, so let that shine through. Convince them that you have their interests in mind, and they'll be far more willing to work with you. A self-serving agenda, on the other hand, is likely to push them away.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
