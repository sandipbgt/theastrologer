For today, just keep plugging away, quietly and steadily, at whatever you're working on. Deep down, you know that you still need a bit more proof that this is the real thing. Listen to that instinct and act on it. Research can bring you inspiration; it might even show you a direction you hadn't thought of before.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
