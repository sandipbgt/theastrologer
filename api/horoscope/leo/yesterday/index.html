    "horoscope": "Today you're highly energetic -- but that's just the cherry on top of the cake. Your true gift now is the fact that your leadership qualities are shining. All eyes turn your way when you walk into a room. Taking command of a project or team is easy, because you're so charismatic. You have a way of making people want to give their best effort. Put that gift to use! Create something memorable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
