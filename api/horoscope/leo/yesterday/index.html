Make sure that any move you make is for a good reason -- and ego-stroking doesn't count! Right now you can create things or launch projects with utmost passion, so you should really direct that toward something worthwhile -- a long-term goal you'll still relate to in a week's or month's time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
