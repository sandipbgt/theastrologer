    "horoscope": "Somewhere along the line, your famous confidence morphed into anxiety, and now you're feeling neglected, unappreciated and overlooked. Remember, though, everything is a matter of perception. Maybe your friends are simply too busy to call today -- hey, it happens. Maybe that prospective client is still considering your proposal, and they 'll call you back tomorrow. Insisting on having your needs met first isn't the way to endear yourself to others. Have a heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
