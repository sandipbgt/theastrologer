    "horoscope": "Your values are impeccable, but the truth is, you're a little too smug about being old school. In fact, the very people you're trying to impress -- your boss, or a new client? -- are likely to be turned off by your attitude, even if they like your principles and ethics. Any hint of elitism on your part could close doors today, so watch your step. Try sharing your experiences instead of hoarding them -- make others feel as if you're including them instead of shutting them out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
