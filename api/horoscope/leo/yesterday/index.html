    "horoscope": "Your usual, energetic demeanor is toned down under today's cosmic influence. Like many people, you probably have a lot to do. Even if you have a wide-open agenda, a nervous feeling could still hang over you, as if you're pressed for time. Stay busy, if you want to. But if you're just creating the illusion of having things to do and places to be, go ahead and take a break.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
