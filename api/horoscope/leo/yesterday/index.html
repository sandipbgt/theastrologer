    "horoscope": "There's a fun, party-like atmosphere infusing the air today. You're interested in everyone you meet. The more different they are from you, the better you like it. Differences of opinion can lead to some very interesting debates! And you're open to having your position reversed through the course of a stimulating dialogue. Visit someplace new, especially with a culture different from your own, to broaden your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
