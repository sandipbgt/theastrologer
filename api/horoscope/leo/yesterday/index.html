    "horoscope": "You'll sparkle today. You'll be strange and theatrical, a spot of living color flitting through a bleak, flat world. You'll radiate eternal hope. Be happy to carry good news even if it doesn't apply to you. Be bigger than your needs, which should be easy if you don't need much. You can get by on other people's smiles. To ask for more would be to steal a little of their joy, and they need it more than you do. Grow through giving. It's a simple concept that makes a lot of sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
