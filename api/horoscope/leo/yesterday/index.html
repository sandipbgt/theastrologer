    "horoscope": "Spend time with family today, or your closest friends -- you know, those people who might as well be family. You aren't in the mood for the company of strangers. In fact, having to chat up someone you don't know could make you nervous, despite your natural warmth and charm. So stick to familiar people and places as much as possible today. Soon, you'll feel outgoing again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
