A heart-to-heart talk with your partner could get heated, but sometimes it's good to clear the, especially if there's a certain issue you've been worrying about. And if this is a romantic partner with whom you're clearing the, kissing and making up is worth any momentary tension!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
