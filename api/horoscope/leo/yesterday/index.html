    "horoscope": "Your fan club is making noise -- clamoring, really, something about individual rights and independence. If their words are falling on deaf ears, it's time for you time to listen up. There's no doubt that you're special, but everyone is special in their own way. Even your faithful followers like to be acknowledged and to have their good points noticed. The more you do this, the more they'll look up to you. Oh, and the clamoring will stop.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
