    "horoscope": "Life doesn't seem as sweet and sparkly today as it normally does. Maybe things really are more difficult now than usual. Maybe you simply have a cynical, superficial view. Do your trusted friends agree that things were better in the past? Either way, don't be bitter. Try to learn something instead: There's a lesson here about being adaptable and working with what you've got rather than lamenting about what you think you lost. Soon you'll be feeling a lot more confident.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
