    "horoscope": "You want what you want when you want it, and you're not ready to compromise. But that could be hard for your friends, partners or colleagues. Your attitude could annoy them or hurt their feelings. Besides, you're likely to find that out-and-out rebellion is futile, so you might as well save yourself the trouble. It's wonderful to be passionate about your beliefs, needs or cause, but remember that others have opinions, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
