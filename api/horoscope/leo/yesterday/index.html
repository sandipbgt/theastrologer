Invite a foreign element into your daily experience by putting up some fun decorations, eating some international cuisine or wearing a fun costume that transports you to another place. It doesn't take much to turn the driest of events into something festive. Many people are ready to laugh and play, and you're there to lead the way,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
