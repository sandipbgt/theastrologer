    "horoscope": "OK, OK, you're sorry already. You said so, and that's that. Well, maybe not. Maybe you ought to be showing how much you mean it. Making up will be critical now, and it'll require a lot more heart than just another round of polite apologies. Spend the day mending fences and building better mousetraps. Fly your true colors and see how many people stop to watch them snapping in the sunshine and wind. Shared energy is sure to beat any solo effort, which of course is why you want to be attracting all this attention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
