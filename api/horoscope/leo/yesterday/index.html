    "horoscope": "If you want to show off, don't be fussy about it. You're free to put on a show, but people don't have to pay attention if they don't feel like it. Remember, most people have short attention spans, so they tend to lose interest quickly -- even in the best, most spectacular of acts. If this happens to you, don't get worked up about it. Just move on and start dreaming up your next big show.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
