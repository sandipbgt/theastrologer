    "horoscope": "Your ideas are dynamic today. You're thinking on all cylinders, and you bring color to the conversation, not to mention far-reaching wisdom. This gives you a lot of power in group situations, because everyone listens when you speak. If you have an agenda, you can push it far now. If not, brainstorm with others and develop one. It's important to use these windows of heightened creativity when they pop up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
