    "horoscope": "There's an oddly unemotional tone to your relationships today, as if the ardent emotional core of life has cooled. This doesn't sit well with you, since you're a naturally passionate, expressive person. If someone close to you suddenly seems aloof, you might respond with intense feeling. But heated displays won't go over well; now more than ever, people are uncomfortable with conflict. The good news is, any strangeness will blow over soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
