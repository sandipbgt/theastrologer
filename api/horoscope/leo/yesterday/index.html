    "horoscope": "You're a big fish in a small pond, a tempest in a teapot, or a self-fulfilling celebrity. That's a good thing, right? You're dashing, autonomous, and free to go -- well, probably nowhere, by the looks of it. This could be an inconclusive day. You'll impress people who ultimately won't matter, build sandcastles that the next high tide will wash away, and generally spin your wheels. Try not to waste all your talent and charm here. Save it for something important in case you find a way out. Oh, and start looking for that escape route now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
