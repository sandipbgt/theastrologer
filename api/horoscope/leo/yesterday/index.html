But if you merge those plans with someone else's, you'll reach even greater results. In general, your best bet now is to be part of a crowd. Joining a movement that's bigger than just yourself and your own mundane concerns makes you feel swept up in something important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
