    "horoscope": "A trip to the mall today could turn into an all-out shopping spree, even if you can't afford it. It's the same with food, too. If you make or buy a batch of treats, be sure to share them! Your urge to indulge is high, which can throw self-control right out the window. Don't worry about it right now. Just enjoy yourself in this moment. The time for discipline will soon return.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
