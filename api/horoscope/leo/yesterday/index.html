    "horoscope": "Forget the begging and wheedling. You won't need that kid stuff any more. Your arguments are a lot more powerful than usual, and your methods are more subtle than anyone expects. Gently but irresistibly sway others to believe in your ideals. You'll be incredibly convincing today, thanks to the solid proofs you'll offer them, and to your future-forward attitude that could make a believer out of anyone. Just by telling the truth as you see it, you can build the biggest and best team yet. These people will take what you give them and run with it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
