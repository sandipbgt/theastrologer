    "horoscope": "Your bonds with friends and family take on extra meaning today. Now it feels especially important to reach out and connect. Call up a longtime friend, or visit an elderly relative. Talk and laugh over old, dear memories. These might even be bittersweet, but it still feels good to recall them. They're part of the continuity of your life. And you'd never want to forget where you've been, or the person you used to be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
