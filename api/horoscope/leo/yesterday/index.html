While attending to these tasks may not seem like the most fun or exciting way to spend your day, there is an undeniable sense of satisfaction that comes from a job well done. At the end of the day, you can look back at all you accomplished and know you did well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
