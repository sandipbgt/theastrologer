    "horoscope": "Today you're expressing yourself with great feeling and intensity. You'll certainly get your point across -- you're too passionate not to! But do be aware that other people are feeling their emotions quite intensely, too. That colors their perceptions, which means they might not interpret your words exactly as you intended them. Put more bluntly, don't be surprised if someone takes offense when none was intended. You may have to do damage control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
