    "horoscope": "An influx of idealistic energy has your head in the clouds today. Whether your mind is on personal matters or professional ones, you're envisioning them in the rosiest of terms. This can be positive, if it brings your highest ideals and fondest hopes into focus. Envisioning your future helps you create it, after all. Trouble only comes if someone's harsh comment bursts your pretty bubble and punctures your vulnerability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
