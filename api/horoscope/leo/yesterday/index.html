    "horoscope": "Today, a strong desire kicks in to improve the world around you. Creating positive change is truly a valiant pursuit -- even if you're in it for the glory. Your natural energy and creativity enhance any cause, and if you get to bask in accolades after your hard work, so much the better! Just don't get caught up in thinking that your work was in vain if no one pats you on the back for it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
