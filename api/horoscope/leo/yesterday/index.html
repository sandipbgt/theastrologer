You know they'll just fall out of fashion sooner or later, and probably sooner -- and wouldn't you rather buy security than trouble? Not to mention enjoying the fruits of your hard labors for more than just a few months. Listen to your inner voice when it tells you to put that expensive bauble down.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
