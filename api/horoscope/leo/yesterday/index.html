    "horoscope": "Emotions swamp you today. You're always devoted to the people you love, but now that feeling swells tenfold. Your family seems especially dear to you, and being at home has never felt more comfortable or secure. Even if you have to work, spend some time on the couch or in the kitchen, or call an old, dear friend and catch up on what's been happening in both your lives.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
