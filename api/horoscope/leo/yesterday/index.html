    "horoscope": "You're a star in your own mind. Today is your chance to show off the charisma that sets you apart from the rest. Just be conscious of how you're coming across to other people.

Humor and humility go a long way toward staying right where you belong: Front and center in people's adoration!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
