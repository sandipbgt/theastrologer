    "horoscope": "If you're petulant and self-aggrandizing today, you might be defending a fragile ego. Other people recognize this, too. Don't think you're fooling anyone by being prickly or vain. Wouldn't it feel better just to break down and admit you're vulnerable? Well, if you can't do that, at least you can earn your praise by working hard. Apply yourself to a project or relationship, and create something positive. That should lift you right out of this bad mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
