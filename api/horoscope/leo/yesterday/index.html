Logically, you might realize these things don't really mean that much in the grand scheme of things. But in the moment, you want them. Maybe it will help to shift your focus onto other ways of impressing people, such as with your honesty and trustworthiness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
