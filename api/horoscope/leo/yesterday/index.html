    "horoscope": "Get out of the house or office today. You're too lighthearted and energetic to stay in! It's fun to laugh, chat or even flirt a little bit. You feel very awake and alert. Using your mind is a pleasure, so work it out as you'd work your muscles. Puzzles and complex concepts present an enjoyable challenge, and working through them helps you communicate your own ideas with greater eloquence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
