If you just want to blow off a little steam, go for a run, or punch out a few rounds on the heavy bag at the gym. With friends and work mates, try stating your needs in a calm, direct way. That approach is guaranteed to have better results than the other, more manipulative one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
