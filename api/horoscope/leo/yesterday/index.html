You're really noticing this shift, since you're usually all about warmth, generosity and giving. But there's a time and a place for everything, and right now, it's time for prudent living. Get on board,. You'll feel better once you've handled these things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
