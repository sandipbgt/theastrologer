    "horoscope": "High spirits put you in a great mood today. So you're a little bit reckless. So what? Taking chances can lead to good things now. Maybe that's just the magic of self-confidence! You have no trouble thinking on your feet, even under pressure. It's a great day to impress someone, such as your employer or another VIP. They'll surely take note of how well you perform, even when you're completely unrehearsed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
