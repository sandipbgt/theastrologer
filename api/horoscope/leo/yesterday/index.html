    "horoscope": "It's a great day to be social, or better yet, to work with a group toward an important goal. There's a lot of power in team efforts. The only trick is meshing your own ideas with others'. It's hard to keep your ego out of the equation, because feeling inspired makes you more invested in pushing your own agenda. Keep in mind that your main agenda is what's best for the group.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
