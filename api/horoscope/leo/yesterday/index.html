    "horoscope": "Today, you feel a deep urge to help others in some way. This compassion may extend itself toward a friend or stranger in need, a stray animal, a charitable organization or anyone else you see that's in need of help that you can provide. Just make sure you're doing this for the right reasons. Selfless urges should come not from a desire for recognition, but from genuinely wanting to make someone's load a little lighter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
