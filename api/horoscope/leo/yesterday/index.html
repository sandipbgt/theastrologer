    "horoscope": "You're a tenacious friend and a doting loved one. Are these bad things? Absolutely not! Celebrate your belonging by throwing a dinner party or hosting movie night for the people you love best. The emphasis should be on fun, comfort, and intimacy. In a few days, you can go out and have a real life. For now, your focus should be on building up your interior world -- the world of family, emotions, and tending to your urge for security.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
