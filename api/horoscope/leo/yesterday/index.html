But if they don't seem quite as keen on closeness, maybe you're being a little demanding of their time. Possessive feelings are common today, and no one likes feeling smothered. It may be a good idea to keep the old saying in mind -- 'If you love someone, set them free.' People adore you,. They'll be back in no time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
