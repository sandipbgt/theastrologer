You're selfless right now; you have such a feeling of devotion that you'd do anything for the people you love. Grand gestures aren't enough! And yet, you don't have to do anything showy to prove your feelings. Just being there for someone is more than enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
