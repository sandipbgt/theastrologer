It draws all eyes your way, and if there's anything you're trying to accomplish, now would be a great time to make it happen. Just be concise when you make your pitch. You want to send people away feeling entertained and educated rather than making them feel as if you've just taken advantage of them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
