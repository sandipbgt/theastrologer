    "horoscope": "Your showy, dramatic side is toned down today. Now it seems more important to play up your more traditional, reliable qualities. Let a friend know you're there for them. If you work with clients, they'll be glad to know you're dependable, too. You also take great comfort now in routine, so stick to yours. Wake up and go to bed at regular hours. And avoid junk food! Eating right keeps you centered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
