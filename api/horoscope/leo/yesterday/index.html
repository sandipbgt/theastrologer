In any crisis that may arise today, you're sure to be a first responder. The same goes for celebrations, because you're just as up for fun as you are for valiant rescues. It's no wonder other people see you as a hero. You can play to the crowd, at least a little. You deserve to strut your stuff.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
