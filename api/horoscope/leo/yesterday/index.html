    "horoscope": "Your artistic flair is highlighted today. Your creativity blends effortlessly with your social abilities. You're like a work of art in motion -- bright, compelling and attractive to everyone! This is a great opportunity, but a brief one, so take advantage of it. You can mix with any social group now, or gain the support of any professional associate. And any project is better if it's pursued as a group effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
