Or maybe it's the rest of the world that seems reserved and unwilling to connect. Either way, use this time to make some headway on the mental plane. Your thought processes are incredibly keen. You're thinking like a scientist. Put these skills to good use.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
