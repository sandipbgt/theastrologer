    "horoscope": "It's a great day to pursue something you've been coveting for some time. This might be anything from a job promotion to a new outfit to someone cute and special. Your energy is high and you're feeling courageous, but there's more to it than that. Your natural charisma is really shining now. You're drawing good things your way, simply because you believe you deserve them. It's your very own law of attraction!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
