    "horoscope": "Temptation will be overwhelming today. Will you go against your better judgment? Will you stand firm and just say no? Be polite and stand on ceremony no matter what. Use flowery language and make courteous gestures, even if they are just a smoke screen for what you end up doing in private. Someone's future or reputation is at stake, and the slightest whisper of a scandal could bring it all crashing down. Don't think you're immune, either. There's no way to guess what you might end up regretting. A missed opportunity would probably hurt less.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
