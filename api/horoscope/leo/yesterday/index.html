And now that you've established this legend in your own mind, don't be too condescending toward others. Don't hold them to standards they'll never reach, or expect them to make payments they can't afford. Getting them to worship or fear you won't make you any new friends today. On the other hand, taking yourself a lot less seriously could open new doors.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
