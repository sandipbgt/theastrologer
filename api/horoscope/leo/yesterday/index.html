    "horoscope": "You're a passionate person by nature, and today your inneris blazing! Whether that's a good thing or a challenging one is up to you. After all, there are some wonderful expressions of passion -- doing creative work, for example, or connecting with your sweetheart. But anger is another form of passion. Avoid displays of temper now.
