Maybe you're just doing this for your own amusement, but when you're busy having fun, your talents and charms will emerge for all to see. Next thing you know, you'll be the center of attention, but in a good way. After all, why shouldn't you be getting the royal treatment? Who deserves it more than someone like you, who'd never dream of taking unfair advantage? Don't waste another day denying what could be yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
