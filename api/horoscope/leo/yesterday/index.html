    "horoscope": "Creativity abounds today. You may feel as if your ideas are electric, but you could just as easily feel pressured to push toward greater heights of originality, to prove how courageous your thinking can be. Imaginative ideas are a wonderful thing if they arise honestly. But falling short of sheer genius could make you feel inadequate. Have confidence that you're brilliant in moments. That's the most anyone could hope.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
