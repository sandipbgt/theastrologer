Even just swaying in your living room to the throbbing beat of world music is fun -- anything that gets you moving. And having kids around only enhances the mood. Any type of spontaneous laughter or game is a great idea today. Just have a good time. This is where you shine,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
