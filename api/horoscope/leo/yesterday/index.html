    "horoscope": "You're a passionate person already, but today, your passions are aroused -- and this could be good or bad, depending on many factors. If you feel turned on, tuned in and in love with life, then that's wonderful. Connect with your friends or sweetheart and have a great day! But if difficult feelings like jealousy or anger intrude, that's when it's time to rein yourself in. Try to stay both calm and objective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
