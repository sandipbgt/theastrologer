It's fine to unleash your inner comedian among a group of friends, or to dress for success when attending an important function. Being on display is in your nature, after all. You enjoy the rush that comes from all eyes focusing on you. Just don't get sucked into thinking you have to perform. Being yourself is dazzling enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
