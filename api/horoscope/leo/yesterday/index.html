Your family is incredibly important to you, whether that's your family of origin or of choice. And home can be a wonderful retreat when life gets tough. Even if things are going smoothly, it's a great day to cook dinner at home and enjoy it with someone you care about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
