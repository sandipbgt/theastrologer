    "horoscope": "Today you're deeply in touch with your feelings, in all their irrational glory. Spending time with a friend might bring tears of joy to your eyes -- or tears of anger. Your feelings can go either way. You're extra sensitive now. If you feel insulted or ignored, you won't sit quietly by! It's good to talk out your feelings, but remember, there are at least two sides to every situation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
