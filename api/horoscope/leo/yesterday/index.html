    "horoscope": "Getting work or errands accomplished today takes focus. But focusing on the task at hand feels good. You have a bit of a perfectionist streak, after all. It comes from wanting others to admire your intelligence and talent. Today is a great day to apply yourself to a project and really put your all into it. People are sure to notice and appreciate your careful, thorough efforts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
