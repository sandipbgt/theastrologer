You love being the bright, dynamic center of any group, and you have lots of creative ideas. But right now, set all that aside. Make an effort to blend in with the group. Ask other people for their input, and stay open to unexpected ideas and unfamiliar approaches.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
