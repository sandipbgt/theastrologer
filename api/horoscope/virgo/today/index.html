    "horoscope": "You're feeling more alert than usual today, and you may be more goal-oriented, too. An energy boost makes it easier to do your work. The only problem is, you might find yourself starting several different projects and not really finishing any of them. Depending on your personality, this might drive you to distraction! Try tackling tasks that have clear steps and conclusions, so you'll be more likely to complete them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
