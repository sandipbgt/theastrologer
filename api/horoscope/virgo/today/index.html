    "horoscope": "Well, aren't you a discriminating consumer? You know what you like, where to get it, and how much of it to use. Because, after all, this stuff isn't cheap, and it might be hard to come by. For a few days you should be taking an active interest in the supply chain. Keep those goods and services flowing whether you're buying, selling or producing them. Do your part to keep everyone else confident in the system, since it's the best way to guarantee that things will keep running smoothly. It's citizenship in action. Congratulations for learning the lesson.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
