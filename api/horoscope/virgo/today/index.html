    "horoscope": "You rarely feel better than when you're helping others. Today, you have a good opportunity to help someone, but you'll go beyond simply identifying their need and fulfilling it. Your compassion is high today, and it's easy to empathize with others. You truly feel their pain. And helping them through a tough spot soothes you at a deeply emotional level. Don't be surprised if you learn something about your own inner self today!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
