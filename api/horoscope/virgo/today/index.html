    "horoscope": "Human nature is fascinating today. It's a great time to explore your own psyche through a visit to a therapist, or perhaps reading about psychology or astrology. Talking with a friend about their problems is also instructive, and quite engrossing. Alternatively, it's a good time to get absorbed in reading or research. Go deeply into a subject that interests you. You'll learn a great deal and discover unexpected parts of yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
