    "horoscope": "If you spent yesterday having a good time, turn your focus today toward your responsibilities at home or in your relationships. Balance is especially important now, and it's always good to cover all your bases. A personal connection may need some attention; if so, talk things over and see if you can reach an agreement together. This should be easy, as long as you let the other person know how much you care.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
