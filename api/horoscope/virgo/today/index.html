This is actually a very natural way for you to express yourself, since you're inclined to help others from behind the scenes. Don't forget to check what people before you have done already, so you don't reinvent the wheel. That would be a waste of your precious time and valuable energy!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
