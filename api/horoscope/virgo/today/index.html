    "horoscope": "Instead of telling others today all about how they can change their lives for the better, show them you care simply by being a compassionate listener. Sometimes people don't need your advice, even if it's solid and knowledgeable. Sometimes, they just want a strong shoulder and a caring ear. You can do this for them now, because your feeling side is stirred up. Sometimes, emotional sensitivity is a good thing!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
