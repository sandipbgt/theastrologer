Be careful as you're running errands, navigating traffic, returning phone calls and snacking on a protein bar all at once -- sometimes, multitasking can actually be dangerous! It doesn't matter how high your energy might be or how much pressure you're putting on yourself to perform to an impossible standard. Give yourself a break,! Adopt the mantra, 'One thing at a time.'(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
