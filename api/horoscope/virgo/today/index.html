    "horoscope": "Yes, you're focused on your goals and motivated enough to achieve them on your own, but you should still be receptive to others' ideas. Work together with your friends or work-mates to get something important accomplished. Delegate tasks to people who can handle them, and then apply your considerable energy and keen wits to your end of things. Also, share your own storehouse of wisdom with others today. Everyone benefits from a wide pool of knowledge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
