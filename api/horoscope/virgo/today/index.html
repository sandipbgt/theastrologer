So why not toss out conventional means and embrace the karmic today? It certainly lends a bigger picture. This won't give you control, but it does increase your understanding. Try those more traditional methods again later, after your world view has been restored.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
