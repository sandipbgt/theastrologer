Let your iron cool off for a couple of days, and limit yourself to thinking and doing only what comes easily. You deserve a break,, and your whole life will benefit from your refreshed perspective. In a few days, you can jump back into the fray and really get something accomplished.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
