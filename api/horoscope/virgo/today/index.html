    "horoscope": "You're all about self-improvement, so turn that sharp eye of yours toward your partnerships today. This doesn't mean you should be critical of your spouse or business partner. In fact, you should go out of your way to speak kindly and compassionately to them, because they truly want to please you. Focus on cooperation and teamwork. Mention what's good, not what's lacking. See the positive in yourself and others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
