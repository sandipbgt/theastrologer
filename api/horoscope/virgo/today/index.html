    "horoscope": "Instead of being your no-nonsense, exacting self today you're more in touch with your emotions. Connecting with loved ones comforts you. Reach out to someone who's dear to you, either in person, over the phone or via the Internet. Reaffirm that bond. You can even reconnect with relatives or friends who are no longer with you, simply by remembering the good times you shared.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
