    "horoscope": "It's a good day to focus on getting your life on track in any way necessary. If you feel you haven't been as focused as you should be on work, your health or any other area, today's cosmic influence is perfect for recommitting yourself to a sensible regimen. It's also a great time to make plans for the near future -- particularly the next month, since today begins a new personal cycle for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
