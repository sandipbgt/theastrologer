    "horoscope": "You may feel more comfortable sticking close to home today. Simple activities like cooking and baking bring you a lot of pleasure, in part because they connect you with your past. As detail-oriented as you are, you might have fun tweaking a recipe until it's perfect! If cooking isn't your thing, treat yourself and someone you love to a meal out on the town. Breaking bread together leads to wonderfully intimate conversation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
