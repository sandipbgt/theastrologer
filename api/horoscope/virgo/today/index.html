    "horoscope": "Today, known quantities are for amateurs. It's time to break out and create your own destiny! Okay, if those words make you feel more nervous than inspired, it doesn't mean you're an amateur. It just means you'd rather know what's around the next bend. But even if you prefer a plan, you can find ways to honor the current cosmic energy. Switch up your routine. Have some impromptu fun!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
