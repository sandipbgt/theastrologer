    "horoscope": "Whether you're in a partnership with a colleague or a relationship with someone special, you want equality. And yet, you also want something more -- greater commitment, maybe, or freedom, or stability. Whatever it is, maybe you'll get it after today, which promises to be very productive. You're in can-do mode, and you know how to bring the right kind of focused attention. Remember, though, to be fair as you deal with other people. You're the one who wanted equality, so make sure your own behavior is balanced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
