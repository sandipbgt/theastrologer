It's chaotic, passionate and wonderfully mixed up, just like humans. Impose your sense of order on the world if you must, but don't get frustrated when the world doesn't want to wedge itself into your neat little boxes. Perhaps the universe's 'master plan' is a bit too big and colorful for that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
