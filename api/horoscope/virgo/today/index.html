    "horoscope": "Your powers of concentration are strong today. It's a wonderful time to go deeply into a subject of interest and analyze all the interesting facts you dig up. You might come across something mysterious or unexpected -- something previously hidden. If it's information that is sensitive in any way, your natural discretion will enable you to treat it with the right level of tact.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
