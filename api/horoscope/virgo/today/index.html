    "horoscope": "You have plenty of energy today to use for any project you find meaningful. While you're as hardworking and efficient as ever, you also bring a creative flair to your efforts. This gives you a private sense of satisfaction. But more than that, it may help you gain recognition from others for something they didn't realize was a part of your personality -- your fanciful, imaginative and fun-loving side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
