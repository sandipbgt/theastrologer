You're a strange little island poking out of the mainstream, and you seem to be getting more visible all the time. Don't be one of those people who try to conceal what's obvious to everyone by now. Don't bristle if they're more curious than polite. And whatever you do, don't withdraw your unusual self from the market. Flaunt what's peculiar about yourself today because, like it or not, that's going to be your biggest selling point.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
