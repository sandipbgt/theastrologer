    "horoscope": "Your natural attention to detail is heightened today -- almost to a fault. Tiny things you wouldn't normally notice suddenly stand out in stark relief. This makes it hard not to make mountains out of molehills. Everything seems important, whether it's major or minor! Try not to worry too much about the small stuff. Maintain an attitude of serenity. This will help you feel healthier, more centered and more in control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
