You see things a certain way, and you sorted out your morals and ethics long ago. But just because you have a strong sense of right and wrong doesn't mean you can't revise your views every now and again. Learn something new today. Don't cut yourself off from that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
