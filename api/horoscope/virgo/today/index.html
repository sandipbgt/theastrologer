    "horoscope": "Today offers you a unique chance to learn from a master. You've been wanting to develop your understanding of something that's important to you. Whatever goal you're pursuing, try imitating the moves of someone you respect. You're not stealing their mojo -- you're practicing to see if their methods could work for you as well. At the very least, you'll find that you need to do this on your own. So go on. Get started.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
