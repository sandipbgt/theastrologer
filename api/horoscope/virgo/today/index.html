In your work or in conversation, instead of going for the ready answer, keep searching for something more unique and original. The current energy emphasizes freedom of thought, and it favors inventiveness. That means anything less than sheer creativity just won't cut it. Think of this as your chance to set your mind free, and take it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
