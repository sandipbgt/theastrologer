But maybe they're being humorous -- or just human. Why not loosen up a little and join in the frolicsome atmosphere that's influencing so much of the world now? If you can't afford time off to play, at least try not to begrudge others their fun!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
