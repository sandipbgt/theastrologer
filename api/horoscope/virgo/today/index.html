Don't worry -- challenging the statistics and spinning data your own way is not the same as evading the truth. You're not being unethical, you're just testing out a different, fresh perspective. It's good that you have that sort of humility and self-awareness, though.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
