    "horoscope": "If someone criticizes your technique or behavior, rest assured that it's okay to be straight-laced. Rushing in like a fool isn't your style anyway.

You can make a decision once you have a few more pieces of the puzzle in place, and a better sense of the big picture.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
