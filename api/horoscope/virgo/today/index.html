You'll know when it's time to join in. Enjoy being an analytical observer. You'll get a kick out of discussing things with your friends. You could begin collaborating on a project that you'll tackle in the very near future. Spend time balancing your bank account or connecting with an old friend. Just don't expect too much. That way, you'll be pleasantly surprised.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
