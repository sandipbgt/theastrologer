If you have a good track record for stuff like this, don't stop now. And if you've never done these things before, it's clearly time to find your groove and hit your stride. Want to make all this hard work really meaningful? Bring others along with you. Whether you end up teaching them something or just showing them a good time, it'll reflect brilliantly on your karma.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
