    "horoscope": "Life becomes enjoyably intense today. You have such a logical outlook that sometimes it's nice to slip into this utterly emotional territory! It gives your passionate side a chance to express itself -- and yes, you do have a passionate side, even if you're normally rather reserved about it. Enjoy making a deeply feeling connection with someone you adore. You can also explore your own inner feelings and needs today, and develop greater self-awareness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
