Nothing's that important, at least not in the way you're thinking. First off, lose the symbolism and don't dwell on the deep personal meanings. It is what it is. Be less literal about your dreams and more practical about what's staring you in the face. You can find multiple uses for pretty much anything. This is what separates the amateurs from the pros.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
