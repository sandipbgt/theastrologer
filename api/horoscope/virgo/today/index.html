    "horoscope": "While other people are feeling moody today, you're more likely to feel emotionally attuned with your body, your loved ones and life in general. Where someone else's emotional state might be like choppy waves crashing on a beach, yours is all calm waters -- serene to the core. Enjoy this state of being so in touch with your own heart. Reach out to others with genuine compassion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
