You'll leave others in the dust as you work circles around them, barely taking a break. You subsist on snacks, even when there's a full lunch spread in the conference room -- you're just too busy to partake! Take a deep breath, ground yourself and take a break. You'll actually get more done that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
