    "horoscope": "You don't relish the thought of intense emotional encounters with other people, much less with yourself. And yet, you're dedicated to your relationships. Today, if a confrontation arises, you'll hang in there out of pure love. You genuinely want to work through any obstacles in your self-understanding or your connection with someone else. That's a strong foundation for meeting a loved one halfway and doing your part to connect with them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
