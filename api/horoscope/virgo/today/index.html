    "horoscope": "You're easily influenced today, so try to make intelligent choices despite this minor handicap. After all, if you're working with your spouse or colleague to arrive at some mutually agreeable decision, you have to represent your own needs as well as meeting the other person's. At the same time, try not to make too many waves. It wouldn't do to alienate the very people you're supposed to be cooperating with. In the end, an even keel is best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
