Suddenly, you feel just a little bit daring, and certainly bold enough to go after something you want. Whether it's a job, a date, a new house or anything else, gathering your courage and going for it is a great idea. Just make sure you don't charge ahead so blindly that you miss important details along the way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
