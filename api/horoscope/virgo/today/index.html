    "horoscope": "There's no need to behave yourself, at least not in the ways your parents and teachers demanded. You're free to heed the lures and attractions that keep tempting you off the appointed path. Some of this could be a rip-roaring mental adventure for you, too. Celebrate that big brain of yours as you review the logic and equations that hold the world together. Tinker if necessary. Savor the access. Play with whatever you find in there. It's all yours, and it could all be useful. Surprise your friends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
