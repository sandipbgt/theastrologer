    "horoscope": "Before going into a meeting with a superior or a client, take time to organize your thoughts. Make sure you've got everything laid out in your mind: What you intend to say, what your goals are and more. Once you're interacting with others, be sure to measure your responses. Diplomacy will be critical to your success. It's certainly worth the wait and effort. Even if you feel as if you're spinning your wheels, you're not. Every effort you put forth to speak kindly and employ a balanced perspective will count.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
