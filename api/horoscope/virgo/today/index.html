    "horoscope": "You're energetic enough to tick off all the items on your to-do list. Others around you aren't feeling nearly so enterprising. Remember, everyone's fate is intertwined in a closed system. If this means you spend a day waiting for others to get a move on, then so be it. Keep yourself busy. That to-do list of yours is always growing, after all. Now is a good time, though, to set your work aside and connect with someone special. Check in with friends, coworkers and associates. Make sure everyone's happy and on the same page.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
