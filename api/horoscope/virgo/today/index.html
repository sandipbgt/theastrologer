Perhaps this is because you're more in touch with your real self -- the source of inner strength and creativity that makes you who you are. Whatever's going on, you should definitely use this to your advantage. It may not be often that you feel so bold and dynamic!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
