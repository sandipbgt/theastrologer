    "horoscope": "If you're working through a problem or a project today, don't go it alone. Ask others for their input. You'll find that your ideas are honed by other people's perspectives. You can't think creatively in a vacuum, after all. And as much as you believe in your own sense of logic, your work can always be improved by another set of eyes. Plus, teamwork is just more fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
