    "horoscope": "Stick to the facts for now. If you want to get off on the right foot, try not to make wild guesses about strangers. Project a cautious, measured version of yourself until you know who you're dealing with. Inner turmoil is your private business, so don't go looking for new shoulders to cry on. And if you're bubbling over with the good stuff, you should only share it with those who can appreciate it. Maintaining this tough exterior might not be such a picnic, but it probably won't matter after today. Plus, you'll get points for self-control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
