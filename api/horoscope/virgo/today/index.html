    "horoscope": "It's important today that you stay mentally alert. When you're negotiating projects with colleagues or relationships with friends, do so both logically and steadily. You need to show others that you're fair and balanced, and that your analytical mind is reasonable as well as acute. If you're hoping to avoid any surprises, you may be in luck, but still, you should prepare for them. That way you'll be ready if anything unexpected pops up. You're good at thinking on your feet. Use that skill now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
