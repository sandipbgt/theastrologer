    "horoscope": "Today it's important to recognize and accept your feelings. You might think you have no time for silly emotion, especially if you have a lot on your plate. But the more you try to ignore your feelings, the more insistent they become. It's better to go ahead and take the time to get in touch with your inner self, the part of you that experiences life not through logic and reason but pure emotion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
