    "horoscope": "Set your practical concerns and your strong sense of logic aside today, and embrace the feeling side of life. A friend, or even a stranger, may need your sympathy now. You're more open to giving it, because you've experienced a softening under the current influence. Your kind heart takes on the burden of experiencing the world, which spurs you to offer warm advice and sensitive understanding to anyone having a rough time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
