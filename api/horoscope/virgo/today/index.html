    "horoscope": "You're detached from your feelings today, which makes it easier to check under the hood for forgotten memories. You can rummage through those old feelings and experiences, and reflect on where your life has taken you. You don't react to your memories with such fresh emotion anymore, which gives you a bit of objectivity. Just make sure that you let those old events go instead of putting them back into storage. It's time to close certain chapters of your life. Make way for a new version of yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
