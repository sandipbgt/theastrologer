You can't stand it when people act belligerent or aggressive for no good reason. It just isn't nice! But it's smarter to take a step back, yourself. Your own feelings of irritation could push you to argue or behave in other ways you won't be proud of later. Don't sink to their level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
