    "horoscope": "That logical, practical mind of yours clicks right into gear today. Anything you're trying to accomplish is made easier by your ability to see the bottom line, or the shortest distance from point A to B.

This makes it easier to see what's most important in any given situation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
