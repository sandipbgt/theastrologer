    "horoscope": "You're especially motivated today. The energy of ambition fills you, making you extra determined to reach your goal. And if anyone or anything stands in your way, you aren't afraid to get a little pushy! That's how much this means to you. Still, it's important to realize that some people may take determination as insensitivity. If you're working on a team, make an effort to be gentle, especially when issuing feedback or direct commands.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
