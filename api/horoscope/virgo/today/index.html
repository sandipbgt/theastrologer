It's a stretch, but fortunately, you're in a growing phase. Acceptance on both sides will help today. You'll have to bend, and so will the other person. After all, you're doing this for the good of the group, a principle that everyone should be able to understand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
