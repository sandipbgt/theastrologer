A tactfully worded question could lead to a deep, intriguing conversation with someone. By talking with them about their own problems and feelings, you'll gain understanding about your own. Just be sure not to judge or criticize when someone reveals their innermost worries and fantasies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
