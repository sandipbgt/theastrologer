    "horoscope": "Today, restlessness makes it difficult to focus on the task at hand. You might want to work with your usual efficiency, but ringing phones or frequent visits from friends or coworkers makes it impossible to concentrate. Plus, you're much more easily distracted than usual. You keep checking your email or phone messages, because you just can't seem to get absorbed in your work! Just do your best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
