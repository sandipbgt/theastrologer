    "horoscope": "Your passions rise to the surface of your consciousness today. How will you express them? Doing so consciously gives you control over what you let out, how much, and when. Of course, there's a lot to be said for spontaneity, too. Sometimes, a certain feeling becomes so strong that you can't help but let it out, no matter who might be watching! Have fun with this influence, Virgo. Let your hair down!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
