You're in a more subjective mindset than usual, which makes you more open to this kind of pondering. Visiting a place of worship could give you great insight. It's difficult to set reason and common sense aside, but if you can suspend your disbelief, you can enrich your perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
