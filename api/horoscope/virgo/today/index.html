    "horoscope": "To what do your neighbors owe this testy mood? The truth is, you're feeling at odds with yourself more than anything (or anyone) else. Do try to keep your demands reasonable today while you work through this unsettling energy. What you really want could soon show up, but it's more likely to come your way if you don't burn any bridges in the meantime. Put your energy into something constructive, like a big project at the office or cleaning up your house. You'll feel better if you're proactive instead of reactive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
