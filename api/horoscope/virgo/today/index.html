    "horoscope": "It's a good day to work hard with your future security in mind. You can research career opportunities or investment strategies, or simply apply yourself at the office, knowing you're building toward a better reputation and a solid financial profile. If you're out and about today, be cautious with your credit cards. It's not a good day to splurge on unnecessary items unless you're taking some kind of calculated risk.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
