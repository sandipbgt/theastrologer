    "horoscope": "The harder you try to stay focused and organized today, the more chaotic life may seem. Perhaps an efficient, logical day just isn't in the stars. Try paying closer attention to your feelings, and to how your friends and family are doing emotionally. You might find that you were using logic or busy work to mask your feelings, or to avoid an emotional confrontation. But facing things is much more effective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
