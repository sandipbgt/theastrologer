Sometimes it's nice to connect with the parts of your life that hold their own familiar rhythm: cleaning the house, for example, folding laundry, or cooking a meal for someone you love. Beyond that, your aspirations are relatively modest. You've no need at the moment to rush out into the world and try to achieve some big, noisy success. The other people in your life should respect your currently thoughtful pace.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
