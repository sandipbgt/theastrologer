Yes, your current mission seems to be renewing the old ways and celebrating traditional values. Relish what's naturally occurring and standard issue. Who needs the add-ons, anyway? It's not as if you have to fill any holes in your collection or try to impress someone. Live how you were meant to live today. If you like how it feels, keep it going.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
