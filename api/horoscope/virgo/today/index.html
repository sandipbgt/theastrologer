    "horoscope": "Impulse moves aren't your style. You're generally too cautious to act without first thinking it through carefully. But if you're ever likely to be impulsive, it's today. Your energy is high, and you might be a bit irritable. You have a greater need than usual to assert your opinions. That might spur a spirited debate, or even an argument at home. At work, however, it may be better to hold your tongue.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
