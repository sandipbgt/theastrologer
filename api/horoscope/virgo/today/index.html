    "horoscope": "You seem to have run out of steam. Despite your ambitious plans and lengthy to-do list, your energy is at a low ebb. Your self-control stirs, turns over and goes back to sleep. There's a message here,. Don't push yourself. Stay on top of what's necessary today, but cross anything else off the list. With luck, you'll get everything done that you need to. Then it's time to rest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
