    "horoscope": "Mood swings combined with tense personal situations are making you fantasize about doing something radical -- something that will really show them.

Later, fear of failure won't loom as large, and you'll be able to make better decisions about any issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
