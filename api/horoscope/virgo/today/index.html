    "horoscope": "You're well mannered by nature, and that comes in handy today. You just don't like the feeling of stepping on others' toes in a social situation. You're always conscious of other people and their needs and feelings. This makes you an excellent host. Since the current cosmic influence only increases this talent of yours, it's a great day to throw a party or call a meeting. You'll create a nice atmosphere for everyone to enjoy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
