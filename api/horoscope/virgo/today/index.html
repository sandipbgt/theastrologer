Now is the time to make your apologies, clean up your mess, and resolve whatever emotional drama you scripted. Rebuilding others' trust in you will be an uphill trek, but you have to start somewhere. If it'll make you feel better, the first day is the hardest. After that, you ought to get into the habit of playing a much cleaner game.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
