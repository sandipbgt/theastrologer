    "horoscope": "You're a problem-solver, and you rely heavily on reason to help you solve any day-to-day issues that come up. But today, a vague sense of confusion makes it difficult to focus on the problem itself, much less a logical solution. Perhaps logic isn't the best approach. Tune in to your instincts instead. This may go against how you normally operate. But it will inform you more truly than mere judgment or reason.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
