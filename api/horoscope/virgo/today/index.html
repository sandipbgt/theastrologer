It's also a good day to look into applying for a loan or making an investment, because you're doing your research thoroughly enough to make sound decisions. Any risks you might take will be calculated, and virtually guaranteed to pay off.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
