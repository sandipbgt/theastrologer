Warm, lighthearted energy is blowing through your life like a sweet little breeze. Follow its scent; it'll lead you straight to someone special. Or, if you're going solo right now, treat yourself to dinner and a movie. It's good to take yourself out on a date. Sometimes, your own company is the best there is.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
