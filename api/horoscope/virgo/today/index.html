    "horoscope": "This is an excellent day to meet with your peers or with a gathering of like-minded people. Group activities are favored now, particularly ones that promote a sense of equality -- forums in which each individual is respected, regardless of their knowledge or skill level. In this type of environment, everyone feels safe and valued. And you enjoy gatherings in which each person is considered an important part of the whole.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
