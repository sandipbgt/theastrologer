    "horoscope": "'Everything in moderation' might be one of your favorite mottos. 'No one likes a showoff' might be another. Notice anything a little, well, prim about these two sayings? They both hold plenty of truth, but you don't have to live by them all the time -- especially not now, when things are going just your way. Let your natural talents shine, no matter who might be looking. Use them to their best effect today. Tap into your practical nature for positive results.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
