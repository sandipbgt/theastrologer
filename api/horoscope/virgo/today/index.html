    "horoscope": "If there's any conflict going on in your life right now, it's only because you lack perspective. You may think you're experiencing troubles at work or with your sweetie or friends, but really, you're just temporarily stuck in a narrow world view. One way to decrease tensions is by broadening that view. Stop thinking you have all the answers, or that you need them immediately. It's okay to float a bit. Open your eyes and ask questions, even open-ended ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
