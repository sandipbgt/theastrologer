It's easier than usual to blaze through your to-do list, and you'll probably have energy to spare when you're finished. But tension could come along with this vigor. If you develop a headache or stiff shoulders, take it easy. The same applies if you begin feeling impatient. Make a conscious effort to relax.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
