Minor issues seem like a much bigger deal when you have zero sense of humor about them, or zero flexibility in dealing with them. What would help? Broadening your focus and shifting your expectations. Better yet, do away with those expectations altogether. That's the true meaning of flexibility, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
