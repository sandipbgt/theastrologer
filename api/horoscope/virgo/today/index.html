    "horoscope": "Today, solidify your plans for the coming weeks and then double-check the details. Make sure what you're about to set into motion is realistic. Do you have the resources you need -- the supplies, funds or network of friends or colleagues? Have you thought through the potential consequences of your actions? Think of this planning process as a fun logic puzzle. The prize is success and a job well done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
