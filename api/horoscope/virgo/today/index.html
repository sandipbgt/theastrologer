    "horoscope": "Too much enthusiasm may destabilize your world today. Even if it goes against your philosophy that anything is possible on this wild upward spiral, don't overdo it. And learn to cheerfully take no for an answer instead of grumbling about it. That'll just make you plummet when you really should be leveling out. If you want the good times to keep on rolling, focus on calm appreciation instead of the usual wild celebration. Yes, that means a different kind of fun, but also something more sustainable. You're not getting any younger, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
