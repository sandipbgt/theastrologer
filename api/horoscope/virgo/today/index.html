    "horoscope": "You're in an odd mood, aren't you? One minute you're all warmed up, even passionate, but the next you're irritable. Try not to be snippy. A good rule of thumb -- don't say anything you'll have to apologize for later. If you're feeling closed-minded, well, do your best to keep it to yourself -- this weird feeling will pass. In the meantime, you probably won't learn a whole lot. Just put some solid effort into breaking out of the weird mood you're stuck in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
