    "horoscope": "You're focused on making things neat, trim and organized today. Physical fitness might be high on your list of priorities, or a clean house. At work, you might be the one to volunteer for the difficult job of organizing the files or clearing out a storage room. You do enjoy the feeling of being of service to others. And then there's the sense of satisfaction that comes from a job well done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
