    "horoscope": "It's a good day for a job interview, a loan application or any other situation in which you need to make a favorable impression. You're always polite -- even reserved -- but now your social graces are even smoother than usual. You're especially sensitive to other people's moods and needs, and you want to meet those needs if you can. People are sure to notice your kind gestures and tactful comments.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
