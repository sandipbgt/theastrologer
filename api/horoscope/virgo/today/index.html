    "horoscope": "It's easy for you to get caught up in the details of everyday life. But today you're simultaneously grounded and passionate. There's something important -- some creative work, perhaps, or a new health and fitness plan, or even a fledgling connection with someone special -- that you'd really like to get off the ground. The energy you're running on now is purely your own, in its strongest, most distilled form. It's okay to be intense, impulsive and earthy, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
