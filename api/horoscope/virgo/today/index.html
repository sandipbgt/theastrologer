    "horoscope": "It's unfortunate but true -- plenty of people around you are far less informed. Sometimes you get annoyed at their shortsightedness, but not today. No, today you shine as a beacon of sound knowledge and fair-mindedness. Of course, it's really just increased focus mixed with your usual detail-oriented approach to life. But hey -- if you pass for wise, so be it. Whatever it takes to bring others to your corner, right? If you play your cards right, you'll have a whole team willing to do your bidding.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
