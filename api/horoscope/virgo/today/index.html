    "horoscope": "You're devoted to your loved ones. And when they're in need, you're a truly formidable force as you set yourself to the task of helping them. Today, you may have the opportunity to give someone advice. Use your logic to get a picture of the problem. But use your heart to feel your way toward a solution. Blending these two strengths is the best way to support your loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
