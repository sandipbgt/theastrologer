    "horoscope": "Do your best to accommodate others' needs and wishes today. Of course, you always do. You naturally take other people's feelings into account, and you always help out when you can. That's the perfect attitude for the current lunar energy. Cooperative action takes you where you want to go. And there are side benefits to being helpful, too. For one thing, people are more likely to support you when you need it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
