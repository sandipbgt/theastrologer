    "horoscope": "This day is all about using your naturally keen perspective to your best advantage. You're feeling grounded and focused, and you know which goals you want to reach first. Best of all, you're practical enough to stand back and observe what's going on around you, rather than jumping into the fray without a plan. Use that skill. Think through your options, be discerning in your choices and don't settle for anything less than your best effort. Like the best, you make all this look easy, which is a big part of your ultimate success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
