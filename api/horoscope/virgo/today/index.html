    "horoscope": "You expect a lot of yourself, and today your sense of purpose is even more keen than usual. It's a wonderful day for making plans for the next month, since the focus is on details and it's the start of a new personal cycle for you. Don't pressure yourself to get a lot accomplished today; give yourself time and space just to consider what's really valuable, and come up with a workable strategy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
