Insisting that you're smart could actually lead people to doubt your intelligence! Don't work at cross purposes with yourself. Instead, calm down, think things through, and meet your own expectations -- and no one else's. That way, you can tone down some of the strange uneasiness that's coursing through you, and other people will take notice of your new, humbler, more thoughtful approach.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
