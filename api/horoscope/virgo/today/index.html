Many people are in the mood to work together toward a common goal, especially one aimed at helping someone or something -- the environment, for example, or disadvantaged people who could use some assistance. If you're a part of a group like this, your natural skill set is a real asset. You'll keep everyone grounded in reality and practicality, when they might otherwise base too much on idealistic notions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
