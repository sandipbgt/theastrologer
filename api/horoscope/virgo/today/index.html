If you tried to disguise how strong and excited you're feeling, they'd just smirk at you. So go ahead and enjoy in the fun you're having. You deserve it. You've worked hard for this, after all. Now you're beginning to reap the rewards. Smile openly, and accept people's compliments and congratulations with grace.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
