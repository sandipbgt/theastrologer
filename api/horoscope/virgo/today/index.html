Nothing seems up to par at the moment -- and that includes you and your own performance. Try not to judge yourself and others so harshly. Irrational worries are welling up within you, and you're responding with perfectionism. Be gentle with yourself. Accept your feelings, Virgo, even if you don't understand them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
