Your vision of the peace you want to create is clear, so put some time into getting your house or office in order today. Cleaning, organizing and putting away all your things creates psychic space -- but don't criticize your family if they want to goof off instead of organizing their closets!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
