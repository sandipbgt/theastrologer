Your instincts might be to push for this, but if you want to avoid resistance, take a more moderate approach. Yes, you want this. Still, don't let on just yet exactly how much. That can come later, when you're more certain you have others' support. For now, play this carefully, like a high-stakes card game: Keep your cards close to your chest and your expression neutral, and track your opponents' every move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
