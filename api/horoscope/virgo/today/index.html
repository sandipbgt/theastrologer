But you won't go out of your way to seek a gathering, and if you do get together with friends, you could end up hanging back. That's just the mood you're in. An interesting, intellectual conversation could draw you in, but otherwise you'll keep your own company.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
