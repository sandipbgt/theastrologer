    "horoscope": "If you have a temper, watch it closely today! Like many people, your energy is up. You'll probably notice plenty of folks behaving in impulsive, haphazard ways. Reckless behavior is definitely not your style, but try not to fault others for it! When people feel judged, they tend to act out even more than they would have otherwise. So offer your good advice, but steer clear of unsolicited criticism.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
