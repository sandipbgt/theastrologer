    "horoscope": "Sure, you're capable of working long and hard today. But what about playtime? Life is for living! And you're especially attuned to the pleasures of the senses, like good food or a warm hug from someone you love. Get responsibilities out of the way so you can relax. Then get mellow and settled in your bones. Imagine you're in a hammock by the ocean: That's the vibe you should be going for!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
