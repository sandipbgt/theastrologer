You're also interested in letting your loved ones know how loved they are. You can even be a rock star at the office, as your techniques and skills are in great demand. Maybe it's time to consider raising your rates -- you're certainly worth every penny.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
