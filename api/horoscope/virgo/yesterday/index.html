    "horoscope": "Access your empathetic side today. Your usual perspective tends to be logical and dispassionate, but now, many people's experiences have moved into a purely subjective realm. That makes it more important for you to treat them with kindness and compassion. Show yourself this same caring concern, as well. If you have an emotional issue, it's better to feel it out than to ignore it or explain it away.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
