Of course, if you think things are fine the way they are, you won't be as enthusiastic about the plans others are making. But if there's one thing you know how to do, dear, sensible, it's putting your head down and doing your job regardless. That shows true strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
