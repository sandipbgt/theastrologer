Many people are dealing with unsettled feelings now, and you could be among them. Perhaps it's just a result of having your sensitivities stirred up. Whatever it is, try not to attach too much importance to it if you're a bit blue. Melancholy feelings will be fleeting. You'll soon feel like yourself again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
