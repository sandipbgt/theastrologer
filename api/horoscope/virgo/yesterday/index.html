That kind of behavior won't fly, and neither will cranky complaints. Don't be someone who will embarrass you later! Instead, look for more effective means of control, especially self-control. If you absolutely have to do something spontaneous and physical to let off steam, try some midnight, moonlit dancing. Maybe even a simple trip to the gym will help you work off some of this kookiness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
