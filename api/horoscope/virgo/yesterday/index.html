    "horoscope": "Despite the pressure you feel now to complete a certain project, there's no sense in rushing things. You probably won't finish the job today, anyway, so take your time and make it a high-quality effort. Your sense of ethics is unfailing, and you'll impress everyone -- higher-ups, colleagues, clients and loved ones alike -- with your good taste and your commitment to excellence. And you'll gain a lot of satisfaction from a job done correctly. After all, you're happier spending the day doing one small thing perfectly than putting less time and effort into a second-rate job.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
