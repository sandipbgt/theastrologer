    "horoscope": "Extend your warmth and generosity to the people around you today. You're in a cheery mood, buoyed by the general lightheartedness of the day. You're even feeling creative, so if you get some time to yourself, explore your own imagination and bring your ideas into concrete reality. Your emphasis is on practical items, so activities like building a birdhouse or repairing an item of clothing can bring you a lot of pleasure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
