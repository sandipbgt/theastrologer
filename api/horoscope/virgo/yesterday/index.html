    "horoscope": "Your perspective is almost entirely logical today. You trust your own and others' perceptions only if they're grounded in fact. This works well in plenty of situations -- attending to mundane business, for example, or constructing a professional or academic project. But when it comes to dealing with people and emotions, a different approach may be needed. Don't forget that rationality doesn't apply to feelings. Be open on more than the mental level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
