    "horoscope": "Inspiration may be low-key today. If it hits you at all, it'll do so at a subtle level. But you're sharp-witted enough to recognize a good thing when it comes knocking. When you hear that quiet tapping, you'll know this is your chance to pursue the truth. Trust in your instincts as you move along this personal journey. Whatever it is you're after, you'll discover the real thing soon, and it's sure to dazzle you with genuine beauty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
