    "horoscope": "Maybe you're concerned about a lack of passion in your romantic relationship, or a sudden dip in creativity at the workplace. Even so, don't nag at anyone. Life isn't a long, slow, steady train, you know -- it's more like a roller coaster, with lots of ups and downs. If you're in a down, try taking a more proactive approach. You can offer someone constructive advice, or better yet, focus on how you yourself can work to improve the situation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
