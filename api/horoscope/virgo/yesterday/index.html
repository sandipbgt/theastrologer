    "horoscope": "You're quite goal-oriented today. This helps you work industriously toward a specific outcome. And when your energy is this directed, there's very little you can't accomplish! Whatever you need to do, you're willing and able to do, whether that means networking, researching or simply putting your back into it. Best of all, you can serve as an example to your children or coworkers -- anyone who is watching you do what you do best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
