    "horoscope": "At work, your fingers are a blur of capable activity. Your mind is dynamic, and others can almost see the machinery of your brain shifting in beautiful, functional symmetry. It's clear to everyone that you're accomplished in many areas. But don't fritter away this strong, careful energy on meaningless activities. Instead, turn your attention toward some specific task that means a lot to you. You might be very surprised by what you can accomplish today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
