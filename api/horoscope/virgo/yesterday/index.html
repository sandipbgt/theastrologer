    "horoscope": "Your deepest emotions bloom up today from your unconscious mind. Your dreams may be vivid, even when you're awake. Strange, subjective images and fantasies occupy your mind. These may not be images you can figure out or explain away, but you can analyze them -- later, when your perceptions are sharper and clearer. For now, just write down your dreams and impressions, or resolve to remember them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
