    "horoscope": "Your sense of logic is as strong as ever today, but it's enhanced by your intuition, which deepens under the current cosmic influence.

You can use your sense of compassion to understand yourself better, or to feel closer with someone you might otherwise criticize.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
