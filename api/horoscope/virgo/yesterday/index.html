    "horoscope": "It may be difficult to get much accomplished today. It's hard to concentrate. Your mind is moving a mile a minute, and your mouth may be doing the same.

If you can't focus, it's just the effects of today's lunar energy. It will pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
