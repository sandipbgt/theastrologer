Accept what you can't change as well as determine if there's any part of the equation you can influence in a positive way. Be sure to treat other people humanely, especially if you're feeling put out. Try to respect everyone's vitality, even if you disagree with how they use it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
