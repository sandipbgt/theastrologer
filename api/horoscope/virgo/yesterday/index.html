    "horoscope": "You feel young and righteous, full of dreams and fears and the resolve to do something about them. Well, it's a good thing you feel that way, because certain people are saying that you're sounding more like a grouchy old windbag. Your utopian future seems more like a direct rip-off from some ancient philosopher. Stop replaying the past. The present works better, especially when you're operating under your own steam. Yesterday's thinkers and dreamers had great ideas, it's true. But instead of quoting them chapter and verse, find ways to use this stuff in the world where you live.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
