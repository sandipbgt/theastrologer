This could mean surrendering the battle that's taken up so much of your energy in the last weeks or months. Maybe it would mean eating your words or drinking the Kool-Aid. But you know what? Everyone gets to be wrong sometimes, and everyone gets the opportunity to change. So maybe it's time to step over your hard line. Rethink your loyalties. Treat yourself to a fresh perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
