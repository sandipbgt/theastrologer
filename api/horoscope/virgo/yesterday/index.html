In fact, it'll be in your best interest if you don't show your hand today. At the same time, keep one eye on what everyone else is doing. Develop a feel for their rhythm and where you fit into it. You want them to be ready for what you have to offer, so timing is everything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
