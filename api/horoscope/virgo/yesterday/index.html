    "horoscope": "You're extra cautious today. Before you'll make a move, you'll do thorough research -- checking with people, reading up on a subject, or anything else that applies. You won't feel certain about making a decision until you've got all the facts laid out in front of you, so you can make a full analysis. But don't be too afraid to take a chance. What's the worst that could happen? Mistakes aren't that bad.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
