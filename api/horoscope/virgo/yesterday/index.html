    "horoscope": "You have quite a professional demeanor today -- not that you ever present yourself in an inappropriate manner! You, more than most, understand the importance of making a good impression. Today, that might include dressing in a stylish yet conservative manner or communicating your thoughts and ideas in a measured, careful way. If you have any sort of interview on the day's agenda, you'll do beautifully, because you're carrying yourself so well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
