    "horoscope": "Today it feels especially good to spend time with people you care about. You don't care what you do together, as long as everyone's happy. If a disagreement arises, do your best to help negotiate peace. This is one of those days when arguments aren't fun for anyone, and disruptions are upsetting for all. Avoid tension by measuring your own statements and responses. Try not to criticize or judge anyone!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
