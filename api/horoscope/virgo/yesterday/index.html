    "horoscope": "You might seem casual and offhanded to others, but you're really a perfectionist. Your friends and family are currently regarding you warily, expecting you to lash out any second. They recognize that irritable look in your eye. Why not surprise them? If anyone tries your patience today, don't let it get under your skin. Remain pleasant and accommodating. Hey, sometimes a fake-it-till-you-make-it approach really works. Pretending you're patient actually makes you feel more patient.
