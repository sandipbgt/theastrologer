Your heart and mind work together, helping you focus on the parts of your life that need attention. Today is perfect for reaching out to loved ones and tending to things at home, but make sure to save some time just for you, too. Reconnect with yourself as it is to connect with other people you care about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
