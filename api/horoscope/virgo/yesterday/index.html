    "horoscope": "Everyone has inner demons of one kind or another. Yours happen to be priggish. But, that doesn't mean you have to give in to them. If anyone can ignore their dark side, it's you. Therefore, when the urge strikes to use a few barbed, well-chosen words to put someone in their place, resist. When your irritation makes you want to scream, don't give in. You'll see: Tolerance and generosity will fill your heart again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
