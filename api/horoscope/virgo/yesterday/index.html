But don't reject a person or theory just because it seems strange. Inspect your own feelings of discomfort or mistrust. Is it possible that you're just operating on assumptions that are a little too narrow? It's a good day for becoming more tolerant and open-minded.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
