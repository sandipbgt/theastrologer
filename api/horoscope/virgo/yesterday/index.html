    "horoscope": "The energy boost courtesy of the current influence could quickly translate to nervous energy for you. And when you feel anxious, irritation can set in fast. Especially if you're working closely with other people, do your best to stay calm, especially when you feel nervous or upset. Overreactions are common now, and most people are reacting without thinking. Do your best to stay even-tempered, and give people the benefit of the doubt.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
