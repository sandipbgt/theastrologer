    "horoscope": "Trickery may feel justified today if you think you can get away with it. Maybe you can. But if you have a conscience, this would also be a time to worry. Remember how irritated you felt when someone else went around breaking the rules? Turnabout doesn't seem like fair play when it all turns around on you. Don't take it that far. Break the cycle. You won't have to get yours back once you decide that nobody owes you anything. Move on to find a game that truly works for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
