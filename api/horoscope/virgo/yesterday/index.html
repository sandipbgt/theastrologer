    "horoscope": "An intellectual approach to life works well today, and that's perfect for you. You're good at analyzing data, so take a scientific approach to developing a project or solving a problem. If you get lost in big ideas, it's okay. You'll return to the mundane, physical realm soon enough. For now, feel free to spend time in your head. You might end up learning or discovering something you never knew before.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
