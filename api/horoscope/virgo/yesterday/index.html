    "horoscope": "Something's awry. Focus and data are scattered all over the place, and things are a mess -- your least favorite state of existence. Worst of all, people who should be above reproach are being blamed. The thing is, though, it really isn't anybody's fault. Try to cool off today. Get some exercise and move your attention from your head into your body. Try deep-breathing techniques to help you stay calm despite yet another annoyance. It's only one day, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
