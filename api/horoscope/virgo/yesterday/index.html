Maybe you think they're just overreacting or telling a sob story -- but to them, their plight is probably enormous and very real. And compassion doesn't cost you a thing. Sometimes, the best help you can give someone is your understanding.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
