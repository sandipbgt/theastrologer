    "horoscope": "You enjoy living sensibly and morally. Does this make you boring? Who really cares? Usually life moves at such a hectic pace, especially for detail-oriented you. You need and deserve this calm, peaceful day. Let everyone else think and do whatever they please. You'll be comfortable at home, tending to life at a basic level: eating, resting, regrouping and connecting with the people you love most. For now, let yourself retreat.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
