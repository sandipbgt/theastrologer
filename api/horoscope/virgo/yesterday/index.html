    "horoscope": "Today promises to be one of those days -- you know the kind. You might feel vulnerable or anxious, but if you aren't conscious of these emotions, or if you aren't sure of the reasons behind them, you might ignore them. But ignoring them only makes them grow stronger! And that could lead to spending the whole day in a funk. If you have the blues, be gentle with yourself, and pamper yourself accordingly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
