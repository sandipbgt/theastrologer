Even if you're normally quite shy, you might find yourself the center of a group of people -- and really enjoying the attention! Hey, you have as many funny stories as the next person. It's all about choosing your moment. You'll be a hit if you tap into the current influence and use it to hone your dramatic timing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
