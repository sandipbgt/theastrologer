It's fine to take a day or two every now and then for a mental health break. Let yourself daydream. Indulge in a nap. Read a book or watch a movie, or get lost in your favorite music. These are the kinds of things that bring you pleasure now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
