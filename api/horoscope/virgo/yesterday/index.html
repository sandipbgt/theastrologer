    "horoscope": "Today is a good day for building bridges. If you've experienced tension with a neighbor, friend or colleague, now you can make steps toward resolving it. Just focus on kindness and cooperation. Instead of pushing your own points or agenda, let others take the lead, or at least have equal input. You may be able to adjust to their wants and needs more easily than they could to yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
