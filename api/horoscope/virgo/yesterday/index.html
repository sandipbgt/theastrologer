    "horoscope": "Though you pride yourself on being genuine, you're playing a certain situation like a game. You've got all the right moves, and you're ahead of the pack. Your competitors don't have a chance at overtaking you. You might even play with them a little, letting them think they're going to prevail, just before you swoop in and make yet another decisive move. This is fun, but don't let your success distract you. Keep this winning streak going for another day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
