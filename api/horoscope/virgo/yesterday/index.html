    "horoscope": "Your whole life is carefully planned out, step by step. Why not be a little bit spontaneous today? You're in a good mood, and so are many other people. The whole world feels sunny and bright, even if it's rainy outside. And everyone is in the mood for a party. It's also a great day for romance. Connect with someone special, or treat yourself to a good movie or a delectable dessert.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
