It's especially fun to indulge in a flirtation now, or express yourself through art or another creative act. This puts you in touch with the best parts of yourself, so you can take everything of value that you hold inside you and demonstrate it to the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
