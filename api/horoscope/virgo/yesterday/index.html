As you move through your day, you might feel as if you're moving one step forward and two steps back -- or just around and around in circles. This isn't an efficient way to get things accomplished, but it may be the best you can do. Simplify your agenda as much as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
