Or will you ignore it in favor of your usual plans and logic? It's up to you. But sometimes, it's a good idea to let your hair down, just a little. On the other hand, when the energy from the cosmos is this unpredictable, caution may be best after all!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
