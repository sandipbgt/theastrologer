You probably already stick to a realistic budget, and you certainly believe in restraining your impulses in order to set aside resources for the future. These principles could apply to your diet and exercise regimen, too. You want to maintain your health into your old age, so focus now on eating wholesome, nutritious foods and getting some exercise. Your future awaits you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
