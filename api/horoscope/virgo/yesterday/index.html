    "horoscope": "Your sharp intellect is honed by the current cosmic energy. Now your sense of logic is especially shrewd. This is great for situations or problems in which it's important to remain emotionally detached, so you can be effective in devising a solution or determining your next move. But sometimes a little emotionalism isn't such a bad thing. Reasoning with your heart as well as your mind keeps your perspective well rounded.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
