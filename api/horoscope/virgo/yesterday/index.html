    "horoscope": "Discreet discipline is your strength today. You've got things covered on all fronts in that quiet, competent way of yours. And although your heart may be calling you home to take care of important details there, yet the workaday world also insists on your presence. Somehow you'll coordinate a comfortable flow of energy between all the demands pressing in upon you. You'll get everything done with grace and finesse, and everyone around you will appreciate and remember this day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
