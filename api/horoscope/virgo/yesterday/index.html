Your hands are sure and your heart is true. You'll bring the right sort of focused attention to anything you tackle. So what if you're a little boring? This feels fine -- in fact, better than fine. It's the right way to be today. You can be dashing and daring later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
