And the truth is, that's what you'll be today, unless you do your best not to wallow in your worries. These anxieties aren't such a big deal. But at the moment, you're convinced they are. Give your friends and family a break, if possible. Smile and make light conversation. If you need a few moments to freak out, find a quiet spot to be alone, and remind yourself that this, too, shall pass.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
