    "horoscope": "There's a general lull in activity today. Things are moving forward seamlessly at work and in your relationships. This is a quiet time but that doesn't mean its useless. Perhaps you can use this time to dream up something creative. You spend a lot of time being practical,, and living in your head. Today is a good day to connect with your heart and your imagination, and see what comes of it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
