    "horoscope": "When it comes to administrative tasks like keeping an organized filing system or managing a group of children or employees, you're naturally adept. Today, that managerial skill is heightened. You rise to the expectations of your client or employer, or you simply live up to your own high standards. And you feel good about what you're able to accomplish. When you get right down to it, that's the most important thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
