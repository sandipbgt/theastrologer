You know you've done some things well and others not so well, and you're looking forward to the chance to take a step back and see how you're doing. This is a great time to ask for assistance or feedback from a friend or colleague. It's a good idea to give your critics a warm welcome today. Does it make it easier if you know they'll love you no matter what? Because they will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
