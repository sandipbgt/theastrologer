    "horoscope": "People know you as a good friend in a time of crisis, because you're able to be discreet about their problems or the feelings they choose to discuss with you. It just isn't in you to betray someone's trust. Today, you may have a chance to give someone advice or emotional support. Let them know you're there for them to lean on, with no strings attached. It's no less than you'd hope for, yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
