    "horoscope": "You aren't normally a sentimental type, but today, beauty has a softening effect on you. A gorgeous sunset seems to reach right into your soul, and a piece of artwork is unusually appealing. The company of your friends is especially peaceful, too. If a disagreement arises, your best bet is to stay calm and logical, and focus on compromise. That way, you can return to the pleasant vibe as quickly as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
