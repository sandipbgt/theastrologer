You don't want to burn your bridges, so be tactful in explaining why you're saying goodbye. Who knows? Someday, you might want to rejoin -- maybe even soon. On second thought, maybe you should hold off on making any big moves until you're sure this isn't just a passing case of the doldrums.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
