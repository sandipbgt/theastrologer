That's the current energy at work, shaking things up for everyone. Trying to resist this influence would be like resisting a force of nature! You're better off planning for the unexpected, and just going with it. Maybe you can even have a little fun with spur-of-the-moment activities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
