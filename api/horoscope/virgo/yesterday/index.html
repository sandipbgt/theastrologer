    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if you lack focus today. And trying even harder than usual to be practical or direct won't work. You'll find yourself blocked into a corner or at a dead end -- frustrating, to say the least! But that's just the universe pushing you to let go of the illusion of control. Accept that you're in a dreamy, imaginative mind space. Let your mind wander, and don't try to make sense of everything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
