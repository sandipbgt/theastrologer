    "horoscope": "Today, your usual, logical mindset gives way to a more emotional one. Suddenly, you're feeling sentimental. Old memories may resurface, making you laugh or bringing up unexpected nostalgia. If you're dealing with family issues, it's easier to be compassionate. After all, reason doesn't have much of a place when it comes to matters of the heart. Blending the two gives you a much more well-rounded perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
