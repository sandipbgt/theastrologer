And there are sure to be more than a handful! People are talking and moving fast now. Your own ideas come quickly. Your mind may be a jumble of thoughts and intentions. It's hard to focus on just one! Expect lots of stops, starts and silly conversations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
