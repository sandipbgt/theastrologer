But low energy is holding you back, or perhaps there's some point of confusion that still needs to be clarified. Your best bet today is not to push it. Soon, things will become clearer. For now, try to coexist peacefully with uncertainty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
