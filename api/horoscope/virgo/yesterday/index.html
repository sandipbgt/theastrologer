    "horoscope": "Today's influence may not provide the most lighthearted, frivolous energy, but you feel quite positive and centered nonetheless. You're filled with the deep sense of well-being that comes from knowing you've worked hard and done your best. Keep up the good work throughout the day. Stay focused on getting through your task list. Going at a steady, measured pace ensures that you won't wear yourself out. And it gets the job done.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
