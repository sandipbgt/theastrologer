    "horoscope": "Life's edges get a little fuzzy today. For many, this softening is a pleasant experience. But for you, it can be nerve-racking! It feels as if everything is just slightly out of your control. And you do enjoy feeling as if you have a firm handle on things. But maybe this is a good opportunity to experience a different perspective. Don't judge or even process your emotions. Just feel them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
