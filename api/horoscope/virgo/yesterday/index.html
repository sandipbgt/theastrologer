    "horoscope": "In spite of your big ambitions and sweeping panoramas, the god or devil is always in the details. Honor the spirit of what you're doing, but leave nothing to chance. Your special know-how will keep it all divine, unless of course you're aiming for that little touch of wickedness. You're allowed to blow your own horn today. You're a free agent or maybe a free angel, and you're welcome to go after some extra publicity if it'll help your cause. Once you have all that attention, though, be careful about how you let it influence you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
