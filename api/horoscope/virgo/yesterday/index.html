    "horoscope": "Being a perfectionist at heart, you're probably running around today like the proverbial headless chicken, trying to get every little detail right in whatever you're working on. But there's no need to drive yourself crazy. Life isn't supposed to be this hectic. Try focusing on your family and friends instead of on some idea of perfection that probably doesn't matter to anyone but you. Enjoy yourself,.
