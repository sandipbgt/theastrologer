    "horoscope": "High energy and quick thinking characterize today's cosmic influence. Of course, you have a naturally keen mind, so now your perceptions are coming extra fast and furious. If you're working on something detailed, make a conscious effort to slow down. Otherwise, you're likely to skip important steps in your rush to the finish line. And when dealing with other people, avoid harsh criticism or jumping to conclusions!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
