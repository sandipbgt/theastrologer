If so, you're the right person for the job, because you have such a solid grasp of long-term planning. You're a believer in reaping the benefits of good, hard work. Model this value for your family or coworkers today. Give them a standard of excellence they can aspire to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
