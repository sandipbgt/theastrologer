Secrets and mysteries could come to light now. Keeping secrets from your partner, on the other hand, isn't so easy. Honesty truly is the best policy now. Just be sensitive even as you're being direct. Say things graciously, and they'll make an impact.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
