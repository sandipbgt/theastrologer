    "horoscope": "Gloom and doom feel unusually present today, like a dark cloud hanging over your life or an inner sense of disquiet. It's just your perspective, however, and not a reflection of anyone's reality but your own. Don't threaten your friends and family with your worries. Instead, let them brighten your day with their sunshine. This gift will get you through this brief yet potentially intense period of discomfort. You can also channel your nervous anxiety into something constructive, even if it's just deep-cleaning the house.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
