This is more easily said than done, partly because it takes a lot of trust in yourself. It's okay to be wildly creative today. You can fix any loose ends later. This is a good exercise for you,. Odds are, you'll feel better and happier by the end of the day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
