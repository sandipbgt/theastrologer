Other people are in party mode -- and you don't have to be the only one making beds, cooking meals and cleaning up after everyone. Join in the revelry while you can. Later, others might even help you clean up the mess. If you make cleanup a group effort, people are happy to pitch in, but you have to give them a chance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
