You're more apt to take a cautious, conservative approach. This is your version of success, so take this situation as slowly as you need to. You can make a decision once you have a few more pieces of the puzzle in place, and a better sense of the big picture.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
