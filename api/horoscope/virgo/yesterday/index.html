    "horoscope": "Today, your shy side may emerge. You prefer the comforts of home to the rigors of the outside world. You're far more at ease now in the company of family or longtime friends than among strangers. Stay home, if you can. If not, keep that warm, connected feeling alive with a phone call or email. That's the beauty of modern technology. You can feel close to home, no matter where you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
