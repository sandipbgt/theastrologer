If you feel you aren't being treated with the courtesy you deserve, it may be time to take an honest look at your own behavior and agenda. Whatever you're trying to achieve now, it can only be helped by treating others with love and respect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
