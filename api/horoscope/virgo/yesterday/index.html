Your mere presence can have a grounding influence on someone who's feeling worried or scattered, and you're always good at giving practical advice for solving a problem. Plus, today you're relaxed and easygoing enough to offer that advice in a patient tone. That means no one feels criticized, and that's a good thing,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
