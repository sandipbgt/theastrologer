    "horoscope": "Keep your intentions pure and your intuition on the front burner. Let knowledge make room for guessing. If you start feeling love or inspiration, it'll be more about your mood than about any reason you could ever explain. Go with the flow for today. Cynics might sneer at your compromise. Defeatists might urge you not to surrender. But what do they know? Don't let other people's jealousy or negativity trash your own very cool experience. If this is where you want to be, then this is where you belong. It's that simple.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
