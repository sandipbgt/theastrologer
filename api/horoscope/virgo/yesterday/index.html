Ask a trusted friend or coworker for their perspective. They may be able to identify minor details you've overlooked, or strengthen your overall approach. It'll feel good to know you've put in extra research and gotten plenty of feedback, so you can be confident this thing will work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
