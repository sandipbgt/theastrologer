As much as you might prefer life to be neat, clean and efficient at all times, you have to accept the fact that you occasionally need other people. Whatever's going on, consider this a warm welcome back into human society. This is what being alive is all about, so enjoy it. Be glad there's affection in your life. That's far more than some can say.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
