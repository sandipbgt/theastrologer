    "horoscope": "Something in your life needs rebuilding today, but doing so could take all your energy, leaving you feeling snappish and preoccupied. Sometimes, it's good to go ahead and let it all hang out, but today this could drive your allies away. You need their support and assistance too much. Find a way to calm down and get along with others. Try channeling your excess energy into your passion for your work or your goal. That would really help,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
