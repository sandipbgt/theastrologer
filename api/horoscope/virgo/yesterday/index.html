    "horoscope": "Don't be too hard on yourself today if you don't accomplish as much as you intended. Your energy is certainly high, so you should be able to do it all, right? Well, not so fast. You're moving along so quickly that you might miss important details. You'll have to go back later and fix things, once you realize what happened. It's better to slow down and be thorough the first time around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
