    "horoscope": "Turn your keen eye toward your personal and professional partnerships today. It's a good time to correct any imbalances in your relationships, and make sure everyone is contributing their fair share of effort. But if you discover any sort of problem, be sure to avoid nagging or criticism. Most people are in a cooperative mood now, but that could sour if you take an overly nitpicky approach to solving issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
