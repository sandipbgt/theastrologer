    "horoscope": "You're in a festive mood today. Your energy is high and strong. Positive thinking makes you feel powerful from the inside out. It's a great day to go after something you want -- a job, perhaps, or a certain opportunity or relationship -- because you can pursue it with great energy. Often you're shy and reserved, but now you can charm or persuade anyone standing between you and your heart's desire.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
