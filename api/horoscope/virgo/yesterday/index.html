You could teach a class on being faithful and dedicated, after all,. It's in your bones, or your soul, this ability to devote yourself completely to some person or cause. And it's high time that you saw a little compensation in return for your faith and devotion. Accept whatever applause comes your way now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
