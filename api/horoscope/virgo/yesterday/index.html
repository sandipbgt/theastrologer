Your ability to see things as they really are will help you determine your next move. And don't forget the power of teamwork. Plenty of times, you'd rather do things yourself, so you'll know it's all done right, but right now, your friends and coworkers can be a real asset in anything you're trying to finish well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
