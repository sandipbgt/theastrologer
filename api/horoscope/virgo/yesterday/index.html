    "horoscope": "You feel deeply connected with your past today, or perhaps with your family. It's a good feeling to be able to see the continuity of your own life -- the people and experiences that have made you the person you've become. Find some way to honor that connection and influence, whether by calling a relative to tell them you love them, looking at old photos, or telling stories about your childhood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
