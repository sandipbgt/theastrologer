    "horoscope": "Compassion counts for a lot today -- even more than usual. It's important to be kind to people, especially if you're feeling irritated with them. Brusque energy has no place in today's slow-paced, mellow vibe. And being critical of someone is sure to hurt their feelings. In fact, you're more easily affected by others' opinions, yourself. That's all the more reason to think generously of people. Then they'll do the same for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
