Today's energy is much better suited to getting some work done at the office.  Better yet, spend some time with your sweetheart. It's okay that the playhouse will be empty. That just gives you a chance to rehearse your lines diligently for your future audience. You can perfect your approach. Soon, you can really impress them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
