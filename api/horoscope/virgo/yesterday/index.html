    "horoscope": "A quiet strength is coursing through you. You're feeling creative, in touch with your own gifts and intelligence. Good thing you're modest by nature, because boasting about your talents wouldn't do just now. Instead, be moderate and respectable today. Keeping up appearances will open doors for you. Once inside, you can do whatever you want. You've earned your audience and your support, fair and. So play this with caution and skill. Play to win.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
