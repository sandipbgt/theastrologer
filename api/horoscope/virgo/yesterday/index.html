    "horoscope": "It might feel like the stakes are high, but you can still take it easy today and simply observe. Don't worry that opportunities will pass you by -- they're likely to find you with remarkable ease. In the meantime, conserve energy and start making a plan to make this thing happen. Besides, the stakes aren't nearly as high as you think -- you just really, really want this. Desire is good. So is a slow, steady ascent to success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
