You tend to take your time with new ideas or methods, so you can understand and absorb them. Only then can you incorporate them into your own life. But now you may have to step outside your comfort zone. Challenge yourself to be flexible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
