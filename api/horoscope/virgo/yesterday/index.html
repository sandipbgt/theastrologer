The bottom line is that you're feeling relaxed and looking excellent. It'll be easy to deliver a faultless performance today. But don't stop there. Your firm grip on the odds and careful management of resources should help you keep it going as long as you can. Big bucks might not be as far away as you think.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
