    "horoscope": "Don't try too hard to stick to your usual routine today. The current energy is restless in nature. You'll find that the more rigid you become about following the rules, the more the universe tosses obstacles in your path. Is it possible that the cosmos is messing with you? Hmm... That's something to consider! Or, just lighten up and laugh at yourself. And honor these antsy feelings by breaking out of your mold.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
