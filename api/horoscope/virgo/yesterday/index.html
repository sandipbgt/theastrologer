    "horoscope": "Get out of your head today and into your heart. That means connecting with loved ones in a warm, sincere way. It's a great day to talk about your feelings, especially if you're worried about something, or if you've been experiencing tension in one of your relationships. Genuine, meaningful conversations increase the intimacy between you and a friend or partner. That allows you to support each other like true friends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
