    "horoscope": "What's that sound?  And what's that smell? Someone's down in the kitchen whipping up a breakfast that's taking you back to the early days. Family matters will wake you up like nothing else ever could. These are the people who know you best of all. They can dish the most dirt about you, but of course that shovel works both ways. Expect to go deep for a day or so. Just don't sever any common roots. All the excitement should be about love and understanding, because you'll never fall far from this tree.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
