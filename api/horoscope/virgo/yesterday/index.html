    "horoscope": "Don't be so negative about your chances. Enough with the impossible excuses and what-if scenarios. You're on track to succeed, and you know it. Stop wavering around your choices, because not committing is yet another choice. As the old joke goes, it's time to grab the bull by the tail and look the facts in the face. You're here and, like it or not, this is what you have. Engage your power tools and get busy. If you keep yourself occupied enough, the day will just fly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
