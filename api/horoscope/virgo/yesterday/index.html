    "horoscope": "Staying focused and practical-minded may be a losing battle today. As dreamy and spaced out as you're feeling, concentration just isn't in the stars. It's best to accept the current cosmic energy for what it is, and let your mind wander. Rearrange your schedule if you can, because you're almost sure to stray from your to-do list by the end of the day! Tackle creative work or take a nap.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
