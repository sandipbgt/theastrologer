    "horoscope": "Today is your day to set plans for the near future. You're clearheaded and logical now. With such a keen sense of what's practical and what isn't, you can lay out well-founded plans and attainable goals. Remember, as you think forward to the month ahead, to keep your projects simple and realistic. Aiming high isn't as important as staying grounded, which allows you to be both optimistic and self-assured.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
