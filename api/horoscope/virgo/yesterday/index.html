    "horoscope": "A reserved mood sets in today. You may feel detached from even your closest emotional connections. You have a lot on your mind, or perhaps on your to-do list. Either way, it's a good time for intellectual work, but not so much for intimate, one-on-one moments. If your spouse or best friend doesn't understand your need for space, explain it gently, so you can do your thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
