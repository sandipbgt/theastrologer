If you and your spouse or business partner have had a disagreement, you can talk it out now. Focus on finding common ground. You'll find this to be easier than you expected, since you're both willing to do what it takes to make things work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
