    "horoscope": "There's a sense of discovery in the air today. Why not let yourself get caught up in it? You don't have to stick to the people, places and philosophies you already know. Open your mind to something new! This is sure to bring a sense of excitement, since you're a thinker by nature. You might end up proving your own convictions all over again, but at least you'll know they're well founded.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
