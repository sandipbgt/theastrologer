    "horoscope": "Attention to detail is one of your many strengths, so it's no wonder you're so exacting about your own system of getting things done. But today, you're being a little thoughtless about other people's systems. They have agendas too, you know, ones that are every bit as valid as yours, much as you hate to admit it. Open the floor to discussion. This should be a democracy, not a dictatorship. Listen to your friends', loved ones' or coworkers' ideas, and incorporate them into your own. There really is room here for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
