    "horoscope": "Don't pick fights with invincible enemies. Don't look for sympathy where you'll never find it, or otherwise set yourself up for a fall. Don't let worry snowball into fear. Downhill is the wrong direction today. Fight the gravity, find the comedy, and ascend smiling all the way. Not convinced it can happen? Use the power of positive thinking. Try to feel as cocky as you look. Just as you can talk yourself into a bad mood, you can also start your change for the better from inside. Visualize that inner glow ASAP.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
