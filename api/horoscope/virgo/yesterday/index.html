    "horoscope": "You're a hard worker, and you're rarely off task. That's why days like today are so valuable -- they remind you to relax and have a little fun! Gather with your friends, even if that means telling jokes in the break room at work. But leaving your responsibilities behind and doing something purely social is even better. It's a great time for a romantic date. You're feeling a little friskier than usual!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
