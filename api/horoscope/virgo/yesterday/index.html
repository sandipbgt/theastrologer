    "horoscope": "Turn your attention to detail toward your home today. Make your personal space more tidy and comfortable. If something needs fixing, such as a leaky faucet or a drafty window, take care of it. Putting this time and effort into your house or apartment gives you a centered feeling. You know you're spending your money and energy on something worthwhile: a more solid, secure home base. That's an investment in your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
