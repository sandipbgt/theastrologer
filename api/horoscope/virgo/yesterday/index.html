    "horoscope": "You're naturally a bit shy, and today you're especially reserved. Making a warm, easy connection with someone may have to wait a few days, but that's okay. You can use this brief period for solitary pursuits. Your thinking is as clear as ever, and sticky, tricky emotions won't cloud your logic. In fact, you might err on the side of being unsympathetic -- another reason to spend time with your own thoughts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
