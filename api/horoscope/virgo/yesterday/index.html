    "horoscope": "Restless energy abounds today. Other people might enjoy this. In fact, you might, too -- at first. But after a while, your own racing thoughts combined with others' high spirits could start to make you anxious! Also you may feel somewhat indecisive, because of your increased ability to see all sides of a situation. You might feel distracted by too many choices, tasks, or phone calls and emails that disrupt your focus.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
