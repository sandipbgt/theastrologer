    "horoscope": "Today you're impressionable. Staying that way is a matter of choice. Don't let childhood issues cloud grown-up situations. You're in charge here, so don't let any feelings of anxiety or confusion get the best of you. Be clear. Let your needs and wants be known, and respect others' agendas as well. Surely there's a way you can work with others to find a resolution that suits all of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
