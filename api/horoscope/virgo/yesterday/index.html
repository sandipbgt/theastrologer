    "horoscope": "You're a hard worker, but today it's time to relax and enjoy the company of your friends. You're in the mood to share conversations and good food, so gather a group together. You're also open now to romance, so spend time with a significant other or watch a chick flick. The main thing today is not to spend the day alone, unless it's to be creative and feed your muse.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
