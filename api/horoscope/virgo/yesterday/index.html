Today can be about exploring your options and seeing what's what, so you can make an informed decision later. Be sure to focus on what's right for you, and not other people's wishes or expectations. This is your journey, and you'll have only yourself to thank or blame at the end.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
