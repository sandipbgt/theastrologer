    "horoscope": "If you indulge in a sweet or spend a little too much money today while you're out shopping, don't flog yourself about it. You're always so self-controlled, and now you deserve a bit of a splurge. You'll rein yourself in before it gets too far. So have some fun today, and enjoy yourself, along with the company of your loved ones, too. After you get your work done, of course.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
