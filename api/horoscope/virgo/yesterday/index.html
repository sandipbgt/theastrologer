    "horoscope": "Pay attention to others today, or entertain thoughts about your sweetheart or crush, if you have one. In some way, you should indulge in a little romance and fantasy now. This isn't just frivolous fun, you know. It's important, because it connects you with the person you love, or with your own vision of the relationship you hope to create. If romance is not your focus right now, you can still connect with others in a meaningful way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
