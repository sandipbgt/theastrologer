    "horoscope": "Your endurance is high today, especially for tasks that some might consider tedious. You actually find a long workout or busywork at the office to be rather enjoyable right now. Repetitive motions or quiet activities are soothing, because they help you focus. So take a long walk or jog, or get some filing, budgeting or cleaning done. These are the kinds of accomplishments that make you feel good at the end of the day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
