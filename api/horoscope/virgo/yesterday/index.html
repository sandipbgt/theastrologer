But you can see the fear that lies beneath their bluster. That deep, intuitive understanding of others' feelings and motivations is a real gift. Use it to connect with someone at an honest level. Let them know they have your unfailing support if they need it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
