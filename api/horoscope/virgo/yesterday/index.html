It's a good time to smooth over any tensions you may have been experiencing with someone you love, or someone with whom you work closely. You're practical enough to realize that conflict gets in the way of the smooth functioning of your team. That helps you set your ego aside when you're talking out an issue and finding a resolution.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
