    "horoscope": "High spirits surrounds you today. Dare to let your hair down -- loosening up and having a good time will do wonders for your soul. Soon, a new personal cycle starts for you, so today is perfect for a little break. Even if you can't take time off work or away from your family duties, you can get into the spirit of fun. Tell a witty story. Make your spouse or coworker laugh.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
