    "horoscope": "Your analytical mind is humming at a higher frequency today. Get ready to flex your mental muscles along with your emotional ones, because you understand life at both levels now. This gives you a unique window into others' thoughts and feelings. If a friend needs advice, you can be a great source of wisdom and support for them. And providing them this service -- your love and care -- feels wonderful for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
