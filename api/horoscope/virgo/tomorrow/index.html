You can be as tough or as tender as each situation demands, because in each case, you're practical enough to figure out the stakes. People are sure to come to love and respect you, if they don't already., everyone is taking note of your elegant ability to rise to meet each challenge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
