    "horoscope": "You're dropping literary and cinematic references right and left,, and everyone's truly enjoying your company. You're just so interesting to be around -- so culturally and artistically aware. Keeping it coming shouldn't be too hard -- everything you do will be in good taste. That's just how it is today. The world around you seems softer and finer, and you're responding in kind. Other people value you for this. Don't be surprised if, in a few days, you have even more allies and admirers.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
