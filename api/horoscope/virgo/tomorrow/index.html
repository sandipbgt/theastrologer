    "horoscope": "Normally you might be a bit shy, but today you're feeling lighthearted and playful, and you're in the mood to connect with friends. If you're at work, you'll make extra time to share a laugh with your coworkers. And once you've put in your hours, you want to have some fun. Go out with a group if you can, or stay home and play games with your family, roommates or internet buddies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
