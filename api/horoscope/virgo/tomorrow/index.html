The dominoes are aligned just so, and you took special care as you set them up, with your usual attention to detail. One little push is all it'll take to set things into gorgeous, stunning motion. Then, you'll step back and marvel as things seem to fall into place of their own accord. Don't forget to take a little credit -- you made it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
