But that doesn't mean you can freeze the rest of the world to fit into your perfect moment, so stop nitpicking at the new and unusual. Don't keep taking shots at the people who want to change things. Instead, you might want to add a little variety to your life today. Who knows? Soon you could be embracing the very changes you once mocked.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
