    "horoscope": "Satire feels virtuous today. You see yourself as a champion of the weak and oppressed. You're using your sharp insights to let some hotout of those who dare to fly their balloons too high. Yes, it's easy to criticize when you feel morally superior. But think about your audience. Are they laughing at you, too? Are you more of a clown than a critic? With so many different perspectives, the same joke isn't always funny for the same reasons. Take it in stride instead of feeling insulted.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
