But if you have to wait for someone to grasp your question or suggestion, you'll quickly grow testy with them. Try not to make any snap judgments on other people's intellectual abilities. They're probably just taking their time to consider the possibilities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
