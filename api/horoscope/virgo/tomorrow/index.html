Self-sacrifice feels like the highest form of devotion you can show a friend or family member. If you want to let them know you're there, give them your strong, steadfast emotional support. With your sense of logic paired with genuine feeling, there's no problem you can't work through.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
