    "horoscope": "Whether it's the coffee or the nonstop excitement, you're probably feeling too wired for your own good right now. And this isn't that robust, can-do feeling of concentrated energy. If anything, you feel more delicate than energetic. Mistakes could happen, whether you act or fail to act. Calm yourself today instead of letting your worries wind you up even tighter. All challenges can wait awhile. And if some big opportunity passes you by, oh well. Consider what might have happened if you'd grabbed it before you were ready. Then consider yourself lucky.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
