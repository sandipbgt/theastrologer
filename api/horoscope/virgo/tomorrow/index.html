And yet, if you were ever going to challenge everyone's expectations, including your own, today would be the day. Perhaps a new person or idea captures your imagination. Maybe a question lurks at the back of your mind, tickling your consciousness. It's asking, 'What if?' And only you can find the answer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
