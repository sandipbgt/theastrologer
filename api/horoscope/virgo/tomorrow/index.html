    "horoscope": "Today's influence makes you extra cautious. You're thorough in your work, double- and triple-checking your final product before declaring it complete. You're also careful in communicating with other people, whether regarding personal or professional matters. This is a good thing, especially if you're trying to conduct any type of business or to make a good impression. But don't be afraid to loosen up a little around people you know well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
