And whether it's happening in the world of business, art or sports, hey, that's just how the game is played. Your quick moves and surprise turnarounds may look like something impulsive, but they're really growing out of decisions that you made long ago. People might not believe that now, but in your heart you know it's true. Anyway, as the current champion, you don't have to prove anything to anybody.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
