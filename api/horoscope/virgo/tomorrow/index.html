    "horoscope": "If you feel yourself getting more and more critical as the day wears on, it's definitely time for an attitude adjustment. Check your perfectionism at the door and take off those precision-vision sunglasses. Instead of looking for what's wrong everywhere you go, try to see everything that's right. Is the glass half empty or is it half full? It's all a matter of perspective,. Start viewing life in a more positive light.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
