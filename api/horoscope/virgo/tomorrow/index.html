    "horoscope": "If social gatherings are more compelling than your duties today, give in to the pull. Many people now are more in the mood to laugh and chat than to be diligent about their work. There's nothing wrong with that. Everyone needs a break sometime! If neglecting your responsibilities just feels wrong, then set some priorities. Get the important things accomplished early in the day. Then take a break to gather with friends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
