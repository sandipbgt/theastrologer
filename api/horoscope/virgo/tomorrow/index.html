That means focus on the points you can agree on, rather than criticizing the other person for their differing perspective. Maybe no one is completely right or wrong. The picture is so much more pleasing to the eye when you view it in shades of gray.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
