    "horoscope": "Balance and harmony hold special importance today. Take this opportunity to impose gentle order on any area of your life that's gotten a little messy. This might mean extending an olive branch to a neighbor or friend with whom you've experienced some tension. Perhaps you need to rein in your spending if you've been splurging lately. Of course, you aren't normally one to go overboard. Any extravagances should be easy to correct.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
