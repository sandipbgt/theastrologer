    "horoscope": "Today should be interesting and varied. Friends and coworkers are surprising sources of good material. In general, your conversations seem more engaging, and it's more fun than ever to ask questions and provoke a response. Be sure to keep an eye and an ear out for informative answers. Someone could give you information you can use later. You're also feeling tuned in and amorous, so connect with your sweetie, or  ask someone appealing out on a date.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
