    "horoscope": "You have an instinct for accuracy and a drive for honesty. Your wholesome world view includes a certain down-to-grit, because after all that's what the world is made of. Little details and obvious truths motivate you to speak up and reach out. Be completely businesslike today. Whether you or someone else launches this thing, ride it to a profitable conclusion. Use all your best qualities like accuracy, honesty and diligence. Live up to your full potential.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
