    "horoscope": "Be more observant today. That will include being aware of your surroundings and paying attention to what people are doing. But don't just stand there watching. Get involved. Making friends with your neighbors would be a practical next step, if you're not already hanging out with these folks. Open your home to them and make them feel welcome. If you all enjoy these good times, they'll start to come by more often. Stop acting like a guest in your own life. You really do live here, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
