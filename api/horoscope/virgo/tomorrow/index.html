    "horoscope": "Your keen mind, always adept at analysis, wants to dig deeply into a certain subject today. You feel intellectually and emotionally turned on and tuned in, as if you're lit up from the inside out. Every bit of knowledge you gain translates quickly to an increase in understanding. If you're seeking to understand yourself and your own inner workings, so much the better. Self-improvement can grow by leaps and bounds now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
