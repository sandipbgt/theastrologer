    "horoscope": "Ordinarily, you meet a challenge with crafty zeal. After all, you love analysis, efficiency and imposing your own system of organization on a chaotic situation. But at the moment, you're not too good with challenges. Instead of taking them as an opportunity to flex your muscles, you meet them obstinately, pinching pennies all the way. A few days of disciplined flexibility and generosity will get you a lot further than trying to shove your way through some roadblock.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
