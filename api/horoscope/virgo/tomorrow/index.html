If you're at work, your clients or employer are sure to notice and appreciate your self-discipline. If you're at home, you're a calm, stabilizing presence for your family. You make them feel more grounded, because you're so grounded, yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
