    "horoscope": "Many people are feeling sensitive today, so it's especially important to treat them gently. Criticism could be taken as a personal attack, even if you didn't mean it that way. Under the current influence, it's much more effective to avoid giving even constructive feedback, and stick solely to appreciation and encouragement. In a few days, when people are feeling stronger, you can be a little more honest about what needs improvement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
