You're a brave, beautiful person when you let your light shine. In a group of friends or business associates, you can surprise everyone -- including yourself -- by demonstrating definite leadership qualities. You aren't just a quiet person in service to others. You have your own strengths and desires, too!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
