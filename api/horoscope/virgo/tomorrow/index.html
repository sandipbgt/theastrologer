    "horoscope": "Your inner artist emerges today, so let your creativity flow. And don't limit it with unrealistic expectations of perfection!

Recognize your imagination as fertile ground. You've sown many seeds there, and today you can reap the rewards to great effect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
