You can dig into details, analyze options and file it all away for a later date. But organization can be difficult now, even for someone as system-oriented as you. And follow-through is next to impossible! Rely on your practical nature to carry you through.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
