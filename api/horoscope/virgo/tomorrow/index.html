Well, they're counting on your dependable, judicious decisions right now, so learn to like it. How hard can that be? Once you find the hook, you'll be totally immersed anyway. Just don't forget why you're here having fun with this. Always keep the rules in mind, and wait another day before throwing caution to the wind. You can please yourself later once you're out of the public eye.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
