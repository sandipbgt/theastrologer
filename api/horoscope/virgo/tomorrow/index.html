    "horoscope": "You say it's human nature to stake out your position and proudly defend it beyond all reason. Pride can also look kind of silly from the outside. It's so easy to work yourself into a frenzy and back yourself into a corner. Easy, yes, but why even go there? Put yourself in the right frame of mind for making compromises. Brooding won't get you anywhere at all, plus it sucks all theout of the room. Remember to smile today. It looks a lot better on you and probably feels pretty good, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
