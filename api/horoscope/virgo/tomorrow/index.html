    "horoscope": "Your no-nonsense manner might come across as abrupt today. You're just taking care of business, but depending on your responsibilities, a gentler, warmer approach might work better. If you have to work closely with other people, do your best to soften up and approach them with a genuine smile on your face. If you're in a managerial position, try not to criticize too sharply. Aim for constructive feedback with a healthy dose of praise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
