    "horoscope": "You're so efficient! And driven, and passionate, and as always, in tune with whatever you're working on so diligently. Relish your own economy of movement. You feel more yourself now than usual, and this is a real gift. You're in perfect harmony with the universe, and will be for the entire day. You're as centered as it gets, so use it well -- you can accomplish a lot now, with a minimum of effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
