    "horoscope": "You're infused with a calm, centered feeling. You work hard to nurture and support yourself and the people you care about, so pat yourself on the back for taking such good care of things. Since your current focus is on matters close to home, this is a good day for sorting out any issues you may have that relate to your house or your intimate relationships. Cook a good meal for your family.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
