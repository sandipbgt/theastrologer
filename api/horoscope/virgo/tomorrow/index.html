The world needs a little tension to hold it together, because otherwise everything will droop and melt into a puddle of syrup. Speak from the id for today. Greed, lust, scorn and pity are all OK in moderation. It's all part of being alive, and last time you checked your pulse and breathed on a mirror, you were definitely alive.
