    "horoscope": "Give yourself gentle leeway today. You're more emotionally sensitive than usual, and you aren't used to feeling like a tender bruise! Every little comment seems to hurt your feelings. But don't denounce yourself for being irrational. And if it's someone near you who's being overly sensitive, don't criticize their weakness, either. Sometimes it's best just to baby yourself, or someone else. You don't always have to be strong, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
