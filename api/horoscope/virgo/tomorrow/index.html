    "horoscope": "Life feels exciting right now, doesn't it? You can feel it in your blood -- things are going to happen today. Be sure to keep your wits and scruples about you, because you'll need both. Of course, you don't need the advice. You've got your keen mind, plus your warm and tuned-in heart. Using these tools, you'll see the situation clearly and make the right choices, so just go with your inner voice. It won't steer you wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
