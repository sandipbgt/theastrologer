    "horoscope": "You can be quite shy and reserved, but today, it's easy to tap into a warm, playful vibe. Even if it's miserable outside, you have a natural spring in your step. Your energy is high, and you feel bold and optimistic. What can you do with this bright, fun day? The world is your oyster. Find an adventure. If you can bring a friend along for the ride, so much the better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
