    "horoscope": "You're in a quiet, sober mood today. In company, you're reserved, even with people you know well. Your attention has turned toward cleanliness and organization. It's a great day to clean up some area of your home or office in preparation for the month ahead. Clearing the decks physically helps you do the same on a psychological level. Then you'll be ready for whatever might arise, whether it's planned or unexpected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
