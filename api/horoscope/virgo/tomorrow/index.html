    "horoscope": "You're results-oriented: You like the process of a project, and you like to see the products of your efforts. This is a good day to finish up an endeavor or resolve an issue you've been facing. Take a deep breath. Remember to focus your energy on tying up loose ends rather than starting something new, or going in a completely different direction. And as you work alongside friends or colleagues, be kind as well as driven. Newcomers and those unaccustomed to your love of detail may need a day or so to get up to speed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
