    "horoscope": "Cut right to the heart of what's wrong if that'll get you a laugh. Friends and strangers will love you for tickling their funny bone. But keep things in perspective, OK? The jokes might serve your purposes, but your awareness of what's actually going on is much bigger than comedy. Each random  piece is part of someone's grand scheme. Maybe you can help them, or maybe you know enough to stay out of their way. Sometimes you can do yourself the biggest favor of all by not getting involved with other people's craziness. As you know, you can be crazy enough on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
