Activities like napping, daydreaming and writing in your journal may seem impractical to you, but these are just the kinds of things you should do today. Your dreams may hold important information that you'll miss out on if you ignore them. Pay attention to your intuition, too -- that inner whisper that may seem silly, but holds good information.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
