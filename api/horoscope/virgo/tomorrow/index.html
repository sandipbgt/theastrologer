    "horoscope": "Enjoy another calm, relaxed day. Do things that feel good physically: Take a nap, eat wholesome food -- but not so wholesome that it doesn't taste good! -- and get some exercise. Walking, jogging, yoga and other endurance-based movements are best, since they center you in your body. After a long day of working hard and treating yourself right, indulge in some small pleasure, like a piece of chocolate or aof ice cream.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
