    "horoscope": "All the sensible, practical thinking in the world may not make a difference today. Doubts and worries seem to creep in. And it's difficult to focus on the task at hand. Your energy isn't as high as usual. Things you thought were simple and definite now seem slippery at best. It's like trying to hold on to a fish with your bare hands! Hopefully you will get a new, better perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
