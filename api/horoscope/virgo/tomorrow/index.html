    "horoscope": "Don't get caught up in superficial things today. The deeper issues deserve your full attention -- tackle them with messy gusto. At work, throw yourself into a project by asking your work-mates for brainstorming help. Ideas run fast and rampant now, so write them all down, because it's easy to feel confused or indecisive. If a relationship is stressing you, don't underestimate clear communication. Stick to your truest, deepest feelings rather than dwelling on the surface of your insecurities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
