    "horoscope": "Cooperative action is highlighted today. You'll do your best work in a group, as other people check your ideas and whittle them down to the best and brightest. You're a sharp thinker, yourself; you could be instrumental in helping someone else hone their theories. Your constructive criticism might make all the difference to someone struggling to create positive change. Use your insight to help them distinguish between useless tweaks and smart revisions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
