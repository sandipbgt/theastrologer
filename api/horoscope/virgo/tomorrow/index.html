    "horoscope": "Balance, unity and consensus are at the forefront of your concerns today. By nature, you're emotionally grounded. Right now it's especially easy -- and important -- to maintain that equilibrium. That's a big help in situations that might otherwise get tense. Think business negotiations or a serious talk with your partner. You're aware of the other side as well as your own. This enables you to find a solution that works for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
