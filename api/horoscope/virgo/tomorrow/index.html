    "horoscope": "You're a bit impressionable now. You're too quick to accept or reject what you're told to. It's unsettling if you think about it, and you should definitely do some thinking here. Hold yourself back today, so you don't upset a delicate balance by charging ahead with cocky ignorance. The world is a lot more complicated than you'd like to believe. Don't trust anyone who tells you independent thinking is a waste of time. If you can get a look at the hand they're about to play, you'll see exactly who benefits from this round.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
