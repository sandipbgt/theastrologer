    "horoscope": "Welcome to a passive, low-energy day. Your usual ability to focus may fly right out the window. You might find yourself daydreaming when you're supposed to be working, or falling asleep when you're supposed to be alert. Make time for a nap, or do something quiet like reading or watching a movie. Most of all, let your thoughts wander. Embrace any feelings or impressions that arise, no matter how silly they seem.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
