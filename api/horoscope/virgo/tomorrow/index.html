    "horoscope": "Your usual calm, graceful energy could be a bit off-balance today. Maybe you're moving around too quickly, spurred by high energy and grand visions of the future. It's wonderful to be so filled with hope, but your practical side will surely come in handy today. Be sure your plans are grounded in fact and feasibility before you move forward. At the same time, don't pop the bubble of your dreams completely.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
