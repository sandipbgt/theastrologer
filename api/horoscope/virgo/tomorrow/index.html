    "horoscope": "Your physical and mental endurance is off the charts today. Have a lot on your task list? No problem. You're focused and ready to tick off your duties one by one. A methodical approach works best, and logic is your secret weapon. You're too practical to waste time and energy -- or to cut unnecessary corners. You'll do a thorough job that screams quality, and produce something you can be proud of.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
