    "horoscope": "Helping people lead better, healthier lives is part of your nature. But this time, you're not just serving others. You're all working together on something that means a lot to all of you. Common vision drives this project today. The pleasure of being part of a well-functioning team only increases your own energy. There's really not much you can't accomplish now. Whatever you tackle, you'll watch it pick up speed soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
