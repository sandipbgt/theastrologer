    "horoscope": "You've been winding yourself up and driving yourself crazy by focusing on a deep, subtle sense of dissatisfaction. It's like an itch you love to scratch. Stop it, already! If you keep this up, you might end up doing something rash. Accept the way things are instead of trying so hard to change them. After all, if you put a lot of effort into something and it's always a struggle, perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
