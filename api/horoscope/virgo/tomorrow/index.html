    "horoscope": "You'll be on a leisurely quest today. Make your inquiries from a position of comfort. Go with your gut instead of spending too much effort on research. This is your time,, and you can follow your own style. So what if the rude and simpleminded are laughing at your refined methods? They couldn't get half as much done in twice the time, and it wouldn't be nearly as cool as what you're offering. That's why you're not even breaking a sweat. You already have this thing in the bag.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
