    "horoscope": "With such enthusiasm, you're physically nimble, mentally stimulating, and the center of everyone's attention. But you won't play the fool -- you're as dignified as ever. In fact, with your poise and wit, you could easily end up attracting someone -- a new client, perhaps, or someone who's interested in getting a little closer. When opportunities arise, seize the moment! Be thankful you're so keen-eyed and sharp-witted. You won't likely let a good thing pass you by.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
