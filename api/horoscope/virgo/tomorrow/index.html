The best way to attract love is by doing what you love. The best way to lose idiots is by not giving them anything to work with. OK, maybe you're locking the door, but you don't have to throw away the key. After a day of hanging with your chosen tribe inside your magic circle, you'll be ready to get out there and face the big, weird world again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
