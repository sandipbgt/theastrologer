You get things done, and even better, you know why your specific goals are important in the first place. Make a solid, practical plan and recruit help from others. Be sure to record your progress, because later, when the way isn't so clear, you'll appreciate having a roadmap to success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
