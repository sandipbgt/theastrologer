    "horoscope": "It's a good day to analyze your emotions, or to help a friend understand theirs. Look deeply into things that interest you now, and notice the nuance in human relationships. You may discover that you're feeling things you didn't expect, or that you're experiencing certain insecurities. If so, take a compassionate view of them. Treat yourself as you would a good friend who came to you for advice and support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
