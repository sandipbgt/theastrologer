    "horoscope": "Taking care of other people comes naturally to you, but today is all about taking care of yourself. Good health is only as permanent as you make it, so listen to your body and become aware of your habits. Are you eating a well-balanced diet and exercising enough? And -- this is a biggie for you -- are you scheduling enough rest and relaxation into your day? You're so perpetually busy, you'll never slow down unless you put R and R on the calendar. Pencil in a little me-time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
