It's clear to everyone that you're accomplished in many areas. But don't fritter away this strong, careful energy on meaningless activities. Instead, turn your attention toward some specific task that means a lot to you. You might be very surprised by what you can accomplish today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
