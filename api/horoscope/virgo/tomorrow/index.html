    "horoscope": "A calm sense of abundance improves your whole day. You can feel it in your bones: You have everything you need. It's in that centered, satisfied feeling that comes from smiling at a coworker or a stranger on the street. It's in the gratitude you feel when connecting with someone you love or sharing a meal with your family. Having plenty has little to do with money, and you're deeply attuned to this truth today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
