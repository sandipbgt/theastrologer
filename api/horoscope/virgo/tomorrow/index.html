You're ready to talk with anyone about whatever interesting subjects might come up. The only problem is, conversation may seem dull or repetitive today. You prefer deep analysis. Other people are less interested in picking a subject apart than they are in smooth, balanced interactions. Oh, well. Don't worry; things will get better soon. In the meantime, why not try to enjoy some peaceful discussions with fair-minded people?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
