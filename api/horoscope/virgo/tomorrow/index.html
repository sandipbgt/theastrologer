    "horoscope": "You feel centered today, and it's a great feeling. You're sound of mind and able of body, and everything in your life seems manageable. Sticking to your daily duties might be a waste of this fine energy. You're at the top of your game; why not use some of that precise thinking and determination on your own projects? You can develop your work now or make solid progress, as long as you keep focusing forward.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
