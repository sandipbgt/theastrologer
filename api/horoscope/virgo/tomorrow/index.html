In fact, you should go out of your way to speak kindly and compassionately to them, because they truly want to please you. Focus on cooperation and teamwork. Mention what's good, not what's lacking. See the positive in yourself and others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
