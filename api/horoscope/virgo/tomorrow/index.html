But just because you know what's going on with them, don't interfere. Step aside today. Even if you know what these people are capable of doing, getting involved might just make it worse. Cover your own assets the best you can and leave them to their consequences. This may not be the happiest time, but you can keep it from becoming your worst memory by changing your plans to better absorb the impact.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
