It's just that something big, whether it's a childhood issue or a present day concern, will have your feet to thetoday. Well, that's better than letting the whole thing go to your head, isn't it? Remain upright no matter what. This may not be the most comfortable way to live, but as long as you have to force the situation, you might as well force it in the right direction.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
