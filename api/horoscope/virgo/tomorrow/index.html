    "horoscope": "Your usual logical perspective just doesn't apply today. Life has taken a decidedly emotional turn, and you aren't immune to its effects, as much as you might wish you were. It's best just to sink into this sentimental energy. Instead of trying to adhere to your usual, rigorous schedule, take the time to connect at a feeling level with other people. Access your affectionate, compassionate side. Strengthen your bonds with loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
