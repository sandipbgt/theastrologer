Maybe that's why you're in your version of performance mode, even though normally you might be much more reserved. It just feels good to make someone laugh or tune in with interest with a personal story. Making that connection warms you from the inside out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
