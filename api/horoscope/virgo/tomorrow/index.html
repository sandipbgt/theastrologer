You know you won't stray from the path you know is right. You're too dedicated for that. Treat people with care. Tend to your work. Above all, pay attention to details. You do that naturally, and it will be worth your time. You'll be glad you're particular about the fine points.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
