    "horoscope": "Your attachment to your home base -- friends, family, even your house or apartment itself -- feels deeper today than usual. And there's no better way to demonstrate your soul-deep commitment to these familiar people and places than through selfless service. Caring for an elderly or ill family member is a declaration of love. Cooking dinner for a friend is a gesture of affection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
