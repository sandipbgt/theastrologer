If someone in your life is feeling insecure, you can be their rock -- the strong, steady presence that soothes their nerves and emotions. It brings you a quiet sense of satisfaction to perform this role, because you're genuinely good at it. And it's nice to know you've helped someone feel calmer and more hopeful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
