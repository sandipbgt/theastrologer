    "horoscope": "A sober, hardworking mood sets in today, and you're secretly glad -- or, perhaps not so secretly. The frivolous fun and speculative ventures of the past few days have made you nervous, especially if spending extra money was involved. But now you can revisit your budget and get back on track, and this fills you with a sense of purpose. You're comfortable working within limits you understand, so enjoy it today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
