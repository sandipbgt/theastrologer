Letting your body wander is wonderful now, too, if you can afford the time away from work, responsibilities and your regular life. If you can't take a trip somewhere, take a mental vacation with a good book or a movie. Challenge yourself to think big, unconventional thoughts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
