You're confident enough in yourself to break just about anything down into manageable parts. A logical, step-by-step approach is your strong point, and that's the approach that works best today. Your hard work now will pay you dividends later, too -- you'll see.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
