Either way, you're doing the right thing, because it steers you in the right direction. Of course, reason and rationality come into your decisions, too. It's best if you're moving forward by considering all three. But just for today, if you listen to your heart, you can't possibly go wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
