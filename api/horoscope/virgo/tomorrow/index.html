    "horoscope": "Lots of people are experiencing emotional ups and downs today. But you may actually sense your energy smoothing out. Perhaps this is because you're a calm, rational person by nature. You aren't prone to emotional outbursts, and when a feeling washes through you, you're sensible enough just to let it go. This helps keep your relationships calm, too. Still, you share deep connections with loved ones. Honor those today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
