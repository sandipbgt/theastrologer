    "horoscope": "You're highly responsible, and at the moment, you recognize the need to keep things moving forward at a modest pace. So today, you'll devote yourself to taking time out on a project to regroup and troubleshoot, or simply continuing to put forth your usual effort. If this doesn't sound terribly action-packed, that's because it's not. Right now is all about maintenance, not wild growth or creativity. Anyone who wants cutting-edge excitement will have to look elsewhere.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
