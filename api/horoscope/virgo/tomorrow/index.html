    "horoscope": "Today, your natural flexibility will come in handy. There's a spirited energy at work now. Lots of people are feeling particularly courageous and headstrong, and want to take charge of some project or situation. Thank goodness you're sensible enough to step back and let more aggressive types take the lead! And if you feel they're overlooking details or otherwise skimping on the job, you can help from behind the scenes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
