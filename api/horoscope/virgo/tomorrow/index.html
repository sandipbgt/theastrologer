    "horoscope": "Life gets simple for a few days. It's time to be open and honest -- in short, trustworthy. You can paint a complete picture for people without shading the truth, you know. In fact, right now, it's almost too easy. You can see no reason to complicate issues by beating around the bush. Sometimes, telling 'little white lies' is a necessary part of getting along in this big, chaotic world, but for today, you can do without art or lies. Take a deep breath and enjoy this short period. It's nice when life is uncomplicated, isn't it?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
