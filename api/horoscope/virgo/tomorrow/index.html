    "horoscope": "You're feeling high-strung as you cling hard to your viewpoint, the way a drowning person might cling to a life preserver. But is this really a matter of life and death? If you truly think it is, try a shift in perspective. A one-sided argument may leave you even more unhappy than you're already feeling. Try compromising instead. That will cut through the bad emotions, plus you've put effort into getting along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
