The problem is, they may be right -- you probably aren't being very friendly or helpful. You probably deserve the feedback you're getting, even if it feels like criticism. Don't let this become the start of some long-standing feud. You need your friends, so don't push them away.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
