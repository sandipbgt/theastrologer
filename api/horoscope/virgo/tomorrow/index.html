    "horoscope": "After the fun and laughter of the past couple of days, life's focus shifts once again toward work and responsibilities. Or maybe that's just your personal focus, no matter what you're up to today. You're certainly in logic mode! Even small, mundane jobs or running errands are subjected to your detail-oriented rigor. At least it's kind of fun to be as efficient and yet thorough as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
