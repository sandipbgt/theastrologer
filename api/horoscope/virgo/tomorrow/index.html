    "horoscope": "You're naturally a bit shy, and today you're especially reserved. Making a warm, easy connection with someone may have to wait a few days, but that's okay.

In fact, you might err on the side of being unsympathetic -- another reason to spend time with your own thoughts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
