    "horoscope": "You enjoy cleaning and organizational tasks, because they represent a purging of anything old, broken or obsolete. Today, turn that fix-it energy toward yourself. Interesting emotions are coming up, and if you can train your analytical eye upon them, you stand to learn a great deal about yourself. In just a day or two, you may be a different -- and better -- version of the person than you were before.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
