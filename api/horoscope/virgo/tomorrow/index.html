Your responsibilities may be heavy, but you know you can handle them. That's a good feeling. It increases your self-confidence and inner serenity. And when you cross that last item off your task list, you feel a real sense of accomplishment. You made it happen!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
