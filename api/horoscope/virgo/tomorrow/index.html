    "horoscope": "A calm, grounded mood descends -- perfect for tackling the rigors of your work or chores around the house. Whatever happens to be on your to-do list, you can handle it easily. You'll even enjoy putting in several hours of focused effort toward a particular goal, and your sense of accomplishment is strong when you're able to cross the next item off your list. Make time for some fun and relaxation, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
