    "horoscope": "It's time to set aside that disciplined work ethic of yours and connect with good friends and family. Today's a day to extend your warmth and generosity toward other people, or, if you're on your own, toward yourself. Indulge any food cravings you may have -- within reason, of course! -- and set comfort as a priority. A dinner party is a great use of the current energy, because it combines nurturing with good company.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
