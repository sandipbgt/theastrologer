    "horoscope": "You're focused on your responsibilities toward your family or your career today. This shouldn't feel like a heavy weight, even if you have hard work ahead of you. It actually feels good to live up to expectations and fulfill your duties -- like a solid workout for your soul. And you don't even need thanks or recognition for your contribution. It just feels good knowing you've made a positive difference in someone's life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
