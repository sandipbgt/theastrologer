    "horoscope": "Personal connections take center stage today. You crave emotional intimacy and affection. It's a good day for one-on-one time with your sweetheart or a heart-to-heart talk with a friend or relative. There's a sense of raw emotional honesty as you bare your soul to one another. That might sound intense, and it is! But it's a good kind of intensity that brings you closer to the people you love.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
