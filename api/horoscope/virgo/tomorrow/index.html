    "horoscope": "If you have a reputation as a perfectionist, it's probably due to days like today, when your analytical mind is especially keen. You won't let a single detail slip by you. That outlook would drive some people crazy. In your case, it's just how you are -- logical, focused and with high expectations. Still, keep a sense of practicality about you. That way, you can set your standards to a high yet reasonable limit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
