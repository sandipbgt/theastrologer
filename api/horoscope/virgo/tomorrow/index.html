But today, you're grounded in what's truly important -- time spent with the people or pets you care about, or working on a project you find personally meaningful. Your energy is balanced, which means you can throw yourself into your work without worry that you'll overdo it. The same goes for rest and relaxation. Enjoy yourself today!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
