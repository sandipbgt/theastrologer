    "horoscope": "A brand-new personal cycle begins for you today. You're focused and centered, and in the mood for careful detail work. Just don't spend too much time on the minor stuff. There's a fine line between being thorough and being a perfectionist. Do your best to err on the side of the former! Otherwise, you're just spinning your wheels and wasting time. And inefficient actions offend your streamlined soul, dear Virgo.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
