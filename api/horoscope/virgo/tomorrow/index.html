    "horoscope": "A sense of inner serenity settles over you today. You're extra dependable under the current influence, and you know it. You take a sense of pride in the fact that other people rely on you, and for good reason. No challenge is too complicated for you, because you're such a master at breaking things down into smaller, more manageable parts.
