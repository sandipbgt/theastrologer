It's important to let others know you're sincere about getting along. If you're trying to work on a project or negotiate an agreement with someone, it's best to be as cooperative as you can. Give the other side some of what they want, so that you'll get more of what you want.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
