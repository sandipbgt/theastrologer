You can get a lot accomplished in these personal realms, especially if you stay on task. Here's a prediction: In just a day or two, your house will be cleaner, you'll have reached out to a loved one over the phone or in person, and you'll be feeling pretty good about your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
