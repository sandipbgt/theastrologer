    "horoscope": "Turn your discerning eye toward your home today. Get down-and-dirty about cleaning and making things more comfortable for yourself and your family. Wash the sheets and towels, scrub the floors and baseboards, dust the blinds and polish the windows. But don't spend the entire day doing (or supervising!) these tasks. Reserve some time in the evening to sit and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with all your hard work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
