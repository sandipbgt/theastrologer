    "horoscope": "Yesterday's pokey, unfocused feeling continues today. When you try to focus on a project, your mind wanders, and worries or daydreams crowd in. Today is better spent napping, reading or hanging out with your family than trying to do anything more rigorous or demanding. You're likely to miss important details in anything you try to accomplish. You can get back to work tomorrow, Virgo. Permit yourself to take it easy today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
