    "horoscope": "Let your feelings wash through you today. You're in such an emotional state that you might resist their pull; they could get in the way of your work, for example, or keep you from focusing on your responsibilities. But that's not such a bad thing, is it? Sometimes your responsibility is toward yourself and your own, inner well-being. Take a little me-time today, and be gentle with yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
