    "horoscope": "Seek balance today, in any part of your life in which that applies. This might mean eating healthy, wholesome meals, or creating balance in your home or work space by clearing up clutter. But balance in relationships is most important now. Do your best to get along with neighbors and coworkers. Even if you see problems in someone's work or attitude, resist the urge to criticize! Offer encouragement and goodwill instead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
