Whatever passes through you, it might leave you feeling driven to cleanse the world of sin. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you call sin and how you decide to go after it. But remember, when you're playing with, there's nothing cute about being clumsy. Be mindful about what matters deeply to other people, too. Nobody here wants a holy war. If you can all agree, maybe you'll all get somewhere today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
