It's perfectly fine to reserve judgment for another day, so you can investigate things a little further. There's still plenty under the surface that you don't know about yet, and you can learn a lot through some simple sleuthing and fact-finding. In fact, this could turn into a fun project today. Don't be afraid to lose yourself in the joy of discovery.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
