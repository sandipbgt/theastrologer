    "horoscope": "Watch and listen carefully. Create the quiet conditions and natural lighting you need. Don't like what your noisy neighbors are up to? Spread civilization by acting civilized. They might laugh at first, but they'll change their tune once they hear all the cool stuff coming from your house. Today you'll work for harmony because you love the sound of it. But remember, you can't maintain this purity forever. You can let a little friendly noise creep back in once you're clear that everyone is getting along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
