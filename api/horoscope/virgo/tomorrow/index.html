    "horoscope": "Today, you'll have to take direct action on something new. You're more than up to the task, and it'll give you a chance to show everyone what you can do. Take this golden opportunity to repair your environment as you soothe your conscience. Maybe this is work you should have done ages ago. If so, there's no need for regrets. You're moving forward from here, and you're doing a great job.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
