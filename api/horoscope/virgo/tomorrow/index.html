    "horoscope": "Your heart and your mind are working together today. Logic still counts for a lot, but your instincts are humming, too. And the information they send you is accurate. Use it to help someone near you who is in need. You can sense others' emotional pain, and respond to it with genuine sympathy. It's so important to have someone to lean on when life gets tough. They'll appreciate your strength and loyalty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
