    "horoscope": "Managers and directors shine today. If you're in a leadership position, you'll find it easy to keep your team focused on the task at hand. You're certain of what you're working toward and you know the right way to get there. And if you're working on your own, so much the better. After all, you're an old hand at making someone else's business run smoothly. Now, it's time to outline and pursue your own goals. You can make great strides now toward your personal version of success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
