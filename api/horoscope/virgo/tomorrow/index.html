You might even find ways to streamline processes that have already been established. There's nothing wrong with cutting corners, as long as the end result is of high quality. And you wouldn't settle for anything less, Virgo! This is the kind of day when you're sure to impress anyone who's tracking your progress.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
