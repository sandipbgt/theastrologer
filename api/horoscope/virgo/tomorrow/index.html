    "horoscope": "You're unusually sensitive today. Your own emotions may be more tender than usual, or you might be able to read other people's feelings with ease. It's important to be especially gentle with people under the current influence, since many folks are feeling a little on the fragile side. Be conscious in projecting warmth and concern, even if you privately believe that someone is being overindulgent with their emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
