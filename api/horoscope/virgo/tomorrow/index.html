    "horoscope": "Watch that perfectionist streak of yours today. It could push you to be overly critical of other people and their behavior. It could also have you holding yourself to impossible standards. That can only lead to disappointment in yourself when you realize you've fallen short of your own expectations. And just think how someone close to you feels when they realize you're dissatisfied with them! Making your standards more realistic helps everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
