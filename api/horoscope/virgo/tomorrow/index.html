    "horoscope": "It's a good day to carry on some tradition of caring that has been passed down to you from someone you love. Pull out an old family cookbook and making a meal for your own loved ones, or tell your children stories about their grandparents. Pore over old family photos or genealogy information, and remember the people who have gone before you. This is enjoyable, even if it brings tears to your eyes!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
