It doesn't hurt that other people, such as your colleagues or clients, can see how efficiently you work and how diligently you apply yourself to your task list. It's okay to indulge in a little self-pride today,. Pat yourself on the back, or even treat yourself to a nice -- but modest -- reward. Then get back down to business.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
