    "horoscope": "In certain situations, your ability to focus in a deep, extreme way is a real asset. Among other things, that talent makes you a passionate and exciting partner in an intimate relationship. Similarly, career-wise, you can get a lot accomplished when you set your mind on a goal. But today you may be obsessed with just one thing, and it probably won't benefit from such compulsive fixation. Do your best to stay versatile.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
