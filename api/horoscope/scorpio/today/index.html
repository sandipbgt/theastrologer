    "horoscope": "Looking deeply into your feelings, your relationships and life itself comes naturally to you. But today, try not to be quite so analytical. Accept life as it comes, and people, too. Take pleasure in simple, basic experiences, such as the sweetness of a good piece of fruit or the luxury of a long, hot shower. It may sound silly,, but these little moments make up your life. Appreciate them today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
