    "horoscope": "Being hardheaded is one thing, but this stubbornness is another. When issues come up today, don't be afraid to surrender or even apologize. Despite what you may think, this won't kill you. In the end, it could actually make you stronger, because you'll realize that giving a little ground to someone else isn't the end of the world. Everyone has their own view of things. Sometimes, lessons in humility are a good and necessary thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
