    "horoscope": "It's a good day to go out for exotic food or a foreign film. Expose yourself to something you've never experienced before, and challenge yourself to stay open-minded instead of slipping into judgment mode. Life is so much more interesting when you can appreciate all sorts of people, experiences, sounds and tastes, isn't it,? And you have a natural taste for anything exotic. Indulge that part of yourself today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
