    "horoscope": "Instead of avoiding things you don't understand, your instincts urge you to dig deeper -- sometimes to a fault. Not every secret wants to be revealed. But soon you'll have a unique chance to penetrate deep mysteries and create beauty from chaos --  two of your favorite kinds of puzzles. Best of all, any challenges you'll encounter will be welcome ones. Open your arms and your heart --you're in for a short but very interesting ride.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
