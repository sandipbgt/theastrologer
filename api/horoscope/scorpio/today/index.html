    "horoscope": "It's important to create harmony in your close relationships today. Do your best to get along, and avoid insisting on having things your way. Being stubborn would be a mistake, since it would send the other person a clear message that you aren't willing to compromise. And that likely isn't the case. You don't mind giving a little in order to get a little in return. That's what the art of negotiation is all about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
