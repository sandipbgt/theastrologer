    "horoscope": "It's a good day to lose yourself in work, especially a research project or a creative endeavor. You're able to reach a deep level of concentration. And this is so much more productive than obsessing over your problems. It's easy now to get sucked into hurt feelings or romantic drama. But it's so much better to maintain a positive attitude. Resist the urge to get involved in interpersonal theatrics.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
