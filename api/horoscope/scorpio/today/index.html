    "horoscope": "A sense of belonging makes you feel calm and settled. Your ties with loved ones seem stronger today, as does your sense of self. You know where you stand in the world, even if it's just for today. You can make use of this brief lull in the craziness of daily life by choosing your next few steps with care. Whatever you're working on, whether it's a personal or professional project, you'll face it with courage.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
