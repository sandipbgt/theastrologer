    "horoscope": "It's not like you to waver under the pressure of a firm decision. No one expects you to be oversensitive when your skin is normally so thick. But you have a heart, too. You have silly whims and make unreasonable choices. This is who you are today, who you've been in the past, and who you could be in the future. All people move through changes like this, sometimes without warning. So accept uncertainty as a fact of life. Nobody knows everything, and if you think about it, nobody would want to know it all. Wouldn't that get boring?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
