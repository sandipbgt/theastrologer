You tend to be naturally fascinated by things other people might find unconventional or even taboo. This is part of being the true individual that you are, and it's great as long as you're genuinely interested. Of course, going for shock value is fun, too -- as long as you choose your moment and audience carefully.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
