    "horoscope": "With your high energy and such a strong vision of what you want, it'll be hard to take a measured approach today. After all, you're used to pursuing your desires and ambitions with single-minded intensity. The problem is, at the moment, your center is off. A good strategy for this period is to lower your aim. That way, you won't be disappointed byto your ideas or obstacles cropping up at every turn. Also, forgive others freely for standing in your way. Then they'll forgive you. It's all part of growing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
