    "horoscope": "Passion is your guiding force today, so channel it as consciously as you can. Otherwise, you might veer toward becoming passionately upset. Better to be passionately affectionate, creative or any of the other more positive expressions of this energy! Your stubborn streak is stimulated now. This raises that potential for ego clashes and battles of will. But tapping into the fun side of the current influence unlocks so many great possibilities!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
