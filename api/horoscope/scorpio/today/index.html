Your mind is attuned to data trends and anomalies now, so you're sure to spot anything interesting as you make your analysis. Just be sure you don't let your own preconceptions get in the way of learning something new. Stubborn, contrary behavior can be an issue now, and can inhibit true learning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
