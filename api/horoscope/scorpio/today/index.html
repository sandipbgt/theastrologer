Of course, you have a strong personality, so it may be wise to be conscious in creating a give and take in any interaction. Offer your opinions, but make space for others' as well -- even if you strongly disagree with them. Challenge yourself to embrace and encourage true diversity of thought.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
