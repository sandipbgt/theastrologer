This is one trait you know how to use to your advantage. You're passionate about your reasons for wanting to direct the crowd, and woe to anyone who contradicts you. Let them try -- they'll see how far they get! You're earned everyone's loyalty, which proves you know best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
