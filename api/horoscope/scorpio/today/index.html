There's no hidden agenda here -- you simply want to get along with the people in your day-to-day life, because it's so much more pleasant that way. People may be surprised to find you so agreeable, since you're often pushing for what you want, whether in a subtle or overt way. But now, you're willing to give some ground in order to achieve harmony.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
