Maybe you're afraid of giving all your secrets away. And if others won't follow your lead, you're perfectly willing to go it alone. Except team efforts are favored now. Go ahead and disclose your genius ideas. Do it for the good of the group.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
