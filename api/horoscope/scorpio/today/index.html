You know what each situation requires of you, which makes it easy to respond appropriately, even when problems arise. You could be the cool head in a crisis, or the voice of compassion in an issue that centers on logic. It's this blending of heart and mind that comes so in handy today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
