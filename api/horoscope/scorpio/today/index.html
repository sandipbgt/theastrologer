    "horoscope": "Today, your mantra should be 'stay mellow.' There's a wonderfully grounded energy at work right now, so staying levelheaded shouldn't be too difficult. On the other hand, your stubborn streak is highlighted, which makes it tough to keep calm if you start getting worked up about something. When you find yourself feeling annoyed or put out, take a few deep breaths, and repeat your mantra to get back on an even keel.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
