You're a master of brilliant disguise, superb at appearing gracious and cool even when you're seething inside. In fact, you're doing it right now! But be strong. Wear your company manners for another day. Be attentive and understanding toward others. This little sacrifice will actually help you in the long run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
