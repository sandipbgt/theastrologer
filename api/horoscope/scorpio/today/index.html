    "horoscope": "Being sensible isn't difficult today. You have an eye for what works and what doesn't. If you interact with someone who's being unreasonable, you can calmly counter their illogical ideas with your own feasible plans. Because of this skill, you make a good manager now. If you're in charge of a group of people, expect to put out some minor fires. And you'll actually enjoy this! It's nice to feel competent and in control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
