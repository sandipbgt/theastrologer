Yes, events will keep driving you forward. First comes the stick, and then comes the carrot. That's just how it is this time around, but at least your valiant efforts will be rewarded soon. And don't sweat the expectations of people who might be confusing you with the superhero they ordered up from central casting. It's worth remembering that you really can perform on demand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
