    "horoscope": "Today, let all pretenses and manipulations fall away. Whatever personal agenda you may have seems unimportant in the face of your urge to connect with others in a simple, heartfelt way. It's also easier to resolve tensions.

That's how true healing and growth begin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
