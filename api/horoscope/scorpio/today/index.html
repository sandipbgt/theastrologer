Still, isn't it better to move forward than to retain an old, outmoded way of living? Today is the perfect time to think about how you really want to live. Since you'll be more comfortable if you have some control over things, put your considerable energy into determining where in your life change is needed, so you can make it happen when the time is right.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
