    "horoscope": "Today you might feel swamped with nostalgia. Your dreams could be vividly emotional, and when you wake up, you're still steeped in that feeling. Isn't it nice to revisit the past? Even bittersweet memories are pleasurable in the way they tug on your heartstrings. You're in your element -- the realm of pure feeling -- and this is where you're most comfortable. If you connect with someone, it's sure to be on an emotional level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
