    "horoscope": "Be aboveboard today as you deal with other people, and keep an open mind and an optimistic heart. The more enthusiasm you can muster up for your projects and interactions, the better they'll go. There's a direct correlation between the positive energy you put into something and the satisfaction you derive from it. So put your best face forward, and don't worry so much. Just assume that things will work out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
