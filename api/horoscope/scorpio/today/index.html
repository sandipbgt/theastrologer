    "horoscope": "'Change' could be your middle name. You often look inward, trying to understand yourself better. The psychology of other people comes easily to you, too. But today, your perceptions are different than others'. Don't let a couple of communication breakdowns get under your skin. They provide a much-needed lesson in humility, as well as in staying calm in the face of frustration. Have a heart, and ground yourself in reality. This could turn out to be your source of strength and your impetus for change.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
