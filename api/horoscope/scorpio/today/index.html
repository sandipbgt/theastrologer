    "horoscope": "Today you're quite sensitive to others' needs and emotions. This is a good thing, because right now, other people are just plain sensitive! They could really use the type of support and compassionate advice that you can provide. Best of all, you don't even need to be told how others are feeling. If someone close to you is worried or upset, you can sense it almost as strongly as if you feel it, yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
