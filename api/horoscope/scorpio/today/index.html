    "horoscope": "You're extra emotional today. Things may seem like a bigger deal than they really are. You might even  have the insight to know that you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It could still be difficult to talk yourself down. Reason and logic just aren't part of the current influence. This applies to other people, too. If you accidentally hurt someone's feelings, don't try to explain what you meant. Just apologize.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
