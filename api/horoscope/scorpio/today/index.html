    "horoscope": "You can't stand artificial chatter. And inane social pleasantries make your skin crawl! But today, a grin-and-bear-it approach is best. Your agenda is full, and everywhere you go, you encounter someone in the mood for chitchat. Maybe the conversation will turn out to be interesting. You'll never know unless you give it a chance. So open your mind and pretend interest, if you have to. You might be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
