    "horoscope": "You feel energized and optimistic today -- a welcome break from your usual, more serious outlook. Your companions today appreciate your uplifted mood, too. It creates a much more positive atmosphere when you concentrate on what's good instead of any problems or concerns you may have. Your usual tactic of focusing on others and not revealing much about yourself could really work for you today,. Keep the gathering upbeat and happy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
