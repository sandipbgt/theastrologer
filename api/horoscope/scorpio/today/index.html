Or perhaps you'll encounter a concept in an article or somewhere else that surprises you in its unconventionality. It's great to gain a new perspective on the world. Even if you're just courting difference for its own sake, at least you're stepping outside the box and giving your assumptions the boot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
