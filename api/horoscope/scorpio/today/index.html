    "horoscope": "If you're in a leadership position today, you might be overly controlling, and your team is feeling resentful. Of course, if you're supposed to be following someone else's lead, you're probably feeling rebellious, to say the least. Can't you just try to get along? There's no need for all this pushing and pulling. This is one of those days when trying to take control of a project or a group won't work out for you or anyone else involved. You're better off being cooperative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
