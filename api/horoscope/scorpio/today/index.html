    "horoscope": "Emotional intensity is the theme for today. You actually enjoy this kind of energy. It focuses you, even if you have difficult experiences.

That enables you to bypass the battles of will that are so common under the current energy, and get straight to the heart of the matter: the need to connect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
