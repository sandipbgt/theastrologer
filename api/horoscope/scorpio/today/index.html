    "horoscope": "It's a good day to charm someone. Whereas sometimes you like to push the envelope with other people, now you're conscious of the need to get along. You're extra reasonable, and folks can sense your willingness to collaborate. You don't need to feel in control of a situation. It's more important to feel that you're in it with someone else, and that you can rely on each other if the going gets tough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
