    "horoscope": "Tap into today's placid energy and use it to relax. Life has been hectic for the past couple of days! This is your chance for some downtime. There's a lot of pleasure to be found in the physical, sensual world. Flavors and textures are more noticeable. Eat foods you enjoy and hug the people you love. Enjoy the weather, even if it's dreary outside. The natural world has so much to offer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
