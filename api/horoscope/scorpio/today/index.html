    "horoscope": "You're in your element today. Your feelings run strong, deep and true, and your intuition is especially pronounced. If you have psychic tendencies, they're powerful now. But even a heightened sense of emotion can help you connect with yourself, other people, and whatever you hold sacred. This is the kind of day when you might be overcome with an intense sense of thankfulness for all your experiences, both positive and painful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
