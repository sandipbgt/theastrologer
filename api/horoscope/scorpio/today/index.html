    "horoscope": "It's hard not to want to take charge in some way today. Your energy is high, your vision is clear, and your sense of initiative is strong. You want to put all that fine determination to good use! But now it's more important than ever to do what it takes to get along with others. Avoid stubbornness in group settings, especially professional situations, or ones in which you want to make a positive impression.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
