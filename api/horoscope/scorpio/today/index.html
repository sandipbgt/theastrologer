    "horoscope": "Are you ready to go for it? Make peace with your past, and throw yourself into the moment. Your big ambitions will have more of a chance when your record is clear. Come clean with any dirty laundry before someone else tries to hang it off the balcony. You never know who your challengers might be, so you might as well disarm them before they come at you. Whether you're running for public office, interviewing for jobs, hosting your in-laws or looking for someone to share your time, a day of honesty can only help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
