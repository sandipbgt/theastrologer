    "horoscope": "Life could get a little intense today. Your emotions are deep and strong, which could be a good thing or a challenging one. If you're currently in a place of love and inner strength, this should be a day of rejoicing deeply in the gifts your life has brought you. But if difficult situations spark feelings of jealousy or irritation, confrontations could arise. If so, watch how you express yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
