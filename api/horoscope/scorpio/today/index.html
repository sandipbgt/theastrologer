You're rarely one to shy away from honesty -- except, of course, when it comes to the evasions you use to keep deeply personal information about yourself hidden from prying eyes. But now, it's important to talk openly even about those private truths. There's something you want to get off your chest, and the right people are listening. Gather your audience and say your piece.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
