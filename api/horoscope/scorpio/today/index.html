    "horoscope": "Today, the pace of life moves along more slowly than usual. And that's just fine with you. Your own energy isn't particularly high, though you probably don't feel drained. In fact, you feel emotionally centered. Your personal core of strength -- that feeling part of your soul -- is empowered by the current influence. You're compassionate and big-hearted, and you're putting out wonderfully positive energy into the universe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
