    "horoscope": "Understanding human psychology is one of your greatest strengths and your best characteristics. And today, it's at the forefront of your experience. You want to hear people's stories of hardship, and not just because you find human nature interesting. You genuinely empathize with their difficult feelings and tough times. You may get a chance to offer someone good advice today. At the very least, you can offer them an attentive ear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
