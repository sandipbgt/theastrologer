    "horoscope": "Today is your favorite kind of day -- interesting, intense and full of emotional upheaval. There's such release in facing a problem or inspecting your feelings at a deep, uncomfortable level. Just make sure you aren't creating a problem purely for that rush of feeling. It's wonderful to work through issues, and the current influence certainly supports that. But if life is light and easy right now, don't make it harder or darker!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
