    "horoscope": "Your motives are deep and your convictions pure, and today, that's all that matters. You're in your own head, separate from the rest of the world as you work through something complex and complicated -- your favorite kind of problem. In fact, this isn't so much a problem as an interesting diversion, one that takes you away to that special place you love so well: that place of solitude and profound thought, of intense pondering and intimate connection with your own soul. You'll rejoin the world tomorrow, when your energy turns outward again. For now, explore your own psyche.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
