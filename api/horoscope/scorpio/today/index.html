After all, your delivery could use a little work, and today's perfect for practicing. Later, you could find yourself a little closer to perfect, and all the effort and uneasy feelings will seem worth it. Of course, don't discount luck. That plays a part, too. Give up your illusions of control and use the Force, Luke.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
