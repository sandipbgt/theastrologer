    "horoscope": "Suddenly, you're thrust into the role of therapist or confidant for all your friends. Even perfect strangers may seem drawn to your obvious intelligence and keen eye for the motivations behind people's behavior. And the truth is, you like filling this role. There's little that you find more interesting than human nature. And helping your friends through rough spots in their lives is one of the best, most positive uses of your personal talents.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
