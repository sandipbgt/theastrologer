    "horoscope": "You're highly sensitive today to the influences around you. If a friend or coworker is anxious, for example, you might absorb their stress and feel it within yourself. The good thing is, you're strong enough to protect yourself against over-identifying with others' emotions. Being able to set and maintain boundaries helps you create the right balance of empathy and distance. You can help others without getting enmeshed in their problems.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
