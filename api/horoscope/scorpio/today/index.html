    "horoscope": "Today, your motto should be 'Free your mind.' Once you do that, your heart is sure to follow. And there's such a beautifully expansive energy to tap into now! The world looks bright and shiny from your vantage point. You feel the urge to explore. Follow that desire where it leads you. And don't look too deeply into your experiences -- not yet. Sometimes, the important thing is just to have them. You can process them later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
