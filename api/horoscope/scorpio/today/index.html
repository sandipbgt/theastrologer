    "horoscope": "You're not used to this kind of amped-up, bubbly energy, are you? No, you're used to feeling calm, centered, and in control. But maybe this is a good test. After all, your delivery could use a little work, and today's perfect for practicing. Later, you could find yourself a little closer to perfect, and all the effort and uneasy feelings will seem worth it. Of course, don't discount luck. That plays a part, too. Give up your illusions of control and use the Force, Luke.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
