    "horoscope": "You're security-minded by nature, and today peace of mind comes from focus and work. Take your tasks seriously, even if they're minor or tedious. A concentrated effort yields great results now, and a serious outlook is favored. This shouldn't be difficult to live up to, since currently you're more analytical than usual. Given your love of uncovering what was previously hidden, you could get quite absorbed in some pursuit today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
