Perhaps some opportunity arises unexpectedly, prompting you to consider heading down a completely different path than the one you've been on. Or maybe this won't happen on such a grand scale: Maybe you'll simply have a conversation that inspires you to consider something in a new and different light. Either way, the experience will enrich you as much as you'll allow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
