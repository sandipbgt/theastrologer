    "horoscope": "When you're in the company of other people today, calmness and politeness count for a lot. The impression you make matters now, even if you're with folks who know you well. Show them you're making the effort to treat them with respect and get along. They'll go out of their way to do the same. At that point, just about anything is possible! You only have to be creative in envisioning your goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
