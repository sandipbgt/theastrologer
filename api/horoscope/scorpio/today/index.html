    "horoscope": "Get out of the realm of your mind and into your body today. Ground yourself in physical pleasures like good foods, endurance-based exercise and hugs shared with your children or pets. Above all, stay mellow. If you get into a disagreement, your stubborn streak could flare up. Just remember, people don't usually respond well to it. When you're flexible and easygoing, you're much more likely to get what you want.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
