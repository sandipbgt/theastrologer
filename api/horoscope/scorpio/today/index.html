As with any burst of self-direction, it's important to think about how you plan to channel this. Though you're in a take-charge mood, you don't need to dominate everyone around you. Think of how to put your personal power to use in a way that will benefit everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
