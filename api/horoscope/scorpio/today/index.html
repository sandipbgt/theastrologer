    "horoscope": "Your focus shifts today to your immediate environment: your home and loved ones, or the people and places most familiar to you. You're feeling strong, emotionally centered and unusually compassionate. This makes you well positioned to help someone else who isn't feeling quite as strong. You're a great listener, and you can offer them thoughtful advice to help them resolve an issue. Helping people makes you feel good about yourself, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
