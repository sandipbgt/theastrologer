    "horoscope": "You enjoy taking control in your relationships, even if you do so in a subtle, behind-the-scenes way. Today, though, make a point of sharing the power with the other person.

These small gestures will show how sincere you are in creating a balanced relationship.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
