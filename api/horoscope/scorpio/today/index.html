    "horoscope": "A snooty attitude won't fly with your friends or sweetheart. If you're sensing some resistance coming your way, try backing off and working with what you actually know. People will appreciate your humility, and their kinder attitudes will help you get in a better mood faster. If all of that just seems impossible now, spend some time alone, or sweat out your frustrations at the gym. This tense spot shouldn't last long.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
