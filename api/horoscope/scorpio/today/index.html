You're usually the one that's got a sharp, clear vision in mind. You normally know exactly what you want to happen, and exactly how you intend to orchestrate it. Still, don't throw your weight around just to have a voice in this endeavor. Instead, yield to the dominant plan. Even if it's not exactly what you had in mind, chances are you'll learn to like it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
