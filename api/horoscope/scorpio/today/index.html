Even a friendly argument with someone could have been fun -- but instead, you're on your own. Remember, lots of good work and plenty of fun pranks are still possible. You're feeling both focused and mischievous, so decide which quality you feel like favoring.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
