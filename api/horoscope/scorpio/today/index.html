What's more, you see little reason to hold yourself back from speaking your mind. Other people are similarly bold or even aggressive now. What does all this add up to? For one thing, it means there's great potential for run-ins with folks who try your patience. Do your best not to be insensitive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
