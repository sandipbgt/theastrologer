    "horoscope": "Today, you're just going through the motions. Normally you're incredibly passionate, but right now your heart isn't in it. Do you lack trust for someone? If so, you really need to talk it out with them instead of letting these bad feelings simmer. If you bottle them up, you know they'll only increase to boiling point. If it's a simple lack of energy that's holding you back, take a walk or a quick nap to rejuvenate yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
