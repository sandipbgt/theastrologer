    "horoscope": "Your friends and allies are worth their weight in gold today, so treat them accordingly. One thing you can offer in return is your own allegiance, and that's of no small value. You're a strong teammate and warrior, and enemies can't hope to penetrate the wall you're able to erect. Of course, you don't have many enemies, so all should be well. You have the element of surprise working for you now, which you can use to your advantage. You'll wow everyone and leave them wondering what just happened while you pull way ahead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
