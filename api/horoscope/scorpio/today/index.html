    "horoscope": "Your friends or family may need your compassion today. And you're in a wonderful position to offer gentle advice or support. Where the current influence has others feeling emotionally sensitive, you're in your element -- stable and serene, whatever your mood. Put some loving, healing energy out into the world, especially for the benefit of the people with whom you're closest. Feeling this needed is a good thing!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
