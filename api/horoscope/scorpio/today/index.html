    "horoscope": "A sense of calm originates from some deep place within you today. You're focused on a goal. You know instinctively that you can reach it by using your energy in careful, measured steps. This isn't about fighting for what you want, or reaching it through a leap of faith. It's about being practical and staying grounded as you work toward a measurable outcome. You can do this, and you know that with your entire being.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
