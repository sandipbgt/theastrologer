This is why today is perfect for submerging yourself in these internal comforts. Your inner strength is building, and you can draw deeply from it if and when you need to. Just don't forget that your gifts to the world are many. Even if you feel like withdrawing from the hubbub, you can still afford to be generous.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
