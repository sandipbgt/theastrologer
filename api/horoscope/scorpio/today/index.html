You possess considerable depths, yourself, though they might be hidden to most of the world. Someone's bold, brash mannerisms might really rub you the wrong way, and arrogance will really set you off! But why not just let them have their fun? Maybe they're feeling a little insecure, and they need the attention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
