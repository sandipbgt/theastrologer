    "horoscope": "Your mood turns selfless and generous today. You're emotionally centered enough to set your own needs aside for the sake of tending to someone else. You can give a lot of love now, or good advice or support, or whatever might be needed. This is partly due to the fact that you're so attuned to the people around you right now. If they're in pain, you feel it as if it's your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
