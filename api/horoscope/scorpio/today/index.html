    "horoscope": "Your mind is preoccupied with strange and interesting subjects today. In fact, you might currently be attracted to oddities just because they're odd. This is fine, but don't take any unnecessary risks! Sometimes you delve into neighborhoods or areas of study that hold great interest for you, but you don't have enough regard for your own personal safety. Look out for yourself. Be practical as you pursue your interests.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
