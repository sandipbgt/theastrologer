    "horoscope": "No matter how much someone at work or at home has hurt your feelings today, you need to set aside your small grievances. Take a look at the large-scale plan.

Today, choose your battles well. What's your purpose here? Take your time in answering that one, so you can draw the right conclusion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
