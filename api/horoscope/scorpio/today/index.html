    "horoscope": "Don't start anything new today. Instead, use all that creativity that's coursing through your veins to finish something. You can get some incredible preparation done now. You'll surprise even yourself with the richness of ideas that come your way. Be sure to focus on an existing project or relationship rather than starting fresh. And be patient with anyone who tries to drag you off in a new direction. They may not understand that, for you, completing something is the only way to go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
