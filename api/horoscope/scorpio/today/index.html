    "horoscope": "Everyone around you seems bent on small talk today. You want to talk, too, and trade ideas, but mindless chatter annoys you to no end. It's a good day for a deep, heart-to-heart talk with a trusted friend, or a session with your counselor. You're making quick intellectual connections, and you could end up discovering something very interesting about yourself. Talk it out,. Don't keep secrets today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
