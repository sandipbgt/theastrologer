    "horoscope": "Caution and self-restraint count for a lot today. And together, they amount to wisdom. You can't be taken in by any salesman or huckster. No one will mislead you, at least not through misunderstanding or failure to read the small print. Perhaps even more importantly, you won't mislead yourself. It's easy to avoid unnecessary purchases and other indulgences now. You're just too practical to crave anything you don't truly need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
