There's still time to do something about that. Cut a bloated budget down to size today. Turn those vindictive urges into creative tension as you sketch out your wicked ideas instead of actually drawing blood. Find the goodness even in bad things. And don't be sneering at that thought. It's not as lame as it sounds.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
