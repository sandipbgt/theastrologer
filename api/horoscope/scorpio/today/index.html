    "horoscope": "Your heart is especially soft today, so surround yourself with people you trust. But even if you're among strangers, you have a way of seeing through the surface to the good stuff inside. You understand people even better today than usual, which is a lot! You're at your best when you're this compassionate and tuned in to other people. Use your gift to help someone who could use your understanding or advice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
