    "horoscope": "Today you're capable of tremendous focus, which you can put toward any subject or endeavor. But certain areas of life call your attention more than others now. Finances, including savings and investment strategies, may be especially engrossing now. Your work is also a high priority at the moment. You can really get absorbed in serious matters, even ones you might normally avoid because they're just too heavy or tedious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
