Suddenly, your usual experiences seem a little dull. If you're craving something new, just make some small change to your routine. Strike up a conversation with someone you don't normally speak to, or research a trip to someplace you've never been before. Embrace the world of possibility.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
