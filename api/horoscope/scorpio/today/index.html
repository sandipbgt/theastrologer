It's a smart idea to get some extra sleep, or at the very least, take a few quiet moments here and there throughout the day to recharge. This will also help with dealing with other people -- everyone who isn't feeling quite as inwardly smooth as you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
