    "horoscope": "You can have a calming effect on others today, because you're feeling so emotionally centered yourself. This is a great skill and gift now, when many people around you might be feeling melancholy or insecure. Bolster their spirits with kind words, a smile or a warm hug. This is the nurturing side of your personality coming out. It feels good to express such caring for others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
