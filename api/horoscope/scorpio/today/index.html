    "horoscope": "Today you're concerned with a stable future. Your thoughts turn toward upgrading your house or car, or moving up a rung on your career ladder. It's a great day for making plans related to these areas, because you're practical yet ambitious. You'll aim high, but not so high that you set unattainable goals. This balanced view of your life and abilities really helps in moving onward and upward.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
