That's to be avoided now. Looking outside the box is favored. You'll find great rewards in breaking out of your own assumptions. Remember, if this process makes you uncomfortable, that's a good thing. It means you're learning something new.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
