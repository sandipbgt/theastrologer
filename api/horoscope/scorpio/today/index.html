    "horoscope": "You have a lot of untapped potential, and you know it. it's a sort of latent energy, an awareness of your own power that you might someday tap into. The fact that this exists within you both fascinates and frightens you. But the sooner you start using it, the sooner you'll become the person you're meant to be -- the person you are on the inside. Maybe some outside perspective could help you access this personal power.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
