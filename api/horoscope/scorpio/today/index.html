    "horoscope": "It feels good to put in hard effort on a project or long hours at the office today. Your energy is steady, and you're capable of accomplishing a lot. Making money is especially satisfying now, because it brings a sense of stability. In fact, if any area of your finances is on shaky ground, it's a very good day for sitting down and making a practical plan for the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
