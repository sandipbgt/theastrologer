    "horoscope": "Ordinarily, your instincts might tell you to hang back and observe rather than making your agenda plain to everyone, but now it's time to be open and expressive, and to get involved. There's a project in the works, or maybe a new relationship, and there's no reason for you to be cagey. You're still everyone's favorite person, which means they'll help you make things happen. Take advantage of this unique opportunity, because it doesn't come around that often.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
