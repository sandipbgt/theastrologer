In this case, do what you're so good at: Create the space this new part of you needs to grow. Keep it private and nurture it in silence, until it's ready to come out. You'll let other people know about it in good time -- if they need to know, that is.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
