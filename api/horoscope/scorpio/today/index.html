    "horoscope": "Make a real effort not to be self-centered today. It's not that this is so difficult for you: You're always aware of other people's needs. But today it's especially important to support the group rather than pushing an individual agenda. Teamwork is important in a tactical sense, too. If you're willing to throw your efforts behind someone else's project, they'll be more likely to do the same for you in the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
