    "horoscope": "Today's cosmic influence highlights your stubborn streak. You're more opinionated than usual -- and that's saying something! You're also feeling more attached to what you consider yours. That includes people, and it can easily turn into possessiveness if you aren't careful. It's a better idea to think about why you're so attached to your opinions, possessions and loved ones. If there are feelings of vulnerability there, explore and process them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
