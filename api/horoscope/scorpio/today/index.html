    "horoscope": "You love mystery and intrigue. You might even have a secret taste for drama, because passion, drama's close cousin, is certainly right up your alley. But right now, don't make things any harder than they need to be. If you feel like stirring up a little trouble, resist it. You should be seeking common ground with other people now, not pointing out differences. Try cooperating with other people today. You'll be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
