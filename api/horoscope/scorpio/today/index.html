Get into the lighthearted, optimistic energy of the moment. Be tolerant of your loved ones, even if they're being impossibly silly -- or just impossible. It's up to you to create this positive vibe,. You can do it if you put your mind to it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
