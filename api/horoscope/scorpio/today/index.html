    "horoscope": "You're an emotional person at your core, and sometimes your feelings get in the way of logic or reason. But that isn't likely to happen today, because your mind and heart are working smoothly together. You're able to blend common sense with intuition, reason with compassion, with great results. This holistic perspective makes it easy to tackle whatever you might have on your agenda, whether professional or personal in nature.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
