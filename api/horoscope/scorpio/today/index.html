In the morning, you could be in an irritable mood, but don't let that ruin your day, and do your best to avoid contrary behavior. Thank goodness you ease gradually into a mellow mood. By evening, you're ready for a good meal and some downtime. Indulge your senses and make yourself comfortable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
