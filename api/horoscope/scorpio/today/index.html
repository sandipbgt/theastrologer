    "horoscope": "Your mind turns toward issues of human nature and emotion today. You can offer compassionate advice to a friend, or increase your own self-awareness through counseling or journal writing. But there's a darker potential to this influence, too. If you find yourself thinking obsessively about a certain person, or mulling over an unpleasant memory, it may be best to distract yourself! Turn your thoughts toward lighter subjects.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
