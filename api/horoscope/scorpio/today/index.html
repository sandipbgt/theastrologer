    "horoscope": "Be thrifty with your money today, and economical with your time, too. Figuring out ways to trim costs or cut corners -- but still do a good, thorough job -- feels like the best kind of mental workout. At the end of the day, you'll know you've done your best. And maybe you even got a little creative as you searched for ways to work within the constraints of a tight budget or a jam-packed agenda.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
