    "horoscope": "Your mind turns today from personal, emotional matters toward more global issues. Your vision turns outward and your mind opens. At least, that's the best potential of the current influence! Make an effort to step outside your usual perspective and experiences. This is no time for narrow thinking or routine activities. Instead, seek fresh experiences. Tap into your ideals and see if you can manifest them in real life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
