    "horoscope": "Stress has been creeping up on you, and now it's really hitting you hard. You're dissatisfied and trying to instigate a wide-scale rebellion. But what if your potential allies find you too intense? Not everyone feels the need to express their inner tensions with such zealous feelings.
