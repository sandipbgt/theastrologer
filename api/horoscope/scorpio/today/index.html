    "horoscope": "The world looks fresh now. Take a moment today to feel the energy and passion simmering just below your surface -- and remember that you can use these forces in many different ways. Obviously, manipulative behavior isn't a good expression of your strength; neither is an outburst of anger toward an unsuspecting person. Your actions today set the course for the next month of your life, so move forward with care and purpose."
