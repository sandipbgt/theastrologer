    "horoscope": "Your passion is right at the surface of your being today. You know exactly what you want. It's so real to you, you can almost taste it! Pursue your heart's desire now, but do keep a sense of perspective. The current influence strengthens that part of you that won't take no for an answer. In some situations, that's a real benefit. In others, it just isn't appropriate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
