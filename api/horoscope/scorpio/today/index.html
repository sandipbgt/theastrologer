    "horoscope": "Some things haven't been working for some time, and it's time to take stock so you can move forward. You're strong enough, and you're even eager to tackle the job. So it's time to make the decision to wrap up old business, once and for all. If you don't, who will? Not many people are as focused and directed as you are, especially right now. It's time to move to something new and promising. Make it happen today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
