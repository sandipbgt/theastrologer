    "horoscope": "Your insight into human nature deepens today. The current influence imparts extra empathy and compassion, making it even easier to understand what makes others tick -- which has always been a forte of yours anyway. You're feeling centered enough within yourself to offer kindness and assistance with no expectation of having them returned. This influence could also empower you to forgive someone for an old offense, and let the hurt go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
