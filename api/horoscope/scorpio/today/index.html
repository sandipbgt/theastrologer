    "horoscope": "At the moment, your emotional depths know no bounds. You're a natural and elemental force, like a wind that can blow both soft and strong. You're gentle-hearted and vulnerable even as you're powerful and incisive. That means you could stand up to an enemy as easily as you can reach out and console a friend who's feeling a little down. You just might gain a secret admirer today -- that's how compelling and mysterious you are, Scorpio. When it comes down to it, anything is possible!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
