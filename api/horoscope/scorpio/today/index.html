    "horoscope": "Anything other people are seeking today -- whether a strong ally, an intimate companion, even a fearsome opponent -- you're ready to oblige. You're looking for an intense way to engage with other people, and whatever your lover, friends or coworkers offer, you're happy to respond in kind. Emotionally, your range is wide. You can summon anger almost as readily as love, and either will be satisfying to vent. Move toward love and other positive connections, though. Soon you'll be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
