    "horoscope": "Seek out the company of someone you love and trust today. You need that close, affectionate connection and the other person probably does, too. A good talk or a warm hug is like a soothing balm for a troubled soul. The good news is, you're feeling rather centered and serene. You can lend an ear or give excellent advice, but a simple smile is all you need in return.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
