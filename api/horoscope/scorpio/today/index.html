Others are just as aware of this fact as you are, so there's no need to be boastful. In fact, this will only turn people off -- and you need them and their support. Be as humble as possible, and be open to their feedback. That's the way to ensure you have allies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
