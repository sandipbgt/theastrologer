    "horoscope": "Self-confidence is cool, but self-deception isn't. Sure, you're good, but you're only human, and that means mistakes can happen. It's easy to confuse ambition and temptation, especially if you handle other people's money or hold a public office. OK, that's all the soapbox preaching about morality that you'll need right now. Remember the warning and consider your luck. And don't forget about the untapped reserves you can find near the surface today. Grab yourself a shovel or a serving spoon and dig in. Don't be shy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
