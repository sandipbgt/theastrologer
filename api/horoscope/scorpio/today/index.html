    "horoscope": "Somehow, you seem to be attracting curious and helpless people today. They're following you like lost kittens. What -- do you have a sign on your back that says 'I Can Fix Anything'? Your competence shines through. Whatever you do, don't take unfair advantage of anyone. If someone comes to you for assistance, it's because they really need it. And here's a news flash: You need them, too. Think of this as a mutual partnership, and give it your fair and balanced attention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
