OK, maybe you're butting in where nobody asked you to be, but once they hear what you have to say, they'll be forced to admit that you're right and they're not. It also helps if you're right on time instead of after the fact, because hindsight isn't that impressive here and now. Experience is always valuable, though. You've been there, you've done that - now you're passing it on. That's how advice works.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
