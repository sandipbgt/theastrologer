Stand by to convince reasonable people just in case they don't trust what you're telling them. Yes, persuasive logic is still your strong suit. And you know what? It might even work on unreasonable people, too. There are only so many times they can say 'no' and 'I don't believe you' before the essence of what you're telling them finally sinks in. And if you say it with a smile today, you might even gain friends instead of making enemies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
