    "horoscope": "You possess a tremendous amount of self-control -- more than most people. And today you're especially able to defer momentary pleasures for future gain. This is easy to do when you know exactly what you're working toward, and your goal is clear in your mind. Strengthen this mental image with a quick, easy visualization. Sit still in a quiet room and picture the future you'd like to create. This will surely help you get there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
