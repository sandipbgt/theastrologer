    "horoscope": "Well, look who's all hoity-toity now! You're feeling superior over your friends and work mates, and it's got you all tensed up -- especially when you suspect that other people aren't quite as firmly convinced of your dominance as you are. Everyone's wondering: Why all the attitude today? Well, maybe you're having fun keeping them guessing. Don't push it too far, though. You'll want to have at least a few friends left when this mood passes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
