    "horoscope": "Today brings a chance to renovate your reputation. Maybe all it needs is a little housekeeping -- after all, people have always thought of you as versatile, but dependable. Now you're more able than usual to live up to their expectations. Show others that you're on their side, give your sweetie an extra-long hug, and call an old friend or relative you haven't spoken to in a while. When you're done, claim a little me time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
