If you've fallen off the wagon in some way, now you can bring great focus and determination to getting back to where you want to be with spending, eating or exercising. In general, a thorough, methodical approach works best now. Anything less, and you'll just have to go back later and redo it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
