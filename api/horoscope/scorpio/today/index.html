    "horoscope": "Emphasize harmony today. Instead of playing up your individuality or the differences between yourself and another person, find the common ground. Utilize those qualities or interests that draw you together and unite you in a shared goal. Working together is so much more powerful now than going it alone. Find a partner you trust, so you can be open about what you're trying to accomplish. Then you can make it happen together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
