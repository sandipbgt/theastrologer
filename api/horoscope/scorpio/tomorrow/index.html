That would be much better than taking it out on your sweetheart or coworkers. If you do find yourself acting out, or even if you're just having trouble sleeping at night, start focusing on what's really bothering you. Then work through it in a calm, direct way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
