    "horoscope": "Often, you take a personal view of life. But today, push yourself to take a broader, more philosophical outlook. You have a great opportunity now to recognize that you're just one, essential yet tiny part of this great universe. This perspective could be very helpful if you've been dealing with personal problems or heavy emotions. Realizing that you're a small part of a grand scheme can lift that weight right off your shoulders.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
