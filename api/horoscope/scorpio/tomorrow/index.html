    "horoscope": "Passion and intensity come bubbling up from the depths of your soul. Something is really moving you now. Whatever it is, your subconscious tries to seize control today, and turn all your careful plans into the work of pure instinct. Let  your intuition guide you toward that fantastic future you've envisioned for yourself. Stop trying to control all the factors and just go with the flow of the universe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
