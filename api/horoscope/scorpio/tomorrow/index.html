    "horoscope": "Your physical energy is high today. Your thoughts may speed up, too. This leads to a general feeling of urgency, as if you need to hurry up and -- what? Is there really anything so pressing that needs doing? If so, tackle it right away. Keep an eye on minor details and loose ends. It's easy to overlook that kind of thing now. And if nothing is that urgent, make an effort to relax. (c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
