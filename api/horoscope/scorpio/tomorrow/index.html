    "horoscope": "Obsessive and fastidious? Not you! Did you give anyone here permission to call you a control freak? As long as you get that joke, everything's cool. You're not exactly on a power trip. It's just that a tight focus is how you achieve things now. There's no room for slackers in your rigorous discipline. There's no room for cowards in the battles you have to fight. Dare to be great today. It's hard not to flaunt a little of the power and the glory.
