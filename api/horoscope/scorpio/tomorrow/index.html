    "horoscope": "Today, it's important to work with other people toward a common goal rather than toward a more individual or selfish aim. This could be tough, since it means committing to cooperating with others, even if you believe you have a better idea in mind. But it's good to stretch yourself in this way. Emphasize getting along and respecting the needs of the group. Challenge yourself to be as forward-thinking as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
