Besides, complexity is one of your favorite things. If life were always easy, it just wouldn't be as much fun! Enjoy working hard today. Remember to apply your energy in steady, measured doses, and take a break when you need to rest and recharge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
