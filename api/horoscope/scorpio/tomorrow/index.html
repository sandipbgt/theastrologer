You might get a kick out of watching everyone around you muddle through their mini-upheavals and other dramas today. Do your best to internalize your laughter. After all, some people -- okay, lots -- might not share your sense of humor about this strange, silly, all-too-human aspect of life. They might think your laughter is directed at them rather than at their situation, which will only hurt their feelings or put them on the defensive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
