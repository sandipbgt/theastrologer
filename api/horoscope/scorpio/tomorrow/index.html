    "horoscope": "Your thoughts and emotions are like a flood today, running far and wide, impossible to control. And that's okay. Think of this as being washed clean. Like everything else, it's a temporary state. Think of yourself as reeds in a riverbed, and let your feelings, worries and life itself wash over and through you. Feel everything -- because before you know it, poof! It's gone. Then you can deconstruct everything and discover what it all means.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
