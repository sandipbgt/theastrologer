    "horoscope": "Things aren't what they seem. People are a lot more valuable than you thought at first glance. You may develop deep attachments today. There's nothing wrong with being connected, you say. Everyone has to belong somewhere. Maybe yes, maybe no. Are you sure that you picked the right people or place? Is it the right moment?

Measure your passion before you let it run wild again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
