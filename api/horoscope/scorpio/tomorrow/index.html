    "horoscope": "It's easy to be patient with yourself and others today. Someone may not be performing up to your standards, but you aren't likely to get upset about it. You're very good at problem-solving now. If it's your employee or student, you'll simply speak to them about ways to be more efficient in their output. If it's your sweetheart or partner, you can inspire by example -- because you're certainly working hard and efficiently now, yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
