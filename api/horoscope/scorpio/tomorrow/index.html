It may seem like a normal display of power to you, but others might have different ideas about what's actually right for this situation. Before launching the attack yet again, listen to what they're saying. Going over the top won't actually be necessary today. A little energy, smoothly applied, is all you really need. Don't underestimate the power of subtlety. It could make you look like the coolest thing on two legs.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
