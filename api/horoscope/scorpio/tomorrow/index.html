    "horoscope": "Now isn't the time to be crafty or manipulative, no matter how sorely you might be tempted. Go for cautious optimism and sensible choices instead - in the long run, they'll get you a lot closer to your goals. You'll even notice minor benefits in the next day or two. And really, do you need everything all at once? You have enough of a sense of self-preservation to wait it out -- just trust that you'll get what's coming to you. The universe will take care of you, especially if you return the favor with patience, honesty, and humility.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
