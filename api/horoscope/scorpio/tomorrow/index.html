Accept what's freely offered today, and accept it graciously. Why be such a tyrant about these things, turning privileges into so-called rights? Maybe this fine opportunity will be repeated if you don't nip it in the bud. There's nothing weak about showing your sunny side. In fact, it's an indicator of strength when you know enough to power down from combat mode. Be a good citizen and make yourself useful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
