    "horoscope": "Stubbornness is one of your less attractive qualities, and it could be on full display today. You seem so fixed in your ways that other people are starting to call you an old geezer. But things could change as a result, and that's good news. It's time to get ready for whatever lies ahead. Remind yourself that you're strong and resilient. Perhaps that will help you greet life's ups and downs more gracefully.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
