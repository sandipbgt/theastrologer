It's hard to let go of suspicion or resentment and call on your own higher intentions. But today is all about getting along with others and assuming the best. Things are out of your hands for the moment, so what else can you really do but go with the flow? This is working against nature for you, of course, but you're smart and focused enough to make this brief period a success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
