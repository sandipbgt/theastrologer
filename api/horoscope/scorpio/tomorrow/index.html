Facts you receive now contain more relevant information than you realize. You just need to do some critical thinking to untangle the deeper meaning. You're a natural at that, so you'll be right in your element. Just let everyone else know so they don't bother to cover the same ground.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
