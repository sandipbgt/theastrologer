    "horoscope": "You enjoy deep conversations, but today, people may not be as willing as usual to delve into their pasts and personal lives. The current energy is far more intellectual than emotional in tone. You'll find that people shy away from intense feelings and interactions. It's best not to push someone into a confrontation if they don't seem open to it. Give them a few days. They'll get more in touch with their feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
