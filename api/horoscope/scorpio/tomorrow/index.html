    "horoscope": "You identify more strongly with your people today -- your family, perhaps, or your chosen group of friends. There's a sense of security that comes from the clan you come from, or the one you've built for yourself. It's a good day to nurture these people, whether emotionally, with hugs and kind words, or physically, with a nourishing meal. Give back some of the caring they have given to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
