    "horoscope": "At its best, today should be about pleasure and good times with people you care about deeply. Live life on the physical level: Enjoy textures and flavors, hugs and holding hands. Most of all, if you need to remind yourself to stay relaxed and easygoing, then do so. Un-knot any tension you're holding in your shoulders or your back. Work can wait, and problems can be solved later. For now, just live.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
