    "horoscope": "Today, you might be a little closer to extremes than usual. Remind yourself as often as possible to use your power moderately. Don't exploit anyone who's weak or confused, and don't rage at anyone, period. You want your friends and family to act with you, not against you. So keep your head engaged and your emotions in check if they seem too strong. You know plenty of good healthy outlets.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
