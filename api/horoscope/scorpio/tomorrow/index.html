Whatever you're doing now, it's a group effort, whether you realize that or not. You might prefer to take control of things, but you really need to work with other people now. Keep the good of the group in mind as you brainstorm and make decisions. Check your ego at the door.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
