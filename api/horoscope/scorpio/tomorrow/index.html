    "horoscope": "You're in the mood to hole up at home today, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Reconnecting every now and again with your friends, family or simply yourself centers you. Walking, journaling and other low-key activities are also a good idea now. The key here is to simplify your life and create a sense of inner calm by focusing on the people and places that mean the most to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
