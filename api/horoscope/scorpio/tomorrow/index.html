    "horoscope": "Focus is rarely an issue for you, but it certainly won't be today. It's a great day to delve into a project or a subject you find interesting. You can chase down details and be extra thorough in analyzing them. If you're trying to develop a system of some kind, you'll find great success today. The current influence also favors rules and routines, especially those you establish for yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
