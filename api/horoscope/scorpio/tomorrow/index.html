    "horoscope": "It's a great day to tap into your deepest emotions, because they're easy to access now. But instead of getting caught up in your own internal dramas, focus on connecting with other people and even helping someone through their own tough feelings. You make a wonderful counselor, Scorpio, because you're a good listener and you really understand human nature. Put that skill to good use today. Someone could use your help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
