    "horoscope": "Well, you're in a rather sarcastic mood today, aren't you? It's a downer for the people around you. Surely you don't want to ruin someone else's good mood. Instead, strive for the kinder, gentler path. Being compassionate and accepting will make you feel good about yourself, whereas being grouchy or overly sensitive will only make you feel worse. Act like a friend, and you just might start feeling like one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
