You're in a highly creative mindset under the current influence, and you're particularly susceptible to anything that appeals to that side of you. Let your thoughts enter the realm of fantasy. Entertain delicious visions, even if they could never be real.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
