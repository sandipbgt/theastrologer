    "horoscope": "Even if the day gets off to a rocky start, don't worry -- things will improve by afternoon. In the morning, you could be in an irritable mood, but don't let that ruin your day, and do your best to avoid contrary behavior. Thank goodness you ease gradually into a mellow mood. By evening, you're ready for a good meal and some downtime. Indulge your senses and make yourself comfortable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
