    "horoscope": "New places and experiences never seemed so compelling as they do today. Why not take a look at your budget and see if you can afford a trip to someplace you've never been before? This isn't as spontaneous as simply jumping in the car and taking off for parts unknown, but it offers its own sense of adventure. Besides,, you're too aware of the potential for running into snags to be at all irresponsible. That's part of your strength, and your charm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
