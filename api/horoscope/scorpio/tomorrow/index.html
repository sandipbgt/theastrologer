For example, if you've been researching a project, today is perfect for networking. Describe your work to other people and get them interested in your theories. No one is an island, including you. This is your chance to gain both perspective and support before moving forward.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
