    "horoscope": "Things might be gloomy for some people, but you certainly don't have to buy into their darkness. Navigate these murky waters by whatever light you can shine. Pretend to be happy if that will invite the spirit of improvement. Accept those annoying little variables that separate people and undermine the plans they make together. As for you, you'll make progress today. Maybe things have moved faster for you at other times, but at least whatever action you get will be a lot better than standing still.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
