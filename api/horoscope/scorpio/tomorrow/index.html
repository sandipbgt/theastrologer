    "horoscope": "No matter how much someone at work or at home has hurt your feelings today, you need to set aside your small grievances. Take a look at the large-scale plan. That's what's truly important, not the petty thing someone said that upset you. Your own ego doesn't even matter that much in the face of what you're trying to accomplish. Today, choose your battles well. What's your purpose here? Take your time in answering that one, so you can draw the right conclusion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
