    "horoscope": "Usually you're a master of discretion, but sometimes it's nearly impossible to keep your thoughts to yourself, and today could be one of those days. You're quietly impatient -- not just with the status quo, but with all the new ideas that are occurring to you. Still, try to keep them private until you've thought them though.
