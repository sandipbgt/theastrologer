    "horoscope": "You possess tremendous compassion, and today, that gift is right at the surface of your consciousness. If an opportunity arises to offer advice or support to a friend, you'll do so with great sensitivity. After all, this is one of your greatest strengths: your ability to understand people's fears and passions, their urges and their hang-ups. When you're feeling centered, as you are now, it's no hardship to offer genuine kindness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
