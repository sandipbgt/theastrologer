    "horoscope": "Beware of any feelings of pride or self-righteousness that may influence you today. You're operating under some tricky energy, and you could convince yourself you deserve more power and control than you really do. Those closest to you will think you've got a lot of nerve if you show attitude for no good reason. Don't let that kind of bad behavior bring you down. Instead, find a positive use for this energy. Help someone else, or channel it into your work. Soon you'll calm down and come to your senses.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
