    "horoscope": "Once you yielded to the greater force. It was easier to just go along. Maybe you were a believer, or even a diehard supporter. But something is different. Now you're questioning all those familiar rules and doctrines, or toying with the idea of going over to the rebels. You want to see something happen. You want to take some untried theory, make it real, and show it to the crowd. There may be a price for this, but if so, you'll pay it. The idea of change appeals to you that much.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
