    "horoscope": "You crave closeness with your loved ones today. Harmony seems more important now than usual, so you're willing to go out of your way to get along with others. For example, you might keep certain wishes or opinions to yourself, ones you'd normally speak up about. But you're a strong person. It's rare that you'd let anyone take advantage of you. So it's okay to give a little ground now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
