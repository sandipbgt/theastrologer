    "horoscope": "Today, you may be in the mood to thumb through old journals or photo albums, and remember 'the good ol' days' -- the way things used to be. Ah, such sweet memories of the past! You've been through many experiences and changes, haven't you? You might not want to regress back to the way things once were, but sometimes it's nice to revisit those old feelings and memories anyway, just for a day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
