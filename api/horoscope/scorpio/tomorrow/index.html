You're working toward stability at the very least, and perhaps a solid reputation, too. There's a lot of power in being this determined -- and not just when your employer is looking, either. Of course, that word of caution is probably unnecessary, since you believe in hard work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
