    "horoscope": "You're always looking deeply inward, whether into your own thoughts and feelings or someone else's. Today, turn your focus outward. Get broadminded, lighthearted and optimistic. It's time to lighten your mental load, if only for a day. Movies and novels are a great escape now, because they transport you to another time and place. And ultimately, they still give you insight and help you understand human nature better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
