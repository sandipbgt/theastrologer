    "horoscope": "Today your emotions are prominent. In fact, you're experiencing life almost solely through that subjective lens of feeling. And yet, it's easier than usual to look outside yourself and your own needs. You feel a deep urge to help others. You want to be generous toward them, especially those who are experiencing sadness or weakness. You have a lot of strength to offer someone who needs to lean on your support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
