    "horoscope": "You're restless and uncomfortable. You aren't used to being indecisive or unable to focus, but both of those are issues today. Is there something you've been thinking about that you aren't saying? If so, this is a good time to get it off your chest. If the problem is that you aren't sure what you're feeling, talking it out will still help, because it will let you clarify your thoughts and your options.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
