Your friends don't seem to understand anything you say, and your coworkers are tackling projects in the most inefficient way possible. And you, of course, have the best idea for how everything should be done -- and you aren't budging, or even listening to others' input. Well, you're in a stubborn space, that's for sure. Just go easy on the tongue-lashings, okay?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
