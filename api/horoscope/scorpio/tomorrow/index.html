    "horoscope": "Conversations reveal other people's secrets to you today, as plainly as if they'd shouted them from the rooftops. You're like a master counselor -- someone who can see past others' excuses and evasions to their true feelings and motivations. This gives you a lot of power, you know. And you like that. Be sure to use it to help others. This kind of insight helps you to give wonderful, caring advice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
