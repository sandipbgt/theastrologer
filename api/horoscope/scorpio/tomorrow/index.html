    "horoscope": "Today, you're most at home in familiar surroundings, where you know you're in control of your environment. Spending time with strangers, such as at a party or a professional conference, may put you outside your comfort zone. On the other hand, you're mentally strong enough to turn any situation to your own advantage. Just remember, you're at your best when spending time with people who draw out your genuine, nurturing side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
