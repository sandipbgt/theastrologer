Emotionally, you're feeling a bit reserved, which isn't like you. The good news is, this is just a brief phase that will pass soon. In the meantime, stick to ideas and theories. These will keep your mind occupied, and you might even come up with something useful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
