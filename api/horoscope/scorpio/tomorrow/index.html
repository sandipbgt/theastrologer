Connecting with your people makes you feel safe and emotionally centered. On that note, it's a great day to delve into old photos or other memories from the past. Remind yourself where you came from. Gain insight from exploring the people and places that made you who you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
