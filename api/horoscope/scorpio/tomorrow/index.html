    "horoscope": "You may be more emotional today than usual -- and that's saying something, since you're a feeling person by nature. But this should be a grounded state, not a moody one. You're in touch with your inner self, and that helps you relate to others in a kinder, more genuine way. Hug your loved ones close and extend a hand to someone in need. Selfless acts of kindness expand your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
