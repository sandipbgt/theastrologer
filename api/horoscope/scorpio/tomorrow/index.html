    "horoscope": "Your will is strong today. A sense of inner strength guides you now. Your goal is clear asin your mind. And all you have to do is stay focused. Keep repeating to yourself -- 'This is my moment.' With that level of intensity and intention, you can do anything! And if your goals will benefit other people besides yourself, then surely the universe will assist you in reaching them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
