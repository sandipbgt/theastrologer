    "horoscope": "Your emotions may be all over the place today. You're a deeply passionate person, and those strong feelings swell under the current influence. So does your urge to act and react according to your emotions. If you feel jealous of someone, for example, you're more likely now to make a cutting comment, though you'd keep your own counsel on a different day. Avoid burning bridges if you can!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
