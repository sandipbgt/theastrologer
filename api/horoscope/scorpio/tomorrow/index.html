    "horoscope": "Today, it's possible that you're completely misreading a certain situation. Here's hoping you return to reality soon, because as long as you stay caught up in this little fantasy of dominance and mutiny, you aren't likely to accomplish very much that's actually productive. You might even end up annoying an important other or compromising your health in some way. Don't stress yourself out. Rein in that attitude and work with others instead of against them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
