Understanding what makes them tick is easy now, because you're listening with more than just your ears. You're tuned in at the heart level, and your instincts are humming like a finely calibrated machine. This makes it easy to connect with the people you care about. Supporting them emotionally comes naturally to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
