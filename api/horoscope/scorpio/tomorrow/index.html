    "horoscope": "You're cautious about preserving your relationships and resources, because you're aware of how frail and easily damaged connections can be. And it's fine to protect what you have, but for today, there's no need to throw up so many fortifications. Things are moving along pretty well in your life, which frees you up to travel light. Baggage just isn't your thing at the moment. Enjoy this lightness of being. Think about where you want to go next.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
