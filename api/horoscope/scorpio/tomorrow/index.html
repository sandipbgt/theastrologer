    "horoscope": "It's good to think about things, especially if it's been a while since your last review. With a truly open mind, you won't get all jittery if something seems to challenge your faith or nibble at your security. There's a way to handle this. Keep your questions simple today, because the answers may be far more complex than you first thought, and you may need extra time to absorb all the rich detail. Take advantage of your firm grasp on how things work. That'll be your best starting point for getting past how and into why.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
