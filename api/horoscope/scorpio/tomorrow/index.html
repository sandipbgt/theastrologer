    "horoscope": "Today, it's important to get along with your friends, coworkers, spouse or anyone else you interact with on a regular basis. This may mean going out of your way to keep the peace. Choose your battles. Instead of responding to every inequality and slight, imagined or real, let some things slide in the name of harmony. Sometimes it's better just to turn the other cheek. Address it later, if you must.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
