    "horoscope": "Today, you're experiencing life from a highly subjective perspective. Of course, you've always been an emotional being. But now your feelings are softer than usual. You might even feel a bit vulnerable, but this is a pleasurable sensation. It makes intimate moments with the people you love even more meaningful. In this state of mind, a beautiful song or a smile from a child has the power to soothe your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
