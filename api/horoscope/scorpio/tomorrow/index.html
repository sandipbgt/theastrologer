    "horoscope": "If you've been looking for a definitive answer, good news -- now you have it. The details have come together, and your mind is sharp enough to assimilate them. Better yet, your heart's involved too, keeping you functioning smoothly as a whole and holistic being. You're feeling softhearted and friendly, ready to connect with others. At work and among family and friends, you can now inspire cooperation on your own terms. Use this gift to get everyone working together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
