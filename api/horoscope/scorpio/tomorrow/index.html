    "horoscope": "Do your best today to understand viewpoints that differ from your own. There's a strong tendency now to cling to your own perspective, which can lead to narrow-mindedness. Tap instead into your strong compassionate streak. Instead of assuming you know what someone else thinks or feels and why, ask them about their thoughts. You'll find you can challenge your own assumptions and expand your mind if you just stay open to surprises.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
