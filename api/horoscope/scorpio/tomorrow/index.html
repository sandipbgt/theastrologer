    "horoscope": "Don't downplay your skills and pretend you can't do very much today. You'd only be cheating yourself. Don't start a revolution when there's an easier way. Imagine the mess you'd have to clean up, or how others would feel if you made them clean it up. Feelings of defeat can be seductive, but wouldn't you rather snuggle up with the winners? Of course you would. The first step in trying to improve yourself is to remember how good at this you really are. You'll be riding high once it all comes back to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
