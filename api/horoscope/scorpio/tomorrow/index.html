You may have to work for their recognition, and that's OK -- refining your product or approach will only help in the long run. By the time you have your say, you'll know it by heart, and you'll dazzle everyone. You won't even need to say 'I told you so' -- their praise and support will be reward enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
