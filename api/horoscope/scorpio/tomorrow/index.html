    "horoscope": "You've been keeping to yourself, haven't you? When the phone rings, you let your voicemail answer. When a friend sends an e-mail, you file it away for later response. And that's okay. Seclusion suits you well right now. Your focus and energy have turned inward.  You're taking sublime inventory of your true, inner self. It's best to keep your own counsel today. That way, you can tighten your focus and establish a solid plan for the moment you'll spring into action. And when that happens, well -- watch out, world!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
