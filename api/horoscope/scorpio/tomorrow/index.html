    "horoscope": "A partnership has you feeling upset and self-protective, but try to control your extreme urges. A fresh point of view would help, too. Though you may not see it yet, there's plenty of room to meet in the middle. So do your best to calm down and compromise. Even if you have to fake it, you're sure to have better results than if you were more aggressive or less cooperative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
