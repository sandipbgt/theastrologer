    "horoscope": "You enjoy delving deeply into a subject, project or relationship as it allows you to gain an intimate understanding of the object of your attention. But that intense focus all too easily can turn into obsession, which limits your scope. For now, try peeling back the walls of your tunnel vision. You need the big picture today, not an interior or micro-scale view. Once you pull out to the broader view, you'll find there's a whole lot to see and take in -- so much that you won't have to act for a while.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
