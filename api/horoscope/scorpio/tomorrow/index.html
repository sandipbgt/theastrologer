    "horoscope": "Today you're reticent about the future. It's not that you're not interested -- far from it. It's just that at the moment, you prefer to keep your plans, hopes, and fears to yourself. Maybe you're worried that talking about your insecurities will make them real. Maybe you're just trying to avoid anyone stealing your good ideas. Whatever's going on, if you do decide to talk, go easy on the highbrow references -- it's probably not that kind of crowd. Your coworkers, family, and friends want straightforward, honest information, not coy or abstract quotations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
