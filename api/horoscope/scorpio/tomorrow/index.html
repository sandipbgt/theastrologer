    "horoscope": "Well, this is a rather interesting position. They're depending on you because of a valuable service you provide. It's probably some little thing you could do with your eyes closed, but whatever. For you, on the other hand, hanging out here is your perfect excuse to be nosy. If they want your help, their business is your business. Fair enough, but what are your plans for that information? Remember the things you're not supposed to know, and don't breathe a word about them today. Because if anyone traces the slightest whiff of gossip back to you, you're toast.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
