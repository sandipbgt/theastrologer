    "horoscope": "You feel good about being so in control of your life today. You feel a solid sense of satisfaction as you roll up your sleeves and get to work. With this attitude, you can get a lot done. Organize yourself early by making a prioritized list of all your tasks, and check each one off as you accomplish it. You'll make great headway today, and sleep really well tonight.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
