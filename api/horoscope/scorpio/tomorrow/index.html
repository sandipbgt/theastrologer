    "horoscope": "You're craving a sweet, affectionate emotional connection with someone, but you may not go about achieving it in the right way. Try to be open and warm, because even mild feelings of insecurity or vulnerability could shut other people out. So focus on common ground instead of what seems to separate you from your friends. Make a conscious choice to laugh and enjoy others' company. You'll be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
