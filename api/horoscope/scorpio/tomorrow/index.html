    "horoscope": "A nice, warm energy permeates life today -- for most people, at least. For you, things could get a little tricky. A situation could come up that tests your ego drives. You want to be in charge now. You want others to recognize your prowess or your contribution. There's nothing wrong with that. Just try not to get pushy or upset over it. Be graceful, even if you feel you're being overlooked.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
