Guess you'll just have to be plain and simple when you're communicating with others. Actually, this might be a good exercise for you, since you're used to being cagey and mysterious. Sometimes it's good to relate with the world on its terms instead of your own. It keeps you honest. Practice that skill today by being genuine with everyone you encounter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
