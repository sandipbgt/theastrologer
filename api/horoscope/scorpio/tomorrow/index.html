    "horoscope": "You've had some hunches lately regarding something important in your life -- perhaps the direction a friendship is taking, or maybe the proper next step in a professional endeavor.

For now, focus on getting the information you need to make the right decision.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
