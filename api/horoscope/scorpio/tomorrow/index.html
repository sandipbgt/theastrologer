    "horoscope": "You get a kick out of stirring things up, but today try to be as constant and agreeable as possible. Sounds boring, but it's your destiny to be stuck here with these people, at least for now. You may as well make the best of it by trying to get along. Who knows? Someone in the bunch might surprise you by turning out to be far more unusual and interesting than you expected. Even without any such pleasant surprises, you'll be glad you put in the effort. It will result in allies you can call upon later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
