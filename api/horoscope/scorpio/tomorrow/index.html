    "horoscope": "Emotional balance is key today. Make an effort to stay calm and kind, even if you're incredibly frustrated with your spouse or coworker! Arguments and other conflicts do more harm than good now, unless you can find a way to talk things out in a fair-minded way. In that case, make sure all parties involved feel heard, understood and respected. Then you stand a good chance of working things out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
