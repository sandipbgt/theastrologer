Well, you could try, but your best bet might be something more radical. Withdraw from the situation for the day and see how it looks from the outside. Or you could turn your back and walk away. That may seem harsh, but if you drop some emotional baggage and lighten your load, you'll find that it's totally OK to move on and start over.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
