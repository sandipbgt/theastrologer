    "horoscope": "You'll probably feel most comfortable today around the people you know and love best. Like a lot of people, you may be in a clannish mood, a common response to the current influence. Your need for inner security is pronounced, making you seek out the places and people that make you feel at home. Don't forget that you're home to other people, too. You're the very source of nurturing comfort that makes them feel safe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
