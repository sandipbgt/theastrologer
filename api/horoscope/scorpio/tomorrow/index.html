    "horoscope": "Welcome to a pleasant, peaceful day. Time spent with friends or family should be harmonious. Intense emotional displays are no fun for anyone now, so avoid them if you can. That might mean making a special effort to choose your battles, including choosing to ignore minor irritations. Of course, you'll have to talk out any bigger issues that come up. Do so with a level head and an eye for fairness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
