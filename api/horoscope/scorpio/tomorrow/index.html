Don't rush to judgment today. Don't cut corners or go to extremes. There's another way. You just haven't found it yet, that's all. It's OK to bend with the prevailing wind, even if it goes against your training. Discovery will blow through your life when you least expect it. You can't even imagine what will happen then, nor should you try. Keep your mind open and your datebook empty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
