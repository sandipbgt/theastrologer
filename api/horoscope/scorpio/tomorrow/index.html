You'll find that joining forces with other people refines your own thinking and efforts. You have a lot to add to the group. Plus you can learn from watching others in action. And there's just a certain magic that's created now through cooperative efforts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
