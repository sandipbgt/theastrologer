    "horoscope": "Your passion is right at the surface today. How will you channel it?

When your feelings are stirred up, you have to be careful about how you express them. The current energy could have you jumping to conclusions prematurely.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
