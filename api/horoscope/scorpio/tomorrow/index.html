Thank goodness you're prudent, and this should be especially so about who you get involved with today. Some people are just so easily shocked, and you don't want any rumors or innuendoes started about you. So move with caution rather than abandon, no matter how frisky you feel.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
