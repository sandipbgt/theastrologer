    "horoscope": "Today is not a day for staying home and entertaining serious thoughts. Quite the opposite! The current energy is perfect for getting out of the house and having some fun. Seek out companions who enjoy a little adventure, or perhaps some mental stimulation. On that note, it's a great time to lighten things up with a poetry reading or an interesting debate with your friends -- something unusual and intellectual that exercises your mind.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
