    "horoscope": "This is no time to be selfish. When you get the urge to sneer at someone or to split off and do your own thing, remember that true courage lies in participating. In your head, you may feel like an outsider. Your heart knows you're where you need to be, surrounded by helpful allies and loving friends. Today will help level the playing field, so throw your back into the project at hand. It might be a slow process, but the work is necessary, and you'll be glad you did it when you reap the benefits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
