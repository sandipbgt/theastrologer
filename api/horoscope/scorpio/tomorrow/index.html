    "horoscope": "If you encounter someone tactless today, don't engage in their pettiness by calling them on it or serving up more of the same. Instead, be the socially graceful one -- transcend their social ignorance and respond to what you know their true intentions must have been. You'll gain points in everyone's book, and you'll feel better knowing you rose above temptation. Plus, you'll set a good example for everyone else. Don't you wish you could always be this well-mannered?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
