    "horoscope": "Matters of the heart take center stage today. You're feeling softer and more vulnerable now, in the best way. It's easier to open up to others when you're in such a state. Your own sensitivities enable you to empathize with someone else's emotions. You can be gentle with them, and they'll be gentle with you in return. You're also tuned in to life at the right level for a spiritual awakening.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
