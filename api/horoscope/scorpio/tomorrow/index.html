    "horoscope": "Making an intellectual connection with someone today is especially stimulating. And it doesn't hurt if that someone is easy on the eyes! You're a passionate person by nature, and there's nothing wrong with responding to the warmth of attraction. You're especially attuned to beauty now, and to symmetry as well. You want an equal, balanced exchange with everyone from your sweetheart to your business partner to a stranger on the street.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
