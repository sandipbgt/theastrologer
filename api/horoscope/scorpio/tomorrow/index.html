But today offers you a chance to heal, so make an honest effort to put positive energy out into the world. Staying calm and extending yourself to others will help you strike a much-needed balance between your own concerns and the needs of others. And people will really appreciate, and remember, your careful assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
