    "horoscope": "Watch out for drama today, and do your best to avoid either creating or getting sucked into turbulent encounters. People's passions are aroused now, and you're quite a passionate person as it is. You also have a stubborn streak, which is stimulated right now. You might even court trouble with other people, just for the excitement of going head to head! Instead of creating drama, tap into the good feelings that are readily available.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
