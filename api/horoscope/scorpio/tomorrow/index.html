    "horoscope": "Today you'll be skeptical and impatient. You'll try to get a laugh at other people's expense, and it'll just make things even worse if you end up laughing alone. You'll try to guide development and growth with an iron hand, making rules no one else ever heard of. Forget that -- it won't work. Even if you wrapped it in a velvet glove, you'd still have a hard sell. Bottom line? Brute force isn't an option no matter how you dress it up. Try compromise instead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
