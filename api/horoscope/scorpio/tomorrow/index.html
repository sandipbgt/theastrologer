    "horoscope": "You're in an unusually self-sacrificing mood today, and there's no hidden agenda here. You sincerely want to help others, which is one of your natural strengths. Plus, you're even more intuitive than usual, so reach out to someone who needs some good advice or a compassionate ear. When you help someone, you're creating good karma, Scorpio. This is sure to come back around to you sooner or later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
