    "horoscope": "Yesterday's compassionate mood switches today to something much more energetic -- maybe too energetic. Suddenly, you're on edge. Aggressive urges pop out before you even realize how you're feeling, and you could end up lashing out at someone who doesn't deserve it. Watch out for tricky, powerful feelings like suspicion and anger. Know that these have more to do with you and your current mindset than with the other person.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
