    "horoscope": "It's good to have convictions, and your strong perspective and opinions are a large part of what defines you. But pushing your views on other people isn't always the right move, and this is one of those times. Reach out to others instead of pushing them away with aggressive, bullying behavior. Maybe they don't understand what you've been saying. If you say it again in a normal, reasonable tone, there's a much higher likelihood that they'll listen this time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
