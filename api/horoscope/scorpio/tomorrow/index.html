How spectacular is that? A little celebration is okay, but you should be tuning into some very real possibilities that are already crying out for your attention. Your smart enough to know how to profit from all this. Maybe you'll be the first person to exploit what lies on the other side of transformation. Take whatever the law allows.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
