    "horoscope": "You feel restless today, deep down in your soul. You ache for excitement, and you want to stir up the people around you. Exercise caution, because you could easily talk too much now, or to the wrong person, and end up saying something you'll regret later. You're better off expressing your thoughts in a private manner, such as writing them down in your journal. That way, they can't hurt anyone -- including you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
