You've always been adept at manifesting your own reality, and now that skill is heightened. Give voice or form to your dreams and fantasies. Paint, write, sing or dance to create a fluid connection among your mind, body and heart. Become the artist, poet or musician you've always been on the inside.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
