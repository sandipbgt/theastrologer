    "horoscope": "This could be one of those all-talk, no-action days. That may not be your favorite kind of day, but try to roll with it anyway. You never know when an important opportunity or connection might arise. It could happen in the midst of a seemingly meaningless, chit-chatty conversation. Besides, sometimes it's fun just to visit with your fellow humans. Enjoy the many exchanges you'll have throughout the day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
