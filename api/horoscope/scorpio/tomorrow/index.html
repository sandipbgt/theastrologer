    "horoscope": "Today, you're full of interesting and intense energy. You're actually creating it, with your cultured, magnetic charm. You're even a little dangerous. It's important for you to recognize the vibes you're putting out, because they affect the people around you, especially those you're closest to -- including your friends, your sweetie, or your business partner. Furthermore, if you aren't careful, your unconscious desires could take over and you'll end up attracting someone you'll later wish you'd left alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
