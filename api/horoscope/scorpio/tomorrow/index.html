Isolation feels okay for short periods of time, especially if you're savoring old memories and other mementos of the past. But other people want you to engage emotionally in the present.

Even if someone has invited you to join in, you can still reenter the world on your own terms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
