    "horoscope": "You've been working hard, haven't you? And you're applying your energy cheerfully, which makes your projects more fun for everyone. Today's results should lead to even better opportunities down the road. Apply yourself while this energy boost lasts. In a similar vein, be sure to accept support when it's offered, and extend your own aid to any friends or loved ones in need. They'll remember how you stepped up, and they'll get behind you when you need it most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
