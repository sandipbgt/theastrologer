    "horoscope": "Anti-heroes and jokers have their place, but you don't always have to fill those roles. Why not try on the white hat for a few days and play the respectable citizen? Draw on your abiding sense of what's right. Show your well-mannered side. Let bygones be bygones, and let your potential speak to the future. But don't be planning your next wicked conquest while you're still pretending to be the good guy. Focus on the moment. And if things happen you don't intend, be polite and follow someone else's lead. Share the responsibility instead of taking the blame.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
