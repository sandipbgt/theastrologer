    "horoscope": "Clearly you have a lot of personal power. Your charisma is undeniable. Even more than that, if pressed, others would probably admit that you're the one in control of the relationship. But that doesn't mean you can use that power however you want. In fact, it gives you extra responsibility to use your position reasonably, especially today. Remember that some secrets are best left unspoken at this time, and maybe forever.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
