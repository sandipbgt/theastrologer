You've done your research, and you understand the subject better than most. But maybe the other person has a valid point, too. It's good to listen to the other side, even if you disagree. That actually helps you build your case, so you can speak calmly and humbly, but with the ring of truth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
