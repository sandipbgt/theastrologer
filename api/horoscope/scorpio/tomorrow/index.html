    "horoscope": "Today, you're drawn to unusual people, places and ideas. Or course, many people are thinking more creatively right now, and exploring your own inventiveness is never a bad idea. But depending on your personality, you could go pretty dark with this! It's a good time to get into complex, mysterious subjects -- and you do love uncovering secrets. But respect others' privacy, and think twice before dabbling in strangeness for its own sake.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
