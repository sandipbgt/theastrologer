A meal shared with loved ones is also a great way to fill that need for emotional sustenance, since it combines the two greatest sources of nurturing: good food and good company! If a friend is having trouble, you can help by offering sensitive, caring advice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
