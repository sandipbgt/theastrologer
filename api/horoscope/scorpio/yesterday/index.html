    "horoscope": "Maybe it's all a big show-and-tell for you, but there's such a thing as too much information. Keep all your drama onstage today. Shroud your personal life in the kind of modesty that deflects attention instead of the kind of mystery that begs other people to snoop around in curiosity. You'd just have to brush them off when they got too close for comfort. They'd think you were going back on your invitation, and there would be chaos and bad feelings. Make things easier for yourself, not harder. Know when to remain silent.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
