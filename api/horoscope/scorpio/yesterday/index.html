    "horoscope": "Today, you're in touch with your spiritual side. Do something to honor this state of mind. Helping someone in need soothes your soul. So does meditating on your faith or communing with nature. It's a great time for a long walk with your dog or your best friend, writing poetry or taking a midday nap. It's in these quiet moments that you receive reflections of your own soul, and self-understanding grows.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
