    "horoscope": "Your urge now might be to hole up somewhere with the only person you trust -- yourself. But being private and self-sufficient is no stand-in for human company and input. Remember, you need other people, even if you're suspicious. In the end, they are what's important -- not your ambitions. Besides, you should make sure you've understood the situation correctly before making a move. Maybe things aren't what they seem. Hold your cards for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
