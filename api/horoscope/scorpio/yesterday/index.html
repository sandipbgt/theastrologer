    "horoscope": "Mental workouts are highlighted today. Using your brainpower to solve a problem feels great! Like a good workout in the gym, it reveals your intellectual strength and the sharpness of your thinking. But this isn't just about patting yourself on the back for being an intelligent, insightful person. The mental work you do today should focus outward, on the group. There's honor in trying to make broad-scale improvements for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
