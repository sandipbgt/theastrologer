Especially if you've been going through a rough patch with your honey, or even if you simply haven't told your business partner lately how much you value their work and contributions, use the current energy to build a bridge between you. Expressing heartfelt appreciation now will go a long way toward keeping your connection warm and close in the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
