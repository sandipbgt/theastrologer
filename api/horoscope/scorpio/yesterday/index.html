    "horoscope": "Someone has offended you, and instead of taking a kind, understanding view, you're being stiff and intolerant. Can you take the high road, and forgive and forget? It's likely they didn't realize they were hurting your feelings. If you just can't get over it, you'll have to find a way to address the issue calmly and directly. Don't lash out or indulge in revenge fantasies -- simply tell them how you feel, and take it from there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
