Gut reactions count for a lot now, and having confidence in your own ability to perceive subtle cues can make all the difference in protecting yourself against untrustworthy people. You can also avoid sticky situations by following that helpful inner voice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
