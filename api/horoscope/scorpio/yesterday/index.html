    "horoscope": "Your partnerships are highlighted today. If you've taken charge too many times lately of what should be a joint effort -- raising a child, managing a household, working on a collaborative creative or professional project -- it's time to step back and let the other person have their say. It's hard to give up control, but you'll feel better and your life will run more smoothly when you can share the spotlight with others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
