Your home can be someone else's refuge now; so can your strong shoulder, soft heart or sympathetic ear. This kind of support of another person is sure to bring good things your way in the future -- not that that's why you should pitch in. Do it because you're secure enough to share your many blessings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
