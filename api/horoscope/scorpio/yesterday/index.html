    "horoscope": "You're feeling more easygoing than usual, happy to connect with friends and family in an open, balanced way. Your loved ones make you laugh, and you appreciate their company at a level that you might not normally. Even arguments don't get overly heated, because you're being generous and diplomatic instead of insisting on your own point of view. You'll probably notice that other people seem to feel much closer to you, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
