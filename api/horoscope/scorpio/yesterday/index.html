That's just how you are. But if you feel like opening up today about these changes, that's okay too. In fact, more than okay. Someone could learn a lot from what you've been through. Share your experiences. You'll receive a lot of support for your insights, humility and vulnerability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
