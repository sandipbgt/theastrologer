    "horoscope": "Are you coming across as a know-it-all? If people rebel against your attempts at controlling them, focus on why you're pretending to be in charge. Maybe, deep down, you're feeling vulnerable. Ah-ha! Now, there's a thought. If you have a close friend or intimate partner you can open up to, now would be a good time to get vulnerable. If you talk out your feelings, you're likely to realize they're just that -- feelings, and not a reflection of reality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
