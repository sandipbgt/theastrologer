Rise to the challenge by tuning in to the bigger picture and painting a broad perspective. Right now, people understand philosophies and theories better than details. They want concepts, not the fine points. And you know just how to deliver.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
