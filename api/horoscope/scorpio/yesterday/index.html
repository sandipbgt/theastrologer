    "horoscope": "Whether you're on the road or spending time at home, you're happy. Life feels sweet and easy today, and you're more aware than usual of your many blessings. This, in turn, breeds yet another gift: Your outlook is sure to become more worldly. You're in too fine a mood to cast harsh judgment on anyone else. Though you usually guard your heart carefully, now it's soft and mellow, ready to understand and accept just about anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
