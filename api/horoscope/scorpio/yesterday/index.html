There are many methods for accomplishing the same task, not just your way. That's what cultural awareness is about. Remembering this will help shake you out of your usual, sometimes stubborn view of things, so you can appreciate this wonderfully diverse world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
