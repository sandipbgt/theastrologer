In fact, you feel emotionally centered. Your personal core of strength -- that feeling part of your soul -- is empowered by the current influence. You're compassionate and big-hearted, and you're putting out wonderfully positive energy into the universe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
