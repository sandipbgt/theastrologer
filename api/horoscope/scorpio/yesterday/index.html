You want to hear people's stories of hardship, and not just because you find human nature interesting. You genuinely empathize with their difficult feelings and tough times. You may get a chance to offer someone good advice today. At the very least, you can offer them an attentive ear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
