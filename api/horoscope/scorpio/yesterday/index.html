    "horoscope": "Instead of getting mixed up in the drama and hubbub of the moment, seek peace and quiet today. If your nerves aren't already a little frayed, they're in danger of being so. You need to conserve your mental energy. Instead of starting anything new --  projects, relationships and other endeavors -- finish up something that's already on your plate. Don't worry about missing out on anything. You'll know when things start happening, because opportunity will come knocking at your door.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
