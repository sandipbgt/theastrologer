Providence is sure to favor you today, because there's a genuine method to your madness. You know what you're doing, even if it looks a little funny to other people. Still, a backup plan might not be a bad idea. This allows you to free up your imagination, so it can run alongside your instincts and your intelligence as you brainstorm new ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
