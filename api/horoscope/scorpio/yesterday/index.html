The time has come to move forward, and if that means tying up loose ends on a few things, so be it. Anything that ends now is meant to end, because space is needed for something brand-new. Don't bother asking anyone's permission before you act. You're too self-contained for that. And you'll probably need clearance if you wait any longer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
