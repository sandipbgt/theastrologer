    "horoscope": "Today, you have new insight into your own past or that of a friend. Old memories come up, bringing strong feelings with them. If you let these emotions saturate you, and inspect the memories attached to them, you'll turn a key and unlock something important. This could be a sad experience, but it's sure to be a positive one overall. Gaining greater self-understanding is always satisfying, especially for you,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
