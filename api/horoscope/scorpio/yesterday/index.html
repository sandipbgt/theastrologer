    "horoscope": "You want, you need and therefore you shall have. It's as simple as that. Who would refuse someone as charming as you? What big-ticket items or bargains-of-a-lifetime could possibly elude you? The answers to those questions are no one and nothing. Expect your collection of people or objects to grow today.
