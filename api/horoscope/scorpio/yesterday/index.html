    "horoscope": "It's OK to be a snob when others are boasting about their dastardly deeds. Cruelty and force just don't do it for you. But this would be totally the wrong time to stand on your soapbox or even imagine that you could argue the point in a civilized way. Why would you want to get these barbarians mad? Instead of trying to make them see the light, keep your distance. And if they're your friends, maybe you should rethink your standards for friendship. What was cool yesterday can get you into hottoday.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
