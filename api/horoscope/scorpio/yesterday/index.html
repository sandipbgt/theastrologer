    "horoscope": "Strange ideas and interests consume you today. You might be drawn to people or subjects you've never considered before. If this marks the beginning of a fresh path for you, that's a good thing, especially since you tend to stick to the same routines of thought and action instead of branching out into the unknown. Just make sure you aren't dabbling in taboo subjects purely for the sake of shock value.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
