    "horoscope": "Tenderness reigns today. You want to connect with people you love, and you don't mind whether it's on your terms or theirs. You just want to feel that sense of togetherness. You're in a strong place emotionally, but not everyone is right now. You might end up being someone's source of nurturing care. And that's okay with you. It's nice to feel needed, and even nicer to respond to someone's yearning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
