    "horoscope": "Make an extra effort today to play nice. You're in a competitive mood, which can easily translate into aggressiveness if you aren't careful. It's easy to feel challenged now. In conversation, if someone disagrees with your point of view, you might get combative because it's hard to remember that differences of opinion are natural and normal. Instead of being hotheaded, do your best to keep your emotions in check, especially your temper.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
