Better yet, your heart's involved too, keeping you functioning smoothly as a whole and holistic being. You're feeling softhearted and friendly, ready to connect with others. At work and among family and friends, you can now inspire cooperation on your own terms. Use this gift to get everyone working together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
