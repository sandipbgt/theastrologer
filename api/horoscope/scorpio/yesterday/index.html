    "horoscope": "You're introspective, and maybe even a little bit confused as you try to figure out an issue at work or in a relationship. But any contemplation now may lead to inaction. It would be better to engage thoughtfully with the world. Just don't be surprised if you don't hit the right note on the first try. Conversations with friends or coworkers could get a little tricky as you work out the kinks of the problem or project. If that happens, don't worry. There may be a little mild friction, but then you'll be accepted.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
