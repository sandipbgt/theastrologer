    "horoscope": "A shy mood descends today. Your passionate soul cools in the face of a list of tasks you need to accomplish. Every part of you senses that it's time to get down to business. The good news? You don't mind. You might even welcome the chance to focus on a job you would normally put off, because it's so tedious. So work hard and enjoy the resulting sense of accomplishment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
