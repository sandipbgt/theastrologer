    "horoscope": "Today, you're aware in a very grounded way of how lucky you are to have the life you lead. This awareness makes you more than willing to do whatever you need to protect yourself and your loved ones, in any way that applies. That might mean working hard to bring home a good paycheck, or seeking a better job. It might also mean doing fix-it projects at home or cooking a balanced, nutritious meal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
