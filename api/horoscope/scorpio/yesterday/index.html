    "horoscope": "Gatherings of any kind, whether for business or pleasure, should go well today. But if things get tense, you can be a part of the solution instead of the problem. You have a natural understanding of human nature, and great insight into people's feelings. Use those now as tools of negotiation. If you understand where someone is coming from, you're well positioned to make a meaningful and mutually beneficial compromise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
