This may be hard today, especially when you seem to have a better grasp on cause-and-effect than most people. They might get in your way, thinking you're trying to steal the show or give away the store. OK, what you're trying to do might look bad. But as long as you're actually fighting the good fight, don't give up. Things will get easier soon, and you want to be in the sweet spot when they do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
