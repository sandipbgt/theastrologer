    "horoscope": "Many folks are feeling fragile today, and you can help with that. A sense of being emotionally grounded enables you to treat others with great compassion. Even if normally, someone's weakness or neediness might get under your skin, now you understand that these are just human feelings -- ones you experience, yourself, from time to time. That insight allows you to respond to someone's vulnerability with the strength and support they need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
