If you try to get a real dialogue going with your sweetheart, best friend, or business partner, your good intentions could fly out the window as things degenerate into petty bickering. If this happens, retreat and give it a rest for a while. You've never been good at backing away from intensity, but it might be essential now. Wait until everyone is feeling a little more levelheaded, and try again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
