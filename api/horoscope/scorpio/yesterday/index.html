Today you're quiet and contained, maybe because they finally did get your point, or because you don't have any burning desire to influence what's going on. It's OK to turn your energy inward now. You deserve a little rest. You could certainly use the space to develop your next project, whatever that's going to be. Find new ways to make things flow along your preferred channels. Let the strength slowly build up until you're ready to be a real presence again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
