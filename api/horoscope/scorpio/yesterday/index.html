Right now you're grounded enough to know your own strength, and you're tuned into the right kind of wisdom. Your experience, and listening to someone whose stories matter to you, can direct you. Either way, always know where you are and when you're in danger of crossing the line. Work wonders with your light touch today. Also, that tactile experience goes well with sensuality, and you can never get enough of that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
