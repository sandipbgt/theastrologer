    "horoscope": "Raw energy pulses through your veins today. Though normally you're a planner, now you're much more impulsive. Hasty words or deeds could lead to problems, especially in formal or professional settings. It's important to maintain your positive connections with your clients or employer, not to mention your friends, coworkers or spouse. It may be a good idea to get a vigorous workout, to burn off some of that excess energy!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
