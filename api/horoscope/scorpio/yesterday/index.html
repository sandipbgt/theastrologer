Now you can forget any discomfort you may have had, and embrace your emotions. Today is all about sense and feeling, so get ready to revel in the subjective side of your life. Inner truths will be revealed to you. Pay attention, and take notes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
