    "horoscope": "Your relationships should be mutually beneficial for everyone involved. Rivalry shouldn't even enter the equation. With that in mind, focus on getting an intuitive sense of your partner's needs today, whether that's a business partner or a romantic one. They'll appreciate your careful, considerate attention -- and they'll be more likely to return the favor later, when you need a little extra care. See? A conciliatory mood benefits everyone, and it makes you feel good about yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
