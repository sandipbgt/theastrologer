    "horoscope": "Relationships could get tricky today. A possessive urge is prominent within you. Like many people right now, you might feel a sense of ownership over your closest friends, your sweetheart or your spouse. If so, this makes it hard to avoid possessive behaviors and feelings. If you notice yourself getting uptight when someone you love seems too independent, consciously loosen up. They're a separate person. And that's as it should be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
