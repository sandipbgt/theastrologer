    "horoscope": "People know that when you're in a mood, it's best to just stay out of your way. Your anger often needs a vent, so you might seek out some person or situation that will let you express it -- even if you'll only have to apologize later. Maybe it's smarter to avoid those remorseful post-argument scenes. If you storm out in a spiteful huff, why not stay out for a bit to cool off, and then return and apologize?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
