    "horoscope": "It's a great day to visit someplace new. Or, if you can't afford the time or expense right now, start planning or dreaming of a vacation you might take in the future. Cast your mind far and wide. You're open to new experiences and people. You actively want your horizons to be broadened, so pursue that as a goal. Most of all, don't let anyone or anything limit your dreams.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
