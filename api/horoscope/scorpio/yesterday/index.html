    "horoscope": "If you push for anything today, push for harmony. Of course, you may not need that advice. You're already in a pleasant mood, and the idea of conflict doesn't sit well. You aren't one to make concessions that you shouldn't make, so there's little risk now that you'll let someone take advantage of you. Instead, you'll send them the important message that you'll do what it takes to get along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
