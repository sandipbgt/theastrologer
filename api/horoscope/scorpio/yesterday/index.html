    "horoscope": "You've always had a strong protective urge, both toward yourself and the people you love best. But for now, you need to draw the line between justice and revenge. Your focus should be on stabilizing people and situations, not upsetting them -- no matter how much better lashing out might make you feel in the moment. In the long run, it would only make things worse, and in your heart of hearts, you know that. So take deep, calming breaths today, and try to inspire everyone around you to do the same.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
