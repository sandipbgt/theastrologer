    "horoscope": "Be discreet in your dealings. You should still be consistent, though, especially in how you treat people. It's as important as ever to be fair and show others respect. Good thing you're up to the task today. Since you're sensitive to subtle emotional cues, you can stay in the good graces of anyone who matters, even as you surge ahead toward your own goals. Don't forget the people around you and don't operate solely from a place of self-interest. You're far more effective with allies by your side, Scorpio.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
