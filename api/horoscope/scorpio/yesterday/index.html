    "horoscope": "Affection comes easily today. You're in touch with your ability to charm others. You can sense instinctively what will make someone laugh or pay you the attention you want. That's one of your talents as a highly intuitive person. Just try not to spoil that sweet, close mood with stubbornness or jealousy! It's all too easy to get a good connection going but then muck it up with bad behavior.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
