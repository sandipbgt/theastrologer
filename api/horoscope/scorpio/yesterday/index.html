If this occurs, remind yourself that the other person is just being curious. Lots of people are especially interested today in any little detail that comes up. But you might feel as if they're being too inquisitive for your comfort. Reveal what you want, and hide the rest. It's your prerogative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
