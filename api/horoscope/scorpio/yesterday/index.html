    "horoscope": "Taking yourself too seriously today would be a mistake. Yes, other people may seem silly as they giggle and chitchat their way through the day. But sometimes it's good to lighten up. You tend to have a naturally deep focus. Why not go surface-level for a while? Trade jokes and quips with your coworkers. Blow off some steam. Then you can dig deeply again into your project, past, emotions or what have you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
