    "horoscope": "You're private by nature, but you're also a people person. You need warm, emotional contact with the people you love and trust. If your best friend or sweetheart seems emotionally unavailable today, don't take it personally. This is one of those days when most people are busy with their own thoughts and projects. If you feel lonely or isolated, seek out a group, or concentrate on enjoying your own company.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
