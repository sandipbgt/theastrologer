    "horoscope": "You've got the eye of an artist, or maybe an engineer. Either way, you're creative, and you're interested in how things work -- the behind-the-scenes operations that make people tick, or that keep a relationship or a business up and running. Systems both simple and complex fascinate you. Your mind is sharp. You can get a lot accomplished in this state of integration, which doesn't come around that often.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
