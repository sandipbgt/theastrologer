    "horoscope": "Today a big part of you wants to feel appreciated and respected. This might be an urge for professional recognition, but it's likely to stem from a more personal source. The current cosmic energy is the kind that stimulates your deepest feelings of insecurity. If some part of you feels inadequate, that might come up now. If so, face it, so that you can let it go. Remind yourself that you're loved by many.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
