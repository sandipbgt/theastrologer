    "horoscope": "Your intuition is strengthened today. Compassion and love are even stronger now than usual. That's what enables you to tune in so deeply to the people around you. It's easier to understand someone if you love them, or at least feel some sympathy toward them. This puts you in the perfect position to help someone with heartfelt support or advice. If someone needs your strength or input, give it without reservation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
