They could really use the type of support and compassionate advice that you can provide. Best of all, you don't even need to be told how others are feeling. If someone close to you is worried or upset, you can sense it almost as strongly as if you feel it, yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
