    "horoscope": "Your dreams are vivid today, and they may be hard to distinguish from reality. And that's not a bad state of mind to be in. In fact, it's a highly creative one, as long as you focus on your good dreams instead of bad ones. Even simple acts like reading a poem or watching a TV show are more fun than usual, because they open your mind to a world of possibility.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
