    "horoscope": "Teamwork is highlighted today. Discuss some ideas or plans with your partner or coworkers. Their input can only help. Everyone is in a highly creative mood, so brainstorming sessions go even better than usual. And you're more open than usual to other people's ideas. This is one of those days that reminds you that you aren't an island -- no one is. So gather with your people. Make something good happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
