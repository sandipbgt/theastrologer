Soon you'll have to keep on making them bigger, louder and crazier for people to notice. Why do you need a larger-than-life reality anyway? There's already enough drama in the world. And if you feel like it's your job to entertain everyone, go for something that makes them happier instead of just amplifying their problems or giving them new ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
