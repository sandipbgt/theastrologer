    "horoscope": "Whatever you do today, don't be a prima donna! Of course your own wants, needs, and perspective are important, but other people have equally important views. And being puffed up and full of yourself will only lead to making premature choices. Try to be less self-centered during this brief but potentially uncomfortable time. There's more happening here than meets the eye,, and you're sharp enough to figure out what it is -- that is, if you behave like a humble observer rather than an arrogant tyrant.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
