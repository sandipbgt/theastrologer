    "horoscope": "A competitive spirit arises within you today. Whether you're exercising, playing a game, working on a professional project or anything else, you want your strength and intelligence to be recognized and rewarded. And you probably deserve that recognition. The only problem is, many other people are in the same mood. And you aren't usually one to back down when there's a fight, even a friendly one! Stay humble today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
