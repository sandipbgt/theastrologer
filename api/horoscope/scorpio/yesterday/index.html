On the other hand, maybe you'll take charge and stir things up just because you can. Toes may be stepped on. Yes-men and teachers' pets may be thrown out on their ears. But remember -- what goes around comes around. If you don't want to be a victim next time, don't be a bully this time. And a day of soul-searching might be just what the doctor ordered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
