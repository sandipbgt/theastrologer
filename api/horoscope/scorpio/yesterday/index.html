    "horoscope": "You have a pleasant sense of emotional stability today. No matter what's going on in your life, you're on an even keel. You're able to view even tough situations with a reasonable eye. You enjoy being the passionate person that you are, but sometimes it's nice to set emotion aside so reason can prevail. This enables you to see small details and logical flaws you might have missed otherwise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
