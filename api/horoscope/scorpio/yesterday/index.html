    "horoscope": "Your personal relationships could get tricky today. There's a cool, aloof vibe in effect that gets under your skin, because you're all about connection. You crave intimacy with the people you care about. If you sense someone close to you withdrawing or holding something back, you're likely to push until they relent and reconnect. But it may be wiser to let them do their thing and trust them to return when they're ready.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
