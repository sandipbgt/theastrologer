    "horoscope": "You may not admit it -- you can't stand admitting weaknesses, even to your closest friends -- but you're feeling vulnerable today. This might be a specific worry related to your work, your finances or your future, or it might be a general feeling of anxiety that casts a cloud over the whole day. Try to avoid emotional eating or lashing out at loved ones. Do some deep breathing and write in your journal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
