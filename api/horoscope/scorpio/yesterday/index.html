    "horoscope": "Persistence gets the job done, and you've got that in spades. Be careful of using too much force today, especially with people you care about, or those you'd like to impress. Back off a little. Maybe you could work off some of that excess energy and increase your general flexibility at the same time, through exercises like yoga or pilates. Sweating out your irritation is a good idea any day, and even more so now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
