    "horoscope": "Normally, you love a good mystery, just as you love operating behind the scenes and surprising everyone when they find out what you've been up to. But right now, being secretive just doesn't feel right to you. Today, you could be rather short toward anyone who happens to get in your way. But while this kind of response may feel great in the moment, it won't accomplish much. Remember, other people have perspectives that are just as valid as yours.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
