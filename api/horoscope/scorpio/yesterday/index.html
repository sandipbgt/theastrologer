    "horoscope": "You've got a lot of energy today -- maybe a little too much, in fact. You're apt to go off at the least provocation, because your emotions are riding the current energy boost, and the result is like a roller coaster. You're extra passionate, and you know that can go in many different-- some positive, some challenging! Be mindful of your feelings, and try not to overreact toor insensitivity from others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
