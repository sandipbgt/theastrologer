But don't make the mistake of assuming you already know everything. You can learn from every situation and the same is true for people. If you want others to like and admire you, draw them in with warmth, charm and an attitude that show's you're willing to learn.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
