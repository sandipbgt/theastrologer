You're gathering lots of information and storing it away for later use. You're also tuned in to the people around you. If a friend or a coworker is feeling sad or worried, you can sense it. This is a good time to counsel others. You understand their feelings and you can offer important insight.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
