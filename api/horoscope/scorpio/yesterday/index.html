    "horoscope": "Today could get a little crazy. In fact, some level of chaos will be hard to avoid, because you're feeling pumped up and just a wee bit out of control. It's all too easy now to let your temper flare. If that happens, try not to make a bad situation worse. Calm yourself immediately. Take a walk around the block if you have to, or count slowly to ten -- whatever works to bring yourself to a more normal range of feeling and expression. Then focus on the good in your life, and find ways to make it better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
