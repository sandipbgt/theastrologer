    "horoscope": "The past to the present to the future -- it's a long continuum, one based on a mixture of tradition and innovation, equilibrium and change. You're deeply aware of this continuum today. It brings you a sense of stability to know you're building from the past, whether you're trying to move away from certain experiences or retain them as a foundation for your future. Enjoy this deep, pleasurable feeling of rootedness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
