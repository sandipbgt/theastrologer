    "horoscope": "You're a natural administrator. Most people recognize that you're the boss, and they won't hold it against you. They might even do what you say, although as the big cheese you now have the responsibility of picking up whatever the slackers missed. Yes, there's a timeline to watch, a process to follow and a place for every little thing, but don't sacrifice your chance for fun. The gods of work can be forgiving taskmasters if you see the loopholes in the contract. Schedule yourself a day off the clock, OK? You know you deserve it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
