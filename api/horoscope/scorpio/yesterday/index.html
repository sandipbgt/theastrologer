Even if you're in an industry that thrives on ruthless behavior, it's clearly the wrong place for you right now. Today will challenge you in other ways, whether spiritually or in some test of character. Beat those challenges back by working together. And if you're truly alone, jump into these tasks one by one, and do your best as a lone warrior. Whether or not you succeed, you'll grow. And isn't that what it's really about?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
