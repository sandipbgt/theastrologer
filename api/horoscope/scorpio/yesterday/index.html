    "horoscope": "It's important to be thick-skinned today. Otherwise, the world could really rub you the wrong way. Lots of folks are in competitive moods now; to you, their actions could seem downright ruthless. People might make insensitive comments without realizing the impact of their words. But you may also be more sensitive than usual to slights both real and imagined. As much as possible, give people the benefit of the doubt.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
