Cutting out the excess, either literally or figuratively, enables you to get down to what's really important. Take advantage of this opportunity. It's a great day for anything from launching a new, healthy diet to balancing your checkbook, and all sorts of things in between.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
