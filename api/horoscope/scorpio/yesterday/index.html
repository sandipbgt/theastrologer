    "horoscope": "It's what's inside your head that really counts now. Give yourself permission to buy, sell and trade in the economy of knowledge. Absorb whatever comes freely. Respond to offers that praise your ego without insulting your intelligence. Each new challenge makes you feel brave even if it isn't that hard. That's because people believe in you and will bend over backwards for you, assuming you'd do the same for them. If what you have in your heart matches what's in your brain, you'll have a powerful day to grow in this environment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
