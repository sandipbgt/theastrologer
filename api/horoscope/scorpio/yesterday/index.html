And though work may not be your top choice of activities, it's nice to feel this grounded. Sometimes life is like an emotional roller coaster, but now, you're even-keeled. Immerse yourself in your work. Tackle your duties with energy. Get the job done so you can get back to your hobbies and loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
