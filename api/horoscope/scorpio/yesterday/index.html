    "horoscope": "Lack of focus is rarely an issue for you. You're generally able to concentrate -- sometimes even to the point of obsession! But today your focus is at just the right level. Turn a sharp and practical eye toward your work. Assess what needs to be fixed or streamlined. Emphasize efficiency and functionality. At the end of the day, take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Ah -- satisfaction.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
