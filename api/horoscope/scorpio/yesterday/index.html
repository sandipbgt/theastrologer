    "horoscope": "You're extra big-hearted today. Your own problems recede as you tune in to other people and their needs. You're in the mood to help anyone who needs it, on any level. But your strongest area now is giving emotional support. You have a lot of warmth and tenderness to offer, but your undeniable core of strength will protect you from anyone who might think to take advantage of your kindness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
