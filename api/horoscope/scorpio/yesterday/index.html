Take a few moments to envision your goal. Hold the image of it in your mind's eye, and let yourself feel the satisfaction you'll experience when you achieve it. This brief meditation will help you guide yourself toward your goal more truly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
