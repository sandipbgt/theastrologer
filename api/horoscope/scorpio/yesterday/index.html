    "horoscope": "Today, you're drawn to unusual people, places and ideas. Or course, many people are thinking more creatively right now, and exploring your own inventiveness is never a bad idea.

But respect others' privacy, and think twice before dabbling in strangeness for its own sake.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
