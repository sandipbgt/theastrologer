    "horoscope": "You're careful of other people and their feelings today. You can sense their emotions at a deep level. You can also tell when someone is feeling sad, hurt or sensitive, and you genuinely want to help them. The level of understanding you're able to offer now could really make someone's day, especially if you tap into your inner counselor. You give great advice, because you really understand what makes people tick.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
