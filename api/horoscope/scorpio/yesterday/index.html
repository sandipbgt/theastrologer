    "horoscope": "It's hard not to feel a little moody today. The phone keeps ringing. Emails pile up in your inbox. It's hard to concentrate on one thing at a time. If work just isn't, well, working, try a different approach. Divide up your duties into several smaller tasks. Make it a personal challenge to get as much accomplished as quickly as possible. Keep interactions with other people short and sweet. That will help you stay positive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
