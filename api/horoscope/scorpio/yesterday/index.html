    "horoscope": "Your interests and tastes turn toward the decidedly unusual today. It's good to delve into new subjects, including ones that challenge your sensibilities. Just make sure you aren't getting in over your head, or courting something purely for shock value. You've always been drawn to darker subjects and emotions, in your quest to understand yourself and human nature. But chasing oddities for their own sake is a waste of precious time and energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
