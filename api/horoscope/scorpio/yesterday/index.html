    "horoscope": "Everyone around you seems bent on small talk today. You want to talk, too, and trade ideas, but mindless chatter annoys you to no end. It's a good day for a deep, heart-to-heart talk with a trusted friend, or a session with your counselor.

Don't keep secrets today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
