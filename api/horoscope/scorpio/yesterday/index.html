    "horoscope": "Your inner performer comes out for a show today. You gravitate toward the spotlight. Part of you really wants the attention, that rush that comes from having all eyes on you. But if you feel ignored or as if someone's trying to steal your thunder, it's easy to overreact. The current cosmic energy has a way of stirring up insecurities even as it stimulates self-confidence. Share the spotlight gracefully.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
