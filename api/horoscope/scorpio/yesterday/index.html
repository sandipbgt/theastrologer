A customer appreciation day at your place of business would also be a lot of fun for everyone, or an impromptu lunch out with coworkers. The important thing is to spend time with the people who mean a lot to you -- those same people you may sometimes take for granted.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
