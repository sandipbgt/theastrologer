    "horoscope": "If you're working on an important project today, try not to get distracted. If you attempt to tie in too many different pieces from all over, your superiors may accuse you of doing a slapdash job. If that happens, don't get upset when they want an explanation. Stay cool, and explain yourself as best you can. Tread carefully -- your communication isn't great at the moment. But maybe you can get through to them, which will help you feel a little less misunderstood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
