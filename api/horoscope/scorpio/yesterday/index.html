    "horoscope": "A deep sense of compassion softens you today. Tuning in to other people's feelings and problems has always been easy for you. But now it's more than just an interesting lesson in human nature. Now you care deeply about what they're thinking and what they need, and you want to help them if you can. Today your friends and coworkers can see what a big heart you have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
