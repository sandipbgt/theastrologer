Suddenly you feel rough-edged and ineffective. The wrong words just come flying out of your mouth -- or maybe they're the right words, just at the wrong time. Focus on what's bugging you and talk it out if you can. If not, just wait it out and things will soon get back to normal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
