    "horoscope": "A flush of new energy flows over you, one you can feel deeply in your body. It's time to rededicate yourself to yourself. Get back on that diet or exercise program. Eat your veggies. Clear the air in an important relationship. Do what you know is right, and within a month you'll notice a remarkable difference. There's no one who understands self-improvement better than you do. Now's the time."
