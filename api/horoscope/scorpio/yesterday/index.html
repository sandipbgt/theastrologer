    "horoscope": "You can learn a great deal about yourself, your work or some other important aspect of life today. Traveling and staying home can be equally good. Both familiar and strange settings let you puzzle and ponder the nature of the universe. Whether you're at home or on the road, carry a pen and journal with you, so you can record your thoughts. Any bolts of clarity that strike now should be treated as gifts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
