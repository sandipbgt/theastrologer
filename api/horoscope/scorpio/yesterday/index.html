The trouble is, you might not come across as wise or mature, the way you intend. Instead, people could see you as bossy or immature. Try to adopt a 'live and let live' attitude. It's okay if you don't feel like joining in the fun, but let others get their kicks.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
