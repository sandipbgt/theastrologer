Just don't let too much sober reflection throw a wet blanket over your sense of wonder. You have enough energy to become an active player, instead of standing on the sidelines offering commentary. But once you're in, ride today's changes instead of trying to control them. See where this thing ends up. Even if you have a stake in the outcome, you're going to win. One way or another, you always do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
