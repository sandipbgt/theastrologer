    "horoscope": "You feel everything deeply and keenly today. Affection and anger both take on a passionate intensity that may exceed the actual situation. Needless to say, this could be incredibly enjoyable, or it could be extremely difficult. It's easy now to make a mountain out of a molehill. Do your best to avoid suspicion, jealousy and other heavy emotions. Stay trusting and lighthearted, so you can tap into the positive side of this influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
