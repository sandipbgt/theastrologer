    "horoscope": "Today, you're motivated by passion, which isn't really anything new -- and it's understandable that you want what's coming to you. But sometimes, self-restraint and humble endurance are far more effective for getting what you desire. Your usual tactics -- pressure, intensity, focus, pursuit -- are likely to make today's red tape and traffic jams even worse. You have to be patient -- in the not so distant future, you'll be glad you restrained yourself. For now, seek a fun or functional distraction, such as a quick, impromptu trip out of town or a thorough overhaul of your finances.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
