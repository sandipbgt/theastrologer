Arguments and other conflicts do more harm than good now, unless you can find a way to talk things out in a fair-minded way. In that case, make sure all parties involved feel heard, understood and respected. Then you stand a good chance of working things out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
