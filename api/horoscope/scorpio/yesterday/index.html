    "horoscope": "You're feeling vulnerable today, and you hate that sense of insecurity,. It might not be a bad idea to pull in your resources and guard your flank. Show a little backbone, while you're at it. This is all about defining your physical boundaries and keeping them safe, so be both strong and sensible as you set your limits. Of course, that also means not being overly self-protective. There's a difference between strength and bullying, just like there's a difference between weakness and intimacy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
