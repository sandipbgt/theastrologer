    "horoscope": "Your challenge today is to relax and appreciate what you have: The people who love you, the talents and skills you've developed, and the things you've worked for that make you proud. Simple appreciation of the world where you live is the best way to tap into today's vibe. But this could be hard to do if you're caught up in angry or insecure feelings.
