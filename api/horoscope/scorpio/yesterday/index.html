    "horoscope": "You're extra aware today of how much you rely on the people you're close to. Whether it's a personal connection or a professional one, there's someone who means a lot to you. Let them know how much you appreciate their presence in your life. You don't have to do this in any overt way, like buying them flowers. It's more meaningful to find a way to show how much you value their input.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
