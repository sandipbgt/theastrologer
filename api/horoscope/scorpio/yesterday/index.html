Do be selective, however. You may feel incredibly focused, but even the sheer force of your will isn't enough to cover every single base all by yourself. Instead of spreading yourself too thin, focus on what's important, and go from there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
