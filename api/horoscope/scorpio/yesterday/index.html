Taking the broad view is a great thing to do from time to time. It gives you perspective. You can learn so much just from looking at the big picture for a while. Then you'll know what to focus on when you get back to the intense, complicated elements you deal with on a regular basis.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
