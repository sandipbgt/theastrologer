    "horoscope": "Tact matters more than intent today, so watch what you say and how you say it. Your focus should be on preserving the harmony of your relationships. Go with the flow,- don't be too independent or make a fuss. Not everyone can appreciate your latent talents at the moment, so be careful about sharing your secrets. Soon, the time will come to push your own agenda more forcefully. For now, let others know you're here to work with them, not against them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
