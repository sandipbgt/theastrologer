But today, any attempts you make at small talk could devolve quickly into embarrassing moments that you won't forget anytime soon. You might decide the universe is against you, but this would be premature on your part. Maybe it's that you aren't coming across as genuine. Try broadening what you say, and stick to the bare, honest truth. That's what people want.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
