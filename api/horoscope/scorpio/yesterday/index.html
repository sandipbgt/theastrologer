    "horoscope": "A new personal cycle begins for you now. Determine a goal you'd like to accomplish in the next month. But keep it to yourself, at least for now. You can talk more openly about it when you have a plan that's fully formed. Until then, err on the side of discretion. If people ask you about new developments, just smile and tell them you're working on it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
