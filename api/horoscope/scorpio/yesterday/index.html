You think you're seeing clearly, when really you're viewing your life and relationships through a filter of unconscious feelings and needs. Remember that before you renounce the old ways. It would be far better to wait a few days before making any major decisions, because things might change in the meantime, starting with your point of view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
