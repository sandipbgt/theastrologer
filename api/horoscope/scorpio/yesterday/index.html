    "horoscope": "Your passion is right at the surface today. How will you channel it? This is an important question to consider, because if you don't tap into it consciously, you'll do so based on instinct -- and that's what could bring trouble. For you, passion is emotion. When your feelings are stirred up, you have to be careful about how you express them. The current energy could have you jumping to conclusions prematurely.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
