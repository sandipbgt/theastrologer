    "horoscope": "You're in a deeply emotional space today, in the best way. Your connections with loved ones provide you with great emotional sustenance, and you're willing to return the same level of affection and devotion. It's a wonderful day to spend time at home, or anyplace where you feel comfortable. Time with friends and family is a blessing. You feel deep, boundless gratitude for the relationships that sustain you. Revel in these emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
