    "horoscope": "You might fantasize about striking out on your own, but today it's even more important than usual that you work on your partnerships and commit to group efforts. Control the impulse to run off and do your own thing. Instead, focus on getting along with the people you're closest to. Unity will be critical for the next day or two; keep that in mind, especially if you get annoyed with how things are going. Remember, you were meant to be a part of this group.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
