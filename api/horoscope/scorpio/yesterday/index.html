    "horoscope": "You feel unusually tender and softhearted today. Love and even romance flow easily now. Or you could soften on some issue that's been making things tense between you and someone else. If you're on your own, you can turn that kind, gentle attention toward yourself by indulging your creative side. You can also simply enjoy a day of rest and relaxation, and gear up for more energetic days ahead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
