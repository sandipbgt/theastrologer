So it's time to make the decision to wrap up old business, once and for all. If you don't, who will? Not many people are as focused and directed as you are, especially right now. It's time to move to something new and promising. Make it happen today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
