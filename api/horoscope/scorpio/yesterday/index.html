    "horoscope": "Your friends and loved ones mean a lot to you, and it's a good day to let them know that. Under the current influence, they probably need some extra affection. You could use a warm hug and a heart-to-heart talk, yourself. Or maybe a dinner party or going out dancing is more up your alley. Either way, enjoy the company of someone who is very dear to your heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
