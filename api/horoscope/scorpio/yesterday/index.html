The truth is, there is no reason for it; write it off as the energy of the moment. But knowing that doesn't help much; you're still feeling irritated, ready to blow if anyone gets in your way. There's a better approach, however. Reinvent your world, from a place of happiness instead of irritation. You're a master at change and manipulation. Put those skills to good use. You'll feel better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
