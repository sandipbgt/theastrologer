    "horoscope": "Today you're drawn to unconventional people and subjects. The weirder, the better! It's fine to dabble in strange pursuits, even if you're simply attracted for the sake of strangeness itself. Just avoid making any major decisions based on a need to be seen as unusual. The people who know you already know that you march to the beat of your own drummer, so you have nothing to prove on their account!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
