There's little danger of taking on more than you can handle, because you're quite realistic about the limits of your time, energy and abilities. This makes you something of an efficiency expert!

That quality will come in handy under today's cosmic influence, which emphasizes proper behavior. It's easier for you than for some people to fall in line with others' expectations.

You generally take a more organic, holistic approach to life, one that leaves lots of room for adjustment. Now, though, it's more important to get something right the first time.

In fact, maybe they should bother you more! It's possible to overdo it under the current influence. You might get bogged down in details and fail to recognize when enough is enough.

Pretending to be proper might irritate you, but it's better than the alternative. It's no fun to be criticized because you made a crude joke, so save it for another day!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
