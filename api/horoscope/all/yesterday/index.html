Imagine how you'd feel if someone came at you with this kind of criticism. Are you still convinced that your feet don't smell because you walk on? Maybe that's the problem. If you want to be clear on the concept, clean up your act today. There's always room to improve. And you'll feel a lot better about these people if you can all do it together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You'll learn a lot today if you make an effort to blend in with the crowd. This goes totally against your nature: You're all about being yourself, no matter the consequences. But cooperating with other people teaches you what they want, what they need and what makes them tick. A big part of this, of course, is being a good listener. You're used to commanding the conversation, but in work situations or with friends, try to give others the stage. That will enable you to work together instead of at cross purposes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your employer will appreciate the way you speak both kindly and candidly to a new client. Well-chosen language allows you to give freely and endlessly, you know. It's one of the few gifts that costs you nothing, yet can make an enormous difference in other people's lives. So don't be stingy!
