Once you're in it, it'll make so much sense. Just keep that wild enthusiasm flowing, breathing in the inspiration of your perfect world. Whichever way you push, there's no resistance now. See how long you can make it work for you. Once you look back in amazement at how long this glorious chunk of 'now' has lasted, then that business with the calendar will start making sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

As always, it comes down to a question of money, whether it's a personal budget or shared finances. So you should be considering the difference between thrifty and cheap. It's all about how you react to expensive circumstances. You could be wise or you could be mean. Which do you think makes more sense? Don't be small-minded about your goals. Review your saving graces today. You're actually rich in that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Today is all about improvement and enlargement. Maybe it's your mission to leave a bigger footprint in the landscape, but there will almost certainly be consequences for this. These could happen in the natural world or in your community. Watch out for conflict. Some people might see your expansion as provocation. Be tolerant of their boundaries, even if your way is obviously better. If they don't agree, go around them instead of through them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Who is this saboteur knocking down everything you worked so hard to build? For a day or two it's as if you don't even know yourself. If you hope to make peace between these warring internal factions, it starts when they all sit down to talk.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your arguments are a lot more powerful than usual, and your methods are more subtle than anyone expects. Gently but irresistibly sway others to believe in your ideals. You'll be incredibly convincing today, thanks to the solid proofs you'll offer them, and to your future-forward attitude that could make a believer out of anyone. Just by telling the truth as you see it, you can build the biggest and best team yet. These people will take what you give them and run with it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

This could mean surrendering the battle that's taken up so much of your energy in the last weeks or months. Maybe it would mean eating your words or drinking the Kool-Aid. But you know what? Everyone gets to be wrong sometimes, and everyone gets the opportunity to change. So maybe it's time to step over your hard line. Rethink your loyalties.

You're happy to sing that airy, distant melody from somewhere outside the spotlight, in the wings, or even from a different building. You're not about to get in anybody's face, but you wouldn't have a problem if they came looking for you. It's intentional yet effortless, a sincere belief in pacifism mixed with the ease of not wanting to bother.

Of course, you've never been much of a joiner, which is an important part of your charm. Try a new twist today. There's such a thing as creating your own destiny, you know.

For today you can give without fear of losing. Sure, your supply might dwindle down to nothing, but you'll feel better knowing it's for a good cause.

What's visible now is all part of the plan, and you still have options. But you need to stay strong and be careful about what you choose. Work within your safety margin.
