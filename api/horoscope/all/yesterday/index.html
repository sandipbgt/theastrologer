Thus, you might let someone else take the lead on a project or in a decision that affects you directly. If it's something important, set boundaries or take a stand as needed. Harmony is valuable, but you have to stand up for yourself, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
