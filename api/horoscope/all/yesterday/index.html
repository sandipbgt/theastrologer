An evening out with someone special is sure to rev your internal engine, but if you're single, even just going to see a romantic comedy with a buddy gets you in a good mood. Or staying home, lighting a candle and cooking a good meal, or watching the moonrise... There are plenty of good ways to invite romance into your life,.
