        "horoscope": "Right now it's all too easy to jump the gun in a snappish moment. Any tense situations at work or at home will need to be carefully navigated. Restrain yourself, despite the strain of how unfamiliar that feels. You don't like limiting yourself, after all. But right now, it's more prudent to hold your cards. If you let others know how strongly you feel about something, they might disagree just to be contrary. But don't worry: Things will be back to normal soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You're hardly known for your thick skin. Quite the opposite, in fact: Your friends love you for how sensitive you are. Developing a more durable hide might be today's important lesson for you, however. For instance, if someone is nasty toward you, don't dignify them with a response. The path of least resistance is better than wasting time with hurt feelings, or flaring up and starting a fight. And who knows? Perhaps you were just feeling overly sensitive. Maybe they didn't mean anything by it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

That way, you can make a more informed decision later, one you'll be sure is the right one.

That can come later, when you're more certain you have others' support. For now, play this carefully, like a high-stakes card game: Keep your cards close to your chest and your expression neutral, and track your opponents' every move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
