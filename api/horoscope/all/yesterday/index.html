But like many people, you may be vulnerable to melancholy or insecurity now. If so, treat yourself gently. A bit of pampering isn't out of the question. Nurture yourself with a midday snooze or a sweet treat, or spend a few hours on the couch, indulging in a good book or movie.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's a good time to deepen your connections with the people you love, because you're in an affectionate and demonstrative mood.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
