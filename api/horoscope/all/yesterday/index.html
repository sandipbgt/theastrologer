This could be tough, since it means committing to cooperating with others, even if you believe you have a better idea in mind. But it's good to stretch yourself in this way. Emphasize getting along and respecting the needs of the group. Challenge yourself to be as forward-thinking as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This might mean lending a hand in someone's project in a physical way, but it's even more likely to occur in an intellectual realm. Your strength right now is in finding new ways to revamp old systems. You bring real creativity to the table, so put this skill to good use.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
