Dive into the breach with grace and confidence. If anyone emerges as the winner, it will be you. Of course, you might have to settle for a partial victory, but that's okay. If you have fun with the back-and-forth, it won't be a complete waste of time.

Since you're feeling materialistic and a bit desperate, your first instinct is to get your hands on something -- anything -- that might soothe you. A longer-lasting approach is to review your boundaries and stay resolutely within them. That way, you won't have anything to regret.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
