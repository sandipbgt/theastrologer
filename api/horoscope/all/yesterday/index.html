You can actually get a lot done if you put your shoulder down. Focus on work, and show your boss how dedicated you are. Most of all, make sure you're moving toward a specific goal. That way, slings and arrows will bounce right off your hard shell. And don't worry -- you'll definitely know when the worst is over(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
