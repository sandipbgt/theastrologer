And isn't it nice to be grounded in your physical senses once in a while, instead of awash in emotion? Enjoy this state. Get in touch with your body. Imagine your feet taking root in the ground like trees. Stretch your thoughts and feelings up to the heavens.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're drawn to valuable items now, so anything you do purchase is likely to be of good, lasting quality. Just make sure you really need it, and that you can pay it off in a timely manner.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Like many people right now, you might feel a sense of ownership over your closest friends, your sweetheart or your spouse. If so, this makes it hard to avoid possessive behaviors and feelings. If you notice yourself getting uptight when someone you love seems too independent, consciously loosen up. They're a separate person.

It's in that centered, satisfied feeling that comes from smiling at a coworker or a stranger on the street. It's in the gratitude you feel when connecting with someone you love or sharing a meal with your family. Having plenty has little to do with money, and you're deeply attuned to this truth today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
