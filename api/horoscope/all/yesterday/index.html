It's difficult to get much accomplished. The drier your work is, the harder it becomes! No, this isn't very practical. But what are you going to do about it? Sometimes, you just have to let your mind wander where it will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You may feel a little moody today. Life seems bittersweet, especially if you're dwelling on the past. Lost love is a consuming subject for many people right now. This includes idealistic notions like true love -- the perfect relationship you could never have, since you made it up in your imagination. It's okay to indulge in this kind of fantasy, but remind yourself that reality has so much more to offer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's easier than usual to pick up on subtle cues and signals from your environment. You're ultra aware of how the people around you are feeling -- perhaps more aware than you want to be!

You just want to give back, because you know you're blessed! Try not to overextend yourself in terms of time, effort or money.

You might get caught up in a pretty fantasy about what could be. That's fine as long as it doesn't lead to disillusionment when you realize there's a wide gap between fantasy and reality.
