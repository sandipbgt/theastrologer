        "horoscope": "Offer someone your wise counsel. Your special insight is quite extraordinary, you know, especially at the moment. Someone could really benefit from the way you view business or friendships, and anyone who understands your genius will soon be following your example. Don't let the idea of that make you uncomfortable! Today brings you the unique opportunity to make a difference. Take that opportunity and run with it. There's nothing to be nervous about; if you put your heart into this, only good can come of it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Hey, are you hungry yet? Because right now would be a totally appropriate moment to sit down for good food with good friends. It doesn't matter if there's something else on the schedule. Even if this is a job interview or a first date, you'll all have a fine time. Friendly relations are sure to thrive today. It's only natural that your natural goodness will shine through.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

People can't help noticing you, whether they're choosing up sides for a team or working the room in search of a date. You can turn simple transactions into deep conversations if you want to. But whatever you do with this special status, milk it for all its worth today. You deserve as many friends and allies as you can get. You'll actually need all that help if you want a fast-forward boost toward some distant goal. Why not get yourself a little closer?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But this one-day window could be decisive, especially if you're self-employed, a solo player, or otherwise the master of your own fate. Pour your efforts into something concrete. Produce a small miracle and push it out the door. Then go back inside and crank out another one while you still can. Maybe you never thought you'd kick into assembly line mode, but clearly it's time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're a strange little island poking out of the mainstream, and you seem to be getting more visible all the time. Don't be one of those people who try to conceal what's obvious to everyone by now. Don't bristle if they're more curious than polite. And whatever you do, don't withdraw your unusual self from the market. Flaunt what's peculiar about yourself today because, like it or not, that's going to be your biggest selling point.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You can be anything you want today, even if that means contradicting what you were yesterday. Why not try something different? Amuse, surprise, shock or blind-side those who thought they knew you. That includes you, too. When you set yourself up as a master of the unexpected, you'll open the door for learning and growing experiences. Don't worry. It'll be as fun as you let it be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Well, you could try, but your best bet might be something more radical. Withdraw from the situation for the day and see how it looks from the outside. Or you could turn your back and walk away. That may seem harsh, but if you drop some emotional baggage and lighten your load, you'll find that it's totally OK to move on and start over.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

For instance, why do you favor isolation over communication? You're just asking a cold, lonely day if you keep walking those deserted paths while everyone else has already found a place inside. But it's not as if you're miles away. You're only separated from them by a wall of your own creation. Reach out right now. Step through one of those open doors.

You're dashing, autonomous, and free to go -- well, probably nowhere, by the looks of it. This could be an inconclusive day. You'll impress people who ultimately won't matter, build sandcastles that the next high tide will wash away, and generally spin your wheels. Try not to waste all your talent and charm here. Save it for something important in case you find a way out. Oh, and start looking for that escape route now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But even as you squint and grin in the glittering spray of the moment, you should be paying attention to the small things that are getting swept away. You'll hate it later if you couldn't find where you left them. So take a snapshot, sketch out a map or use whatever little trick works to keep things fixed in your memory.

Soon, you'll know whether your results are worth publishing. If so, they'll be yet another entry on your lengthy list of accomplishments. If not, it's no problem: You'll have gained valuable information that you can use next time to make your work a real success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Today you could get sucked into someone else's bawdy, tawdry or awful drama, if you refuse to look away or if you're crazy enough to think you deserve a piece of the action. Don't go there. Because that story will look a lot less fun from the inside. Come on. If you're no stranger to personal soap operas, you should know this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
