The truth is, you aren't there yet -- but with a little more effort, you will be. If you're working with a budget, be sure to stick to it. That'll impress higher-ups once this thing is in the bag, and it's time for your review.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Do what you can to keep the discussion light, because now's the time for fun and flirtation, not heated or heavy confrontations. You may even be better off simply creating something from the heart. Your instincts are true today, so follow them. Put brush to canvas, pen to paper, or fingers to strings, or connect in a nonverbal way with a certain attractive someone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Right now, you're the person strangers spot on the street and think, 'Why can't I have that kind of energy?'

Your anger often needs a vent, so you might seek out some person or situation that will let you express it -- even if you'll only have to apologize later. Maybe it's smarter to avoid those remorseful post-argument scenes. If you storm out in a spiteful huff, why not stay out for a bit to cool off, and then return and apologize?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Try to focus on just one. If you can't figure out which is the right one, ask a trusted friend or colleague for their input. It's likely that you aren't seeing the situation as clearly as you could be. A little outside perspective might make all the difference.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But maybe it's time to deal with an insecure mood in a new, more effective way. Instead of whining over what you don't have, try appreciating what you do.

You've got adventure on the mind today, and getting out is more fun than ever because your angle is truly independent. This brand-new perspective could really take you places -- at the very least, it'll provide a day of diversion. When you come home, you'll share what you found with anyone who's interested.

If you've been missing one-on-one time with your sweetheart, ask them out on a date, or cook a romantic dinner at home. If you've been skimping on alone time, take a long walk, go see a funny movie, or take a nap. Any of these should help you feel more happily centered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
