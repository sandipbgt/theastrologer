It feels as if everything is just slightly out of your control. And you do enjoy feeling as if you have a firm handle on things. But maybe this is a good opportunity to experience a different perspective. Don't judge or even process your emotions. Just feel them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
