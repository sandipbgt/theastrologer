But try not to hurt anyone's feelings. Reducing a certain issue or situation to a clever quip can take the emotion out of it, and the humanity, too. These are real people involved, you know, with real feelings. Use yourself as comedy fodder.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Best of all, if your boss catches you in a distracted moment, it's easy to think on your feet and come up with a charming excuse! Use this talent sparingly, though.
