Exploring unfamiliar locations is one of the best expressions of the current energy. But reading up on an interesting subject works, too. So does trying out a new restaurant or seeing a foreign film. Find some way to broaden your world view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You might wish people would just follow the rules, or adhere to your expectations. But rules were made to be broken, and expectations were made to be challenged! Do your best to get into this playful, rebellious energy today. You could end up discovering a carefree side of yourself that you'd forgotten you had.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Sometimes you just have to bust out! There's a deliciously freeing, joyful feeling that comes from surprising people -- especially if you surprise yourself, too.

And it's perfect for, say, brainstorming a creative project. But don't become too attached to any one brain wave just yet. Things are still developing. Even a firm philosophy could shift dramatically in the next day or two. So stay open to brilliant ideas, but avoid committing, for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
