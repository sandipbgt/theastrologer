You might think you see their side of things, but you're just seeing what you want to see -- which helps no one. Whatever you're pushing for, try setting it on the back burner for now, so you can make a sincere effort to connect with your partner's true needs or feelings. This shouldn't be too difficult, since you're empathetic and connected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
