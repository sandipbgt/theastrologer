If you can reconcile this independence with working with others, you'll have it made. Gather a group together for a project of some kind. Brainstorming with others yields truly creative, progressive ideas. And at the very least, it's just more fun than working alone!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
