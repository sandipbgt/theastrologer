        "horoscope": "Impulsive moves could misfire today. Reality is a bit unclear, and your outlook isn't very practical. Ideals seem to hold more truth than anything concrete. It may take some time to determine the viability of a certain project or pursuit. The good news is that you can bounce back quickly from any problems. If you realize your goal isn't going to work out after all, you'll simply switch to a newer, better one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Your best qualities emerge today: your patience, your warmth, your generosity. You have a kind word for everyone. Any tension that may recently have been affecting a relationship evaporates. What's left over? Just peace, harmony and togetherness. Connect with loved ones and really pay attention to them, using more than just your eyes and ears. You have an intuitive streak, and it will come out today if you tap into it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Your escapist tendencies are heightened today. You rarely like being pinned down, since you're too energetic for that. But now, you just want to bypass the demands of your everyday life. The more responsibilities pile up for you, the more you'll fantasize about turning your back on all of it. So why not claim some alone time? It's a great day to keep your own company and pursue quiet, low-key activities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "A tranquil mood sets in today. You're always generous with the people you care about, but now you're especially unselfish. Drawing a bath for your child or cooking a meal for your family -- tasks like these nurture yourself as well as others. You're softhearted enough to listen to a friend's problems with great compassion, and sturdy enough to give them the advice they need. This is real emotional balance,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You're famous for your pride, as well as your lionhearted courage. But today, you're feeling unusually sensitive. Careless words and actions get right under your skin. It's unlikely that anyone is trying to hurt your feelings, but it certainly feels as if they aren't being thoughtful enough. Try to remember that any remarks that you find hurtful were probably delivered with the best of intentions. Summon that inner strength,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "The harder you try to stay focused and organized today, the more chaotic life may seem. Perhaps an efficient, logical day just isn't in the stars. Try paying closer attention to your feelings, and to how your friends and family are doing emotionally. You might find that you were using logic or busy work to mask your feelings, or to avoid an emotional confrontation. But facing things is much more effective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But imposing order is difficult now, too. Your body is trying to tell you something: It's time for some rest and relaxation! Get some extra sleep, or build in time to zone out with a bubble bath or a good book.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Or you could soften on some issue that's been making things tense between you and someone else. If you're on your own, you can turn that kind, gentle attention toward yourself by indulging your creative side. You can also simply enjoy a day of rest and relaxation, and gear up for more energetic days ahead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And if you're parked at a computer all day, the urge to doze off might be even stronger! Get a midday nap if you possibly can, or get to bed early. If you're feeling moody or nervous, yoga or meditation can also help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're feeling tender and compassionate. If someone needs your strength, you can sense it, and you genuinely want to help. You're practical enough to keep your personal boundaries in place, too. That creates the perfect balance of helping others while protecting yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

There's no need to throw yourself into strenuous pursuits now; you'll only tire yourself out. And if you can't seem to make a decision, it's probably because there are still too many variables to mull over. Give yourself permission to withdraw today from anything fast-paced or challenging.

The time you spend letting your thoughts wander can actually be quite productive. No doubt your boss will be happy to learn this! Let yourself fantasize about the future. You can manifest your dreams later, when you're feeling more focused.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
