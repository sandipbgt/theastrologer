Rise to the challenge by tuning in to the bigger picture and painting a broad perspective. Right now, people understand philosophies and theories better than details. They want concepts, not the fine points. And you know just how to deliver.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Let this natural enthusiasm inspire other people -- but try to avoid overwhelming them. You wouldn't want to hold yourself back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
