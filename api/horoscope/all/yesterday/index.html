Right now it's not about recognition -- it's about taking quiet pride in your efforts without announcing them. Ordinarily you thrive on compliments and awe, but this time, the satisfaction of a job well done will be all the positive feedback you need. You can share your methods and successes with others after you've savored them privately.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
