Just watch out today for the urge to splurge. You've been on a buying binge lately, and you're probably still working to catch up after shelling out for gifts and going out to dinner with friends. Try to be practical today when something catches your eye.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Traditional approaches to problem-solving appeal to you even more than usual, because you have long-term security in mind, and you just don't trust any methods that aren't tried and true. No, you may not shine today as an innovative thinker -- but you've got something better to offer: common sense and a splendid work ethic.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Sometimes it's good not to look too deeply into things -- as foreign as that may sound to you. This is one of those times. Relax and enjoy yourself.
