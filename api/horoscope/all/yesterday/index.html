Just go with your heart. In fact, it's a great day for romance. See a mushy movie with a friend, or give your sweetheart a hug. Let yourself dream a little. Days like this are perfect for indulging in sweet imagination.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Napping is good, too -- especially if you keep a journal by the bed, so you can record your dreams when you wake up. You may notice that both your dreams and your feelings are more vivid now. If you pay attention to them, they could reveal something interesting and important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
