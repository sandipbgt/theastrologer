Speaking of which, you're in quite a playful mood, keeping things light with friends and coworkers. Silly, flirty exchanges, whether in person or via email or Instant Message, are a lot of fun. Just make sure they don't get in the way of getting something accomplished!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Seek out the right people to discuss important subjects and ideas. Just a few well calculated conversations could get you on the road toward a new goal. Of course, simply chatting with friends and strangers is fun now, too. You may even be in the mood to get your flirt on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
