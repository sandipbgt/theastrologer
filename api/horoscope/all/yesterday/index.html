        "horoscope": "You have no trouble being upfront with people, but for today, be kind to them as well. Remember, you're in this together with everyone else -- friends, coworkers and strangers alike. Try to see things from another point of view; maybe it'll help you drum up a little compassion or understanding for the other guy. This may come as a shock to you, but you don't always deserve to have your way! Since you're here to make peace, not trouble, do your best now to get along with everyone you encounter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Wake up, be aware, adapt and oblige. Oh, come on, why not? Today, it won't cost anything to be nice. The universe is even kicking in a few bonuses. For instance, this is a relatively painless way to open the door for wisdom. Well, it sure beats learning these things from the school of hard knocks, wouldn't you say? Plus, knowing when to put on the company manners will give you a good basis for future contact, whether you're looking at romance, business or social networking.

        "horoscope": "Well, check you out -- you're throwing yourself into the game and playing like a pro. You don't get tired, and your perfect strategy and coordination are almost spooky. So, to what does everyone owe this honor? They asked for a little input and suddenly you hit the ground running. You're quick enough to oblige when you have something to gain from giving. A concealed motive might be OK today. After that, though, you'll need to speak up.

        "horoscope": "Promoting yourself might look like a vanity move. Following your passion might seem excessive when everyone else is just sitting there frozen. As far as they're concerned, you're going way over the top just to make a few simple improvements. Why should you care what they think? Because they could be right about using too much to do too little. Would it really cramp your style to save some of this for later? Take it slowly today, just to see how that feels.

        "horoscope": "OK, lose the sweet talk. You made your point. Even decent, kindhearted people are getting restless. Now you get to release some of the edginess you've been quietly absorbing. The world needs a little tension to hold it together, because otherwise everything will droop and melt into a puddle of syrup. Speak from the id for today. Greed, lust, scorn and pity are all OK in moderation. It's all part of being alive, and last time you checked your pulse and breathed on a mirror, you were definitely alive.

Don't make it worse by kicking yourself because you didn't see it coming. Visionaries should look into the near future for a glimpse of their so-called good idea once they're actually committed to it. Don't upset the apple cart when your hands are already too full to juggle all those falling apples.

You're just being cautious, checking things out from a distance and deciding whether you really belong here. Maybe you're easily embarrassed right now. Or maybe you just got a whiff of some psychic allergen that always messes with your brain. It could be that you're a romantic with enough self-awareness to sense a pack of wolves just around a corner that you're not going to turn. You're feeling susceptible to harmful influences. It's perfectly OK to remove yourself. It's important to know your limits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If there are any surprises today, you want to be the one to spring them. Just don't be surprised if others don't agree. You're not the one who makes the rules, you know.

If they're making this many demands on you, they obviously don't care that much about you as a person.

Sometimes you'll be too shy for words, but other times you'll have the world's sharpest tongue. Nobody knows what you'll do next, not even you! Instead of hoping everyone has a short memory, start giving them a reason to forgive you. Because why would you want to be forgotten?
