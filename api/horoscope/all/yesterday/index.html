        "horoscope": "You're a passionately opinionated person. Today, you may find yourself arguing with someone over the best way to pursue a project or a cause. Instead of getting upset and digging your heels in, try to listen to the other side. It's likely that everyone involved wants what's best for the group. Finding common ground is important now. Working together is so much more effective than stubbornly going it alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Making a close, warm connection with others feels difficult today. You're seeking a sense of familiarity, but it's hard for you to relate to people. They're caught up in odd theories or activities that make you anxious. But why reject people or ideas just because they seem strange? Instead, try to view uncomfortable conversations as learning experiences. Whatever makes you nervous reveals a lot more about you than about them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You're a leader by nature, and perhaps one by trade or position as well. But today it's important to ask for input from other people, even if they're less experienced or knowledgeable than you are. Make everything you do a team effort. Getting other people involved makes them feel as if they're a respected part of the group. And any good leader knows how important team-building exercises are!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And now you can come up with a really creative idea for a certain project, something no one else has thought of. Pursue it, even if people think it's strange. With your natural confidence, you can gain their support. Soon, they'll start to see the method to your madness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Doing innovative work brings you a wonderful sense of discovery. And don't listen to anyone who claims your ideas are too out-there. They obviously aren't as tuned in as you are!

And team efforts actually work out better than solo ones now. Why not get involved with whatever your friends are working on? With your strong back and excellent work ethic, you can certainly be of help. And working side by side makes you feel closer with them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But don't reject a person or theory just because it seems strange. Inspect your own feelings of discomfort or mistrust.

Just make sure you aren't getting in over your head, or courting something purely for shock value. You've always been drawn to darker subjects and emotions, in your quest to understand yourself and human nature.

This applies whether you're at work, at home or just hanging out with friends. Whatever you're up to, have fun with the mental workout this day brings!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
