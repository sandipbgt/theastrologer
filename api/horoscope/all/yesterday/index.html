You could visit someplace you've never been before, or talk to a person whose background is completely different from yours. It's good to open yourself up to different perspectives, especially if it makes you uncomfortable. A broad-minded attitude will keep you learning, and will help you avoid becoming inflexible or even judgmental in your thinking.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Instead, tap into your healthy store of ambition. That'll push you where you need to go -- out of the house, or at least out of your ordinary existence, and toward something fresh and inspiring. Today could spark a whole new way of life for you, but only if you're an active participant.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You may have to work for their recognition, and that's OK -- refining your product or approach will only help in the long run. By the time you have your say, you'll know it by heart, and you'll dazzle everyone. You won't even need to say 'I told you so' -- their praise and support will be reward enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

No matter how badly you want it, no matter how entitled you feel, don't reach out and take anything without getting permission first. Some self-restraint is in order today, despite the fact that you're all about indulgence. Resisting the urge to have that person or thing you desire could be a really good life lesson.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If someone extends an invite today, consider that they felt every bit as nervous about approaching you as you feel about accepting. Then accept. You'll both feel immediately more relaxed. Then you can move on to the hard part: deciding whether or not you make a good fit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If their source is something ongoing that you can't escape -- like the day job -- maybe it's time for a break. Can you get out of town anytime soon? Take a short road trip, or get yourself to the nearest beach and chill out.
