On the one hand, you love being spontaneous, and you're better than most at thinking on your feet. On the other hand, taking things a little more slowly gives you that all-important sense of harmony with your environment. Strike a balance between daring acts and ones that are planned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And if anyone or anything stands in your way, you aren't afraid to get a little pushy! That's how much this means to you. Still, it's important to realize that some people may take determination as insensitivity. If you're working on a team, make an effort to be gentle, especially when issuing feedback or direct commands.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The current energy is impulsive in nature, which could make folks speak without thinking. It's easier to step on people's toes when you aren't aware of your effect on them. Of course, considering your nature, you're more likely to be the one who's grabbing your foot and saying, 'Ow!'(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
