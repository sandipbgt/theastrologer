You might as well surrender what you can no longer camouflage. You're probably just imagining the whole thing about suppression and conformity. Yes, you're different, and people might be a little put off or jealous about that, but you don't have to play the game.

Try to make a real decision other than the obvious resolve to escape at the first opportunity. Stick around for a while. Dare to assert yourself today. Take the risk of nudging reality onto a slightly different track. Once you volunteer for that responsibility, your life could instantly become richer than you ever imagined. There's nothing to compare this to if you haven't already experienced it. Just commit to making the effort, and then you'll see.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

So start taking full responsibility for your life. Start showing some pride in what's uniquely yours. And one more thing -- own your work ASAP.

You deserve a little rest. You could certainly use the space to develop your next project, whatever that's going to be. Find new ways to make things flow along your preferred channels.

All the good stuff comes out in quiet discussions and lingering glances. Be sure you talk a lot today. And be sure to keep your eyes open, too. There's a lot you can do with a single melting gaze.

Someone's future or reputation is at stake, and the slightest whisper of a scandal could bring it all crashing down. Don't think you're immune, either.
