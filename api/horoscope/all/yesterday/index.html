        "horoscope": "'Forgive and forget' is an important motto to remember today. Everyone's feelings are aroused now, so they feel more sensitive. And you tend to react without thinking. If someone hurts your feelings, you might let them have it -- and then wish you hadn't. It's important to stay calm now and give people the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they're feeling sad or lonely. More likely, they meant no offense at all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
