After all, if you're working with your spouse or colleague to arrive at some mutually agreeable decision, you have to represent your own needs as well as meeting the other person's. At the same time, try not to make too many waves. It wouldn't do to alienate the very people you're supposed to be cooperating with. In the end, an even keel is best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

With your natural energy, you can keep the whole group productive and lively. Just don't let this go to your head. You're a natural leader,, but if you try too hard to become the captain, others might start resenting your position of power.

You're setting a good example now; maybe you'll even teach someone how to be more tolerant. But teaching is not your main concern at the moment.
