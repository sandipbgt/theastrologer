But know that any practical jokes you perform today could quickly boomerang, coming right back on you. Surely you aren't actually laughing at others' discomfort -- that wouldn't be like you at all. Reconnect with your gentle self. Otherwise, you could really wreak some havoc in your relationships, and you'll just have to clean up the mess later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
