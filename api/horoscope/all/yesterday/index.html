        "horoscope": "Toning down your anger doesn't seem like a huge challenge today, but just because you don't express it openly doesn't mean it isn't there. It's just not obvious. Of course, there's still plenty of stewing and brewing going on inside you, and soon you'll feel more open about expressing it. So stay in touch with your feelings, but rather than opening your mouth, open your ears. You don't have to accept everything people say.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That feeling could be intensified today, as you're especially inclined to hide things from other people for no other reason than the fact that you don't want to divulge anything. There's probably another person -- someone intense -- who would like to share something with you. Depending on what it is, see if you can work something out. It would benefit both of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And instead of excitedly telling everyone you know about your new discoveries, you keep the information to yourself. This allows it to mellow, giving your mind time to absorb it. Then you can carry it even further, once you truly understand its importance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
