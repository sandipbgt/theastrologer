You're affectionate but brisk. You'll speak your love with an honest, open heart, but you won't necessarily hang around to prove it. Your natural talents are calling you elsewhere today. People can expect a light touch and easy harmonies from you. If you're expecting a relationship problem waiting for you when you get back, you'll deal with it then.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Someone in the bunch might surprise you by turning out to be far more unusual and interesting than you expected. Even without any such pleasant surprises, you'll be glad you put in the effort.

If you don't want to become obsolete, boost your tolerance for new things. Your logic about all this might be flawed, you know. Rise above your conditioning and maybe even your principles.

Even if you're not somebody who lives to serve, you can do it well enough when you have to. Today might even qualify you for cheerful sainthood.
