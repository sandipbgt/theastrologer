        "horoscope": "It's a good day to look inward and inspect your emotions, especially if a certain thought or feeling keeps coming up and won't go away. Where does it come from? What brought it on? These are good questions to ask yourself. Talking to a friend or counselor about your feelings is also a smart move today. Or, write in your journal. That way you can process your complicated thoughts over time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Delving into memories and emotions is incredibly revealing now. It could even spur some creative writing or another emotionally expressive project. Though you normally prefer to keep things sweet and harmonious, don't shy away from your own dark corners today.

Or maybe you're facing your own inner demons in some way, and getting all mixed up over them. Either way, resist the urge to retreat!

Minor comments seem bigger and more upsetting than they might on a different day. It's important to keep your cool.

Doing so is sharing your very soul -- the best, most personal gift you can give to a friend. They'll want to do the same, too.

It's a great day to discuss complex emotions or interpersonal situations. You can give good advice to a friend, or offer them your support in some other way. Better yet, dig into your own feelings.
