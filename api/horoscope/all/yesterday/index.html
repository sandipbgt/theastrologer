When you're in the grip of divine inspiration, everything's cool and anything goes, whether that means passionate one-on-one time or standing alone on a mountain somewhere. Of course, your inner condition will be obvious to the outer world. Who could miss something like this? And if others come along to bask in your bright light today, will you complain? What a concept! Just savor whatever happens to you, and you could see some long-term life improvements start happening in the short term.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Show off on many different levels to hold their attention. Express yourself through actions as well as words. Put a little spin on your story so that it won't get tangled up with anybody else's. It's your day to really and truly make your point. But don't kill the conversation by turning up the volume. The secret to being a team player or an attractive force is making others feel special, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Well, how would you know that when you jump each time someone moves in your direction? Aren't these people supposed to be your friends? Lay off the caffeine today. Get more sleep and exercise. See if all that helps you lower this impossibly high bar you're still trying to hurdle.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're going off the beaten track even if you already know that won't get you there any faster. Well, it's a style, if you want to call it that, but not everyone will face the same challenges this way.

Keep the magic going with the firm belief that everybody's your friend and no one would dream of hijacking the party for their own selfish purposes. Maybe you'll be right this time.

Speak without accusing, and if you can't do that, don't speak at all. These are useful exercises in self-control.
