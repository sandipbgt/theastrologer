But whatever you're facing and however you handle it, you won't be the only one coping with this stuff. Your neighborhood or workplace might be affected, too. Rough times can make people snide and stingy, but you don't have to be part of the problem. You may already know how to solve it. Give graciously and they'll follow your example.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's entirely possible that today, you'll be sad that things didn't turn out differently. But the truth is, it simply isn't worth the fight. Take a step back and let things go.
