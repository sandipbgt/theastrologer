        "horoscope": "It's still okay to be proud. Pride can help define who you are. Don't become stuck up, though. Don't delude or spoil yourself. Maybe there's no one exactly like you, but that doesn't make you better than everyone else. Today could easily rob you of what you so vainly possess, if you go around challenging other people's pride. Watch out. Don't confuse the present with the past. Stop reacting to things that happened long ago. Keep your personal history in its box and keep your senses in the moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Today you'll be skeptical and impatient. You'll try to get a laugh at other people's expense, and it'll just make things even worse if you end up laughing alone. You'll try to guide development and growth with an iron hand, making rules no one else ever heard of. Forget that -- it won't work. Even if you wrapped it in a velvet glove, you'd still have a hard sell. Bottom line? Brute force isn't an option no matter how you dress it up. Try compromise instead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Everyone knows how smart you are, so don't think you need to prove it all over again by being pigheaded about your point of view. Getting stuck in one perspective won't help anyone, and you could look like a snob to people you like and respect. Isn't it better to agree to disagree, at least today? You know other people's ideas are just as valid as your own. Take some time to keep reviewing the facts and going over your options.

But making people laugh isn't enough, even if you bring every ounce of your creativity to your stories -- and even if you enjoy being center stage, for once. Don't you want to go a little deeper than that? Pursue a real connection, whether it's a romantic connection or just an intimate bond with someone you deeply love.

Also notice that your goal will start looking a lot closer today. As much as you approve of how you're doing now, don't let your ambitions and desires eclipse your friendships. Your companions are part of this whole adventure, too, and they deserve their share of the light and heat you'll be putting out.

Because why waste any of this good energy on stupid formalities when you could be thinking outside the box and capturing a much bigger audience? Yes, you might be having the time of your life with whatever it is you do best, but you ought to have a plan for locking it into your future, too.

They all want a piece of what you seem to represent, and boy, do you make it look attractive. Watch, though, that no one takes you for granted. If someone tries to take advantage of the fact that you're so ready for anything, simply take a moment to redraw your boundaries.

You're all too aware of that fact -- still, don't let anxiety affect your health. Relax, take deep breaths, and trust your instincts.

That's a good thing, too, because today, you're all about telling rather than showing. Is this out of laziness? Probably not, but even if it were, no one would mind.

Today is bristling with possibilities, and if you hope to rub up against some of these things, you need to make yourself available.

In some meaningful way, things you've always taken for granted now come true, and you're able to wow everyone with all the things they've forgotten in their own lives and hearts.
