        "horoscope": "You've always been solid at your core, and that's what people are attracted to. Keep that in mind now, because though you're feeling energetic and ambitious, this may not be the time to let that energy loose on the world. Excessive vitality could all too easily undercut that solid foundation of yours. At the moment, people just want to know you're dependable -- they're not looking for you to be vibrant and enthusiastic. Similarly, instead of striking out in new, observe your ties with the past today. They'll help define your future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "It's hard not to flirt today. You want to be part of everything, whether it's to satisfy some driving passion or just have a little taste. If you're the life of the party, it's because you're wise and introspective, not because you look like an-head. Well, there is a lively part of you. But whatever social skills you deploy, whatever your angle of approach, it will be up to others how involved they'll let you be. Don't take rejection personally. There has to be someone else just as wise who still wants you around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

No, you're actually feeling quite aware, in tune with the world and excited about the possibilities that today brings. Take a look inside your heart, and you'll see that you know just what to do during this charmed period. Remember, you're as timely and adroit as ever, and multitasking is a particular skill now. Use it well: Focus on a project or goal that really means something to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You'll make the right decision, as long as you hold off on making any promises until you're really clear on things. For now, enjoy that feeling of wonderment that borders on confusion. At the moment, there's no need to know the answers -- it's still a little too soon to be certain. Just explore the questions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

In this case, you may have to pay a price if you can't navigate carefully. But that's just the part you can see. Don't get too sloppy with all the undercurrents surging through your experience. You might overflow your boundaries today, flooding other people's acreage with something too rich and extreme for them to handle. Clouding these waters won't help anyone see the light.

You're using your sharp insights to let some hotout of those who dare to fly their balloons too high. Yes, it's easy to criticize when you feel morally superior. But think about your audience. Are they laughing at you, too? Are you more of a clown than a critic? With so many different perspectives, the same joke isn't always funny for the same reasons.

Connect and merge with those who'll accept you, rather than storming the gates of places where you'd never fit in. Is it really OK to rely so much on those  moments of ecstasy, discovery and bonding? You'd hate to turn into just another experience junkie, because those people are like perpetual tourists, always looking and never satisfied. Climb outside of yourself to get a better view of who you are and why you desire what you do. Find kindred spirits today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Go for cautious optimism and sensible choices instead - in the long run, they'll get you a lot closer to your goals. You'll even notice minor benefits in the next day or two. And really, do you need everything all at once? You have enough of a sense of self-preservation to wait it out -- just trust that you'll get what's coming to you.

Aside from the fact that time travel doesn't exist, stagnation and regression aren't nearly as appealing as they might seem. This mood you're in will pass soon, thank goodness!

Live your life, greet your neighbors, hang with your friends. They'll know something is ready to pop, but your carefree attitude will drive them crazy.
