Of course, if there's tension at home or among your loved ones, that may not provide much comfort at all. In that case, do your best to be a peacemaker. Talk things out, or at least soften the tension with kindness and humor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

An issue might arise at home that needs your input, or an old friend might call. Attending to your duties close to home brings you satisfaction now. So does reconnecting with the people who are dear to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Of course, words will probably be involved! But telling someone you love or support them is even more powerful when you back it up with action. So give a friend a hug. Call a relative you haven't spoken to in a while. Offer someone encouragement, to help them through a rough patch.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
