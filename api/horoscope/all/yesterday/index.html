Your best bet is to laugh off any sticky situations that arise, and tap into the passionate side of this energy. This can be romantic or creative passion, or even passion for a book you're reading or a course you're taking. It's up to you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you're immersing yourself in a creative work or a healthy relationship, then have fun with the intensity of feeling. But if you're feeling drawn toward someone who isn't appropriate for you, remind yourself that feelings change quickly.
