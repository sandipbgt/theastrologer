You don't mind unpleasantness or bad behavior, as long as it's real. Still, avoid unhealthy or destructive people. That includes self-destructive behavior like spending time with anyone who doesn't treat you with caring respect. Honesty doesn't have to be painful! The best interactions now should be deeply compassionate and healing in nature.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
