        "horoscope": "The best thing about you now is that you're faithful to your ideals. Your mind and eyes are sharp, your grasp of morals and principles strong, and you're tuned in to a larger truth. This means you can enlighten your friends and associates, especially if you keep telling it like it is. No one's going to argue with you. They all recognize your connection to a higher reality, and they're willing to listen to your perspective, especially if you offer ideas to make things better for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Pure happiness shifts into utter joy. The world seems like exactly the right place to be, and you're at the center of it, dancing to your very own melody and simply enjoying life. Today you're a superior being -- not in the sense that you're above other people, but that you're tuned in to your own inner light. You're at your best and brightest now, and you can illuminate the world around you. You may even find you have followers -- people who admire your enlightened movements and want to follow your lead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Suddenly, it's as if the world has turned into chaos. At work,and responsibilities become overwhelming, and you just want to hide. At home, things may not be much better. If you're romantically involved, expect today to be confusing at best. You're feeling pessimistic and disorganized, which only makes things worse. Still, it's just your way of rebelling. This mood will pass,-- it always does. But try not to bury your head in the sand.

Whatever it is you're wearing or carrying around, it'll look good on you for today. Then what? Time marches on, wishes and demands change, and people will start judging old books by their covers. No, you don't have to give up what you love. But you might also benefit from having something more current in your life, too. Why not belong to a few different eras?

Bring your determination and concentration online until your world is humming with constant power. Focus all that energy on your objective today, whether you're trying to break a world record, win somebody's doubting heart or make your first million. Why can't you do all this and more? You feel like laughing in the face of the impossible. You know you're right, and you'll prove it, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Of course, you can use your innate compassion to soften the blow, especially if you have to reveal a harsh truth to a friend. Be as upfront as you can. By telling the truth, you'll protect your integrity, which is very important now. Later, a little exaggeration will be just fine. But for now, stick to the facts and nothing but.

Today, your warmth comes out, and your favorite people know exactly how dedicated you are. If the world seems a little cold and cruel, don't worry. Go ahead and put up your guard if you have to. Still, it would be better to give in to the strange, romantic energy and do away with being guarded altogether. Someone loves you a lot, and you can let them know you return the feeling.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Let your inner puppy or kitten come romping out that open door. Roll in the grass, the surf or the hay if it so pleases you. Flirt with an attractive stranger if it feels appropriate. It's all in fun, and it doesn't have to disrupt your organized life in any long-term way.

You know you've done some things well and others not so well, and you're looking forward to the chance to take a step back and see how you're doing. This is a great time to ask for assistance or feedback from a friend or colleague. It's a good idea to give your critics a warm welcome today.

Start pushing back at whatever is closing in on you. The good news is that you're still a long way from being trapped.

Shroud your personal life in the kind of modesty that deflects attention instead of the kind of mystery that begs other people to snoop around in curiosity. You'd just have to brush them off when they got too close for comfort. They'd think you were going back on your invitation, and there would be chaos and bad feelings. Make things easier for yourself, not harder. Know when to remain silent.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

There are a couple of ways you can handle this. You could let your inner nervousness build as you act aloof and cranky while you try to figure it out yourself. Or you could stay calm and ask for help. There's got to be an ally who can help you out, even with just a bit of fresh perspective. Ask and see.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
