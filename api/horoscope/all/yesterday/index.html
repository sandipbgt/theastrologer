Your focus is deep and the hours fly by. Before you realize it, it's evening -- and you've learned a great deal about yourself, your creativity or some other important aspect of life. What you learn could be complex, but it's also incredibly meaningful to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Even your bond with your best friend feels complex and compelling. Just don't be surprised if the other person is behaving strangely. Possessive, jealous or controlling behavior is common right now.

You might boast about your accomplishments without realizing it, which puts others on the defense -- and when they call you out for arrogance, it really hurts your feelings. The best you can do today is not to take anything too personally or too seriously.
