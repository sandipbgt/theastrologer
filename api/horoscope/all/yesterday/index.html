        "horoscope": "It's easy to get absorbed in your duties today, especially if you have a lot on your task list. But this could cause issues in your personal relationships, and even more so if you're naturally somewhat aloof. The current cosmic energy makes people less emotionally expressive. You might simply forget to treat your friend or sweetheart with warm affection. Fulfilling responsibilities is important, but so is connecting at that human level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You can move forward with confidence, because you know your projections are well founded. Anyone who might be observing your progress is sure to be impressed, but you aren't in this for the glory. The satisfaction of a job well done is reward enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The current cosmic energy favors a realistic view of your capabilities. Since you're interested in long-term security, both financial and emotional, it's a good time to strengthen that foundation in any way that might apply. Attend to details now, so you won't have to later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You tend to focus naturally on the standard that has been set or the rules that have been established, and under the current influence, that focus pays off. At the very least, your performance will impress your employer or set a good example for others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The current energy is just right for getting a lot accomplished, no matter how tedious or complicated the job might be. A methodical approach works best. It allows you to see any places where the process breaks down, so you can rework or revise, and move on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But it may be smarter to model your own behavior after theirs. This is one of those days when focus and hard work are favored, while boisterous behavior and inappropriate jokes aren't. Keep in mind that people are rather easily offended under the current influence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's important to stay grounded. Approach your work and other tasks methodically. Set high standards and then focus on attaining them.

This works well in plenty of situations -- attending to mundane business, for example, or constructing a professional or academic project. But when it comes to dealing with people and emotions, a different approach may be needed. Don't forget that rationality doesn't apply to feelings. Be open on more than the mental level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The current cosmic energy does highlight people's perfectionist streaks. But try not to let others' expectations cause you too much stress. The important thing now is to do your best, and be satisfied with that. Trying to exceed a reasonable expectation of achievement will just make you feel inadequate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
