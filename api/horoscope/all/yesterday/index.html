After all, it's not the guy who cut you off that's the root of the problem, any more than it's the slow lady in front of you at the grocery store checkout. And what's the point in being a martyr for a useless cause, anyway? Try putting your attention toward something more meaningful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Even if you're not in the right frame of mind to appreciate this basic truth, try not to generate any crises at work or among your friends today.
