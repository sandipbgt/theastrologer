It might not even be a big deal. Find a sympathetic ear, unload your problems until you get to their cause, and you'll feel a lot better.

Since you'll be more comfortable if you have some control over things, put your considerable energy into determining where in your life change is needed, so you can make it happen when the time is right.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
