Where someone else's emotional state might be like choppy waves crashing on a beach, yours is all calm waters -- serene to the core. Enjoy this state of being so in touch with your own heart. Reach out to others with genuine compassion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Or it might be in a way that's more about self-discovery -- talking about your memories as a way to learn more about who you are today.
