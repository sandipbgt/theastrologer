        "horoscope": "When dealing with other people today, it's a good idea to set aside both logic and reason, and connect with them on a purely emotional level. This could be tough for you to do, since rationality is your language of choice! But many people are in highly emotional mindsets now. And emotions, by definition, are irrational. Trying to reason through feelings or refute them with logic just won't work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your close relationships provide you with great emotional sustenance. Your hopes and dreams are vivid. This helps you envision the future as a beautiful ideal, not just a list of accomplishments you're working to achieve.

You're feeling especially tuned in to the emotional or even mystical side of life. Your instincts are on high.

It's almost as if your intuitive powers are heightened: You're able to tell how someone is feeling and relate to them at that level.

You tend to live in your body, so enjoy a day or two of living and loving from the heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
