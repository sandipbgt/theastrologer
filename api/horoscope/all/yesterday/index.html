This is a great chance to get a little romance cooking, if you're in the market, because you're extra attractive now. Plus, you possess the courage to approach someone cute and interesting. Any type of social or business engagement will be a success today. Accept any and all invitations, too, because you're a peppy ingredient to any mix. Hmm...does that make you the spice of life?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Today might feel like one uphill battle after another. Everything you think you want or need is just out of reach. Friends, coworkers and other people in your life with whom you're ordinarily close now seem to be on the opposite side of the fence. Is it an issue of perspective? If you keep on pushing against other people and their agendas, you could easily wear yourself out. Instead, stop and consider whether you're actually fighting for the right thing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Is fate playing with you? Intangible goodies certainly seem to be dangling just beyond your reach, tantalizing you, making you dream of something much bigger and better than what you've already got -- but don't leap just yet. Instead, take the time to learn what's real and what isn't. You'll probably find that those new, shiny options aren't all they're cracked up to be, and your own, personal status quo is all you actually need.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you've met with somerecently at work or at home, it's no matter. You're determined to make it happen this time. That shouldn't be hard, either, because you are coming at the world full-force, and no one has to wonder about your agenda. Get ready to take some great strides today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Something is pushing you toward impulsive, crazy acts. You're on edge, and your excess energy needs an outlet. Can you go for a nice, long walk or jog to burn some of it off? That would be much better than taking it out on your sweetheart or coworkers. If you do find yourself acting out, or even if you're just having trouble sleeping at night, start focusing on what's really bothering you. Then work through it in a calm, direct way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "When negative criticism comes your way today, you'll deal with it by tossing some stinging comebacks. The only problem is, what you're perceiving as negative might actually be constructive and well-intended. You've always been a bit on the sensitive side, and right now your skin is even thinner than usual. Chill out. Remember that your own anger could leave wounds on your friends, loved ones and coworkers -- anyone who happens to get in your way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Why the sour face? So something isn't working out quite as you'd planned. Being short-tempered will only ensure that you get the short end of the stick. It's a much better tactic to stay patient and flexible, as impossible as that may seem. Remember, self-restraint is its own reward now. Stand up for yourself, if you need to.

It'll get you through today, anyway, and that's saying a lot, because this probably won't be the easiest, most lighthearted day of your life. You're likely to face challenges at work and at home, and you'll need that strong will of yours to help you shove through tight spots. You'll also need your most diplomatic, tactful side as well.

And that's perfectly okay. Your dream will keep. In the meantime, put your energy into making the status quo as bright, shiny and exciting as possible.

This offers you yet another good way to manifest your preferred reality, so grab hold of any opportunities that arise now. They'll come quickly and easily -- you might not even recognize them for the lucky chances they are.
