        "horoscope": "There's a strong emphasis today on compassion. You might need a little extra understanding from others, yourself. If you're feeling a little off center emotionally, there's a good chance other people are, too. That's the current cosmic influence at work, making everyone feel things a little more deeply. Reason and logic recede as pure emotion takes over. Be kind to yourself and others until this influence passes!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If you can't envision your dreams, you can't bring them about in reality. But right now, disillusionment is possible if things don't pan out as you'd imagined. That's why a grounded sense of perspective is so important. It keeps your dreams alive, not to mention realistic.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
