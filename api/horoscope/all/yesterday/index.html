Perhaps someone close to you is feeling especially loving, or maybe they're in a gloomy state of mind. Or maybe you're the one who's feeling things much more intensely than usual. Either way, don't try to joke or rationalize these feelings away. Sit with them. Absorb them. Let them wash through you like.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But now, having to be bold or decisive could make you want to hide under the covers! Bolster your courage by reminding yourself that you have a lot of support to draw from. Lots of people adore you, and most are ready with a sympathetic ear if you need to talk out an issue.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Participate in activities that help you look beyond logic to the more magical side of life. It's also a good day to visit any place of reverence or worship that's meaningful to you, whether that's a church, a temple or a mountaintop.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But right now it's a good idea to make space in your schedule for some pleasurable relaxation. Grab a friend or a family member and camp out on the couch. Watch a movie or read a good book.

So keep biting comments and snarky jokes to a minimum! You might just be poking fun, but someone else could get their feelings hurt. And if you're the one who feels a little blue today, give yourself some space to sit with those emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

This might be a church or temple, but it could also be your favorite spot in the woods or at the top of a mountain. You, perhaps more than most, derive great meaning from natural settings that afford you a broad perspective on the world and your own place in it.
