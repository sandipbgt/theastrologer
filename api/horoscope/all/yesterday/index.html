        "horoscope": "Many people are feeling more nurturing and compassionate than usual today. For your part, you may be feeling more emotional, and more sensitive. It might even get on your nerves if someone seems to be coddling you. You don't want to be smothered! But if that happens, try to see their behavior for what it is. They're just trying to show you they care. Perhaps you could soften up a little and return the sentiment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
