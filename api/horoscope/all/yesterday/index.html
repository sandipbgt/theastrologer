It's important to be especially gentle with people under the current influence, since many folks are feeling a little on the fragile side. Be conscious in projecting warmth and concern, even if you privately believe that someone is being overindulgent with their emotions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
