Get a good sleep, go for a walk or a jog, or turn on loud music and sing in the car on your way to work. Anything you can do to blow off steam will help you through this brief, moody period.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Be sure to extend some of this warmth toward yourself, too. You deserve the kind of devoted kindness you're showing to others! Spend as much time as possible at home now, or with people you know intimately. Your current energy is best suited for familiar places and faces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You can do a lot to center yourself. Eating a good meal or watching a funny movie with a friend is a great distraction. But you can also take a more direct approach to easing your worries by addressing anything in your life that seems weak or imbalanced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This isn't a time for taking unnecessary risks or throwing your support behind something you know won't work out long-term. So use your head and tap into the wisdom you already possess inside you.

In fact, you might be feeling the same way. Your usual taste for exotic food and adventurous experiences is reduced. Maybe it's a good day to stay home with family or close friends, and revel in the comfort of familiarity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's good to keep a sense of perspective -- this is just a passing mood -- but at the same time, if something in your life needs to be strengthened or stabilized, this is a good day for that kind of work.

If a cranky mood sets in today -- if you find yourself snapping at someone for no good reason, or withdrawing from your usual group of friends -- look within yourself. What are you worried about that you haven't faced yet? If you start to recognize your insecurities, you can begin to process them, and you'll feel more in control once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you connect with your feelings now, you'll know which areas of your life need strengthening or attention.

You may prefer to spend some time alone today, and that's fine too. You'll rejoin your friends and your usual activities when you're ready.

Sometimes people don't need your advice, even if it's solid and knowledgeable. Sometimes, they just want a strong shoulder and a caring ear. You can do this for them now, because your feeling side is stirred up. Sometimes, emotional sensitivity is a good thing!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Perhaps you're dealing with some internal insecurities that are pushing you to rely on tried-and-true customs rather than dramatic, risky acts that may not pan out. Good for you for relying on your inner strength when you need to. That's true courage,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
