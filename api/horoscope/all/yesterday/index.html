That stranger on the street could turn into your friend, for a moment or forever, if the same joke hits you both on the funny bone. Those rumbling dark clouds in your sky will develop giggling silver linings. A good laugh can pull you into your body and into the moment. Try to stay in this place today. Spreading the laughs around could only help. Remember, it's all in the timing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But today you're an activist, putting that strong back of yours into fighting for a cause. Slow down for a second and consider this: how many cans of worms do you want to open? You'll make a much bigger impact if you pick just one thing to concentrate on, instead of trying to tackle the world all at once.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

So here's a little reality check before you go and do it again. Where do you see yourself tomorrow? Next week? Next month? Don't buy a ticket for the wrong direction.

If so, try not to get your feelings hurt, though that's quite a tall order.

Maybe you're just trying to avoid anyone stealing your good ideas. Whatever's going on, if you do decide to talk, go easy on the highbrow references -- it's probably not that kind of crowd.
