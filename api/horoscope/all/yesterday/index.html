        "horoscope": "Wayward wandering will just get you lost. So will charging blindly into the wilderness in anger or on a dare. You probably won't be able to see the forest for the trees today. Did you leave a trail of bread crumbs to mark your return? Maybe this is the time to start. You'll want to have the option of retracing your steps, especially if you still don't have a plan. Whatever you do, don't resign yourself to the fate of being stuck in the middle of nowhere. That's not going to help anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Too much enthusiasm may destabilize your world today. Even if it goes against your philosophy that anything is possible on this wild upward spiral, don't overdo it. And learn to cheerfully take no for an answer instead of grumbling about it. That'll just make you plummet when you really should be leveling out. If you want the good times to keep on rolling, focus on calm appreciation instead of the usual wild celebration. Yes, that means a different kind of fun, but also something more sustainable. You're not getting any younger, you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Show that you're determined to make things right for everyone. So are you a seer and a savior, or a micro-manager and a busybody? Does it matter? As far as you're concerned, it's out with the old and in with the new. Just one day of this mood will turn your world around, or at least rearrange the furniture. Coffee might help you achieve this state, although it's amazing what can happen naturally if you tune in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Your thoughts will be far-reaching today, or maybe even beyond. Why set limits on what you can do? And while you're at it, why not hang with other cerebral types as you peer through this sudden window of opportunity? Trust them to bring all of their brainpower and as little ego as possible. Put your heads together and come up with some truly great ideas. Wait until later to haggle over the intellectual property rights. By the time it gets to that point, there might be enough profit to go around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This goes for strangers and acquaintances, too, even though the outcome of these interactions will be hard to predict. For now, you don't care as much about the end result as you do about the process of connection. If you can, clear your schedule for the day. That way, you'll be ready for any person or encounter that comes knocking on your door.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's easy now to be drawn toward a flashy but risky approach, but you need to maintain your focus. Actually, this is a good test for you. Since you're naturally goal-oriented, it's good for you to experience a bit of greener-grass syndrome from time to time. Whatever it is that suddenly looks so surefire and enticing, resist the urge to chase it. Instead, stay on task for your current project. You can move ahead once you know exactly what you're doing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Use your scientific mind to cook up explanations everyone can understand. Find clever applications for every little idea, and that's your strategy right there. If they perceive you as a creative thinker and fixer-upper, you'll be going somewhere good. And if, along the way, you finally complete your transformation from a noisy protester to a results-oriented prophet, there's an excellent chance that you'll arrive in style.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The more good stuff you have going on, the easier it'll be to ignore the bad stuff that's still following you around. Irritation will dog your steps today, begging for attention. Don't feed it a single scrap. Boredom will circle you like a vulture. Admire the pretty shadows it makes on the ground, but don't look up and don't stop moving. You can't let these things prey on you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

See who else wants to play, unless you're flying solo. It might not be much of a party that way, but if your private life is rich enough, you won't need to socialize right now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

How can you get a handle on something that'll hurt no matter how you grab it? This could be the result of ignoring good advice or common wisdom to follow your own path. Self-made obstacles are likely to hold you back today. OK, so you're beginning to see how it all plays out, and maybe you can stop the downward spiral.

A fairy? The best part of all is that it's somehow real. Maybe you get to define what reality is today. How often does that happen?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Probably more compulsive than anything else. In fact, there's something elegant to your eloquence. And there's no question that you mean well by sharing all this information. But it's a two-way process here, and maybe others have something you need, too. Try listening occasionally today. Don't you want anything in exchange for all that you're giving? You deserve to let them return the favor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
