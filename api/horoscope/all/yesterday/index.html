Respond to offers that praise your ego without insulting your intelligence. Each new challenge makes you feel brave even if it isn't that hard. That's because people believe in you and will bend over backwards for you, assuming you'd do the same for them. If what you have in your heart matches what's in your brain, you'll have a powerful day to grow in this environment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Let this touch of humility turn into another character-building moment. But don't humble yourself too much. The last thing you need now is an inferiority complex. After a certain point, you can't let other people's expectations rule you. Just start living up to your own, and that'll be enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
