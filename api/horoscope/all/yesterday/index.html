It's that everyone is working hard, concentrating on their responsibilities. Why don't you do the same? It's a great day for focusing on your career or getting busy work done at home. The sense of accomplishment you'll feel at the end of the day will be worth the trouble.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That means follow the rules in everything you do. Cutting corners would only mean having to redo something later. But then, taking shortcuts isn't really your style, anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
