Still, a backup plan might not be a bad idea.

Anything could happen with the people surrounding you, and your independent nature is balking at the idea that this might reflect on you. It doesn't have to, but do remember that all things are connected. You reflect on others, too.

But is it possible that you said something tactless or insensitive without realizing it?
