With your natural sense of timing, you're able to turn each moment into the right one -- a real gift. You're building a great reputation -- what will you do with all this positive esteem? Think about your goals, and then ask people for support. You don't always have to be the one pitching in for others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Except stubbornness just isn't your style, and the stress of it can easily lead to physical manifestations like inflexible joints and sore muscles. Why not loosen up, already? You can afford to let this one go. Maybe a more creative approach to problem-solving will make all the difference.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You should be seeking common ground with other people now, not pointing out differences. Try cooperating with other people today.
