Today, however, you must operate with even more shrewdness than usual. Many different opportunities will be coming your way, and it's up to you to zoom in on any and all of them that promise future success. Make sure you're awake, alert and tuned in.

You know they'll just fall out of fashion sooner or later, and probably sooner -- and wouldn't you rather buy security than trouble? Not to mention enjoying the fruits of your hard labors for more than just a few months.

You're lax about the details and fickle about larger commitments. Reassess your priorities today, because someone definitely is watching, and judging too. Get real. Become your inner parent and behave as if everything you do is perfectly transparent. That will sharpen up your work ethic pronto.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
