Today is a great time to spend a bit of your hard-earned cash on something frivolous. Tomorrow will be back to the coal mine!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you have a job interview or any other type of audition lined up, rely on basic lessons of public comportment: Sit up straight, smile, and answer questions directly, with confidence. That should carry you through just fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The thing is, no one is threatening anything of yours that truly matters. Try to recognize that fact, as soon as you can.
