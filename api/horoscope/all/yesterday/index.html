        "horoscope": "A bout of creative thinking makes you seem unconventional in other people's eyes today. Isn't it fun to keep your friends or coworkers on their toes? Just when they think they've got you all figured out, you throw them a curve ball. And there's definitely a method to your madness, as everyone will soon see. For now, don't worry about what others think. Work solo, if you have to. Just keep chasing down these brilliant ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

And where does that leave you? Lonely, maybe. But there's no reason you can't get wrapped up in your own pursuits. Just remember to come up forsometime. With your legendary work ethic, it's easy to focus on a project and end up feeling isolated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
