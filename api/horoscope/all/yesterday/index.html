        "horoscope": "You're highly creative today, and you have the personal presence needed to manifest your ideas in reality. In fact, it might surprise you how easily you can make your visions come true. If only every day were like this! Being emotionally centered certainly helps. So does your heightened sensitivity to beauty. You see something gorgeous in nature, and it looks like art. An act of kindness similarly moves your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Getting work done has a calming effect on you. So does relaxing, whether alone or with friends. You're extra charming now, because you feel so at ease within yourself. Your friends are sure to appreciate you, which makes you feel great!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Repetitive motions or quiet activities are soothing, because they help you focus. So take a long walk or jog, or get some filing, budgeting or cleaning done. These are the kinds of accomplishments that make you feel good at the end of the day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Taste and smell are heightened today, too! So live life as a sensualist. Hug your pets and the people you love. Enjoy your food. Dig your fingers into the dirt in your garden. Take pleasure in the basics.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Especially on days like today, when you're focused and your energy is calm. You can get a lot accomplished in this state of mind, so take advantage of the opportunity. And play as hard as you work. A sincere effort at the office or the gym deserves some solid relaxation at home.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Resolve to be responsible today. This shouldn't be difficult: You're more relaxed than usual, as your usually high energy is reduced a bit and smoothed out, too. And while it's a bit dull to slip into a routine, it certainly feels good to take care of business. That should be your focus now. Cross as many items off your to-do list as possible. Then you can play.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Remember today that you're a calm, gentle leader. Keeping that image in mind will help you avoid various pitfalls that are possible now. For example, if you're tempted to relax and enjoy yourself a little too much, the 'gentle leader' image will remind you to get back to the task at hand. And if a disagreement arises at work or at home, that image will help you tap into your conflict-resolution skills.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's easy to tackle your agenda since your work ethic is too strong to grumble. You know you can get it all done. Just apply yourself to the task at hand. It's also a great day to launch a new personal project, since your planning skills are especially solid.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This is one of those days when, if you follow your instincts, you might end up in a power struggle or otherwise in a tough spot. But if you consciously remind yourself to remain calm and take it easy, you could have a really pleasant day. It's all about enjoying yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That's the very definition of closed-minded. And that just isn't your nature, Sag. You're all about open-mindedness, seeking truth and expanding your vision. Keep those in mind as objectives today.

But being argumentative doesn't solve anything. Instead, try listening calmly to the other side. See if you can relate to their position. It's likely that there's some truth or validity to it. And if not, then you'll know what you're arguing against.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Today you covet something you don't have. This might be an expensive luxury item, or even an attractive person you'd like to get to know better. In some way, jealousy could become an issue. But you don't have to submit to the clutches of the green-eyed monster. Instead, appreciate what you already have. Then treat yourself or a friend to something nice, like flowers or lunch.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
