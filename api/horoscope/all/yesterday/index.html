        "horoscope": "You're in your element today. Your feelings are strong, perhaps even overwhelming. But there's something you actually enjoy about existing in such an emotional head space. Being this closely in touch with your own heart helps you understand others' feelings better. It increases your sense of compassion for the people around you. You can listen carefully and give excellent advice, because you truly relate to others' issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

This helps you connect with other people, too. You understand where they're coming from, and you feel genuine tenderness toward them.
