Now, you're in a loving mood, and you hope for closeness. You're willing to accommodate someone's wishes if it makes the time you spend with them more harmonious. You can also help someone through a difficult emotional time now, because you're even more compassionate than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
