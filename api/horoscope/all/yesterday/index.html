        "horoscope": "You seem airy and wispy to rednecks and bodybuilders. But anyone really watching will see that your inner strength is huge. However, patience is one thing lacking from your unique mix of talents. Also, you could be a little pickier about what you take on. Read between the lines. Catch the right social cues. There's something much better a few blocks down the street. Prove that you can go deeper, grab more and use it better than those fools who think the world revolves around their brute strength.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Do you find yourself craving intense experiences? Maybe that's why you suddenly want it all, or at least as much as you can possibly handle. You feel the need to be radically individual, whether that will mean going against the grain and getting in people's faces or marching off alone to the private soundtrack in your ear buds. Hey, with that attitude, things could get amusing around here today. If you're still having fun with this, maybe you can take it even farther. Just try to stop before you break any laws.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your new ideas are still in committee, after all. This is not the time to implement a plan that's untested or not-yet-approved. Besides, you're too cautious to leap out into thinwith no parachute. So take your time and go through the proper channels to get the backing you need. If you want others' support, keep being nice to them. Otherwise, they could easily find other endeavors that need their assistance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Maybe you're just in a pleasant space right now. But don't go bouncing off the walls just because there's a spring in your step. Whether you're the fearless leader, the resident expert or somehow responsible for setting a good example, others expect you to keep a level head now. Don't go turning an even keel into a slippery slope.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

After all, when everything is brilliant, nothing really stands out. Well, at least you'll have fun as you devise fantastic schemes with that wild imagination of yours. You're more interested in dreaming now than in acting on those dreams, and that's as it should be. Go as far as you want in your mental wanderings, but in reality, stick close to the tried and true.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Because, if you don't already, you certainly should. Attract nothing but good attention, and that will feed directly into how you see yourself. But this isn't about delusion or painting on a happy but false face that you don't actually feel inside. As long as you're being real, reality itself should treat you kindly. And you couldn't ask for better treatment than that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Be happy to carry good news even if it doesn't apply to you. Be bigger than your needs, which should be easy if you don't need much. You can get by on other people's smiles. To ask for more would be to steal a little of their joy, and they need it more than you do. Grow through giving. It's a simple concept that makes a lot of sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You might have to watch for a while anyway before participating. Pay attention when someone proposes a new way out of the mess. Normally you'd close your mind to such ideas. But today you'll find that necessity overrides dogma. And who knows? You might just try something a little different this time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Now you're questioning all those familiar rules and doctrines, or toying with the idea of going over to the rebels. You want to see something happen. You want to take some untried theory, make it real, and show it to the crowd. There may be a price for this, but if so, you'll pay it.

But just because you know what's going on with them, don't interfere. Step aside today. Even if you know what these people are capable of doing, getting involved might just make it worse. Cover your own assets the best you can and leave them to their consequences.

Everyone will break out the banners and confetti to welcome you home. It doesn't matter if you've never been there before and don't know anyone.

Sure, you'll be stirring up a little trouble, but  today it's the really vocal people who will get all the attention. You'd like some of that, too. So how far will you go? Exactly what kind of trouble are you considering here? You're probably looking for applause, not intervention. Stay under the law's umbrella and within the bounds of decency. You've seen little kids act up and teenagers acting out. You know a thing or two about consequences.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
