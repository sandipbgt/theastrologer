        "horoscope": "Once upon a time, someone led the way by breaking with tradition. Maybe you're dreaming about staging your own revolt as soon as conditions are right. Although you may let your friends go first, just to see if it's safe. Nonconformity will probably feel like an empty gesture if you're doing it because everyone else is. These symbolic acts waste time and resources. They also divert people's attention from more important things. Make yourself useful today. Seek fulfillment instead of continuing to live in a vacuum.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Maybe you have issues. Maybe you can't cope. Hey, it's not the end of the world. You still have some creative methods of pushing your way to freedom, whether you're just giving yourself a little breathing space or bailing out and heading for the hills. But slipping away might not solve anything. Flaking out would look really bad on your resume. So why not redirect these skills today? Think less about the flight and more about the fight.

Nobody could blame you for slacking, but don't take it personally if anyone does. They're just not paying attention. Whatever your task is, savor it for a while. Feel the quiet ecstasy of everything finally falling into place. After you celebrate that total connection by cheerfully doing what you're supposed to be doing today, then you can have the party.

Why not perk up and speak up? You don't have to beat around the bush, you know. Sometimes, speaking directly and asking openly for what you need is by far the best way to approach.

But unless you're working a comedy club or hanging with thick-skinned friends, speak kindly whatever your emotions say. Be a good judge of character among strangers, even if they assure you that all is cool. That'll mean being patient with them and not giving them any reason to be annoyed with you. Show up on time, keep a low profile and politely refuse invitations that might stir up trouble. Within just one day you'll start seeing the benefits from all this excellent self-control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

They can be important tools to build a better future for yourself, if you will use them that way. Examine how you have handled relationships or business, and identify the weak spots.

These ideas you're coming up with are too thrilling and tenuous to share just yet. Whether you're wrapped up in a new relationship, a creative project or an idea that could change how people live all over the world, you realize it's still in the conception stages. If people care where you've gone and what you're doing, let them guess.

It would be natural to back away if you're not ready. Just don't tone it down too far, or you'll reduce the song of yourself to a mere whisper. Do try being more grounded, though. That can be healing, plus it might also clear a lot of the static out of your signal.

Let people know who's boss, but do so gently. They won't respond well to aggressive attempts at controlling their behavior or output. However, they'll rebel if they sense even a shred of weakness on your part. Don't let your uncertainty show. Assume a posture of ease, balance and compassion.

Soon, when your ideas have solidified into a real plan of action, you can take control once again.

In fact, this isn't so much a problem as an interesting diversion, one that takes you away to that special place you love so well: that place of solitude and profound thought, of intense pondering and intimate connection with your own soul. You'll rejoin the world tomorrow, when your energy turns outward again. For now, explore your own psyche.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
