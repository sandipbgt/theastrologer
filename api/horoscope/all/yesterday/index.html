        "horoscope": "Today, you're experiencing life from a highly subjective perspective. Of course, you've always been an emotional being. But now your feelings are softer than usual. You might even feel a bit vulnerable, but this is a pleasurable sensation. It makes intimate moments with the people you love even more meaningful. In this state of mind, a beautiful song or a smile from a child has the power to soothe your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your mind may be full of images and impressions, but they're abstract at best. It's hard to make sense of them. Maybe you shouldn't even try. It's okay to have a day or two of fuzzy thinking and general confusion. Your wits will sharpen again soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Leave physically vigorous tasks for another day. You may have trouble concentrating now, too, so hard work at the office may go out the window as well.

Alternatively, a visit to a place filled with meaning -- a church or temple, a mountaintop, a grove of trees in a quiet forest -- may elevate you to a new level of spiritual awareness. Your mind, heart and soul are open and seeking today. Soak up this energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
