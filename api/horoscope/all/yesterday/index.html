This is all about self-protection! Spend time with people who make you feel good about yourself -- who affirm your positive feelings about yourself and your future. Return the favor with your own kindness and affection. This is the best kind of trade.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
