That's the nature of emotions: They aren't rational. They just are. So deal with them on that level. Don't try to intellectualize your own feelings or someone else's. Simply face them and feel them. You'll find that they recede more quickly that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Or perhaps someone with whom you used to be close will resurface, whether in real life or simply in your dreams. These old feelings may be bittersweet, and ultimately, you don't want to get stuck looking backward. Still, there's nothing wrong with taking a day or two to steep yourself in memory.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your feelings and intuitions are the way you find and create meaning in life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's a good time to retreat from the world, if you can. Taking a nap, meditating or writing in your journal are all good ways to manage unruly emotions. Just don't make the mistake of trying to rationalize or ignore them. Bottling them up only makes them grow stronger.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The feelings that arise with these experiences are likely to be powerful. Your instinct may be to push them aside and proceed as if everything is normal. But facing tough feelings is the best way to process them, so they can evaporate.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Spending or eating too much are strong possibilities now, so watch out for them. Pamper yourself, but within reason.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You tend to react first and then consider whether you perceived things correctly. But it would be better to reverse that order!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
