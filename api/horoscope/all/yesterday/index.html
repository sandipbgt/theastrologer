That, in turn, feeds your compassion. After all, we're all human. You understand this basic, fundamental truth better than many. So while plenty of folks are getting all worked up today, you're able to chuckle at the divine comedy of life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You may have a realization that changes everything -- your feelings, your self-perception, even your focus. Or, you may help a friend through a similar transformation. The current energy is the kind that uproots deep feelings and exposes them to light. This process can be painful, but it can also be incredibly freeing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
