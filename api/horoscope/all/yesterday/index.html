        "horoscope": "You're unusually emotional today. You might find yourself lost in a reverie about someone from your past, or someone's sad story might really pull at your heartstrings. This kind of sentimental feeling isn't your usual state, and you might try to ignore it or display bravado you don't actually feel. Why not indulge in a bit of emotional vulnerability? If nothing else, it enables you to make sweet connections with other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Others can benefit from your nurturing energy. So can strangers you smile at as you walk down the street, or someone for whom you hold the door. These little acts of kindness add up to a lot of goodwill, and that's powerful medicine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Taking a soft-edged, rosy view of life isn't silly or weak. It's valiant. Without idealism, no one would be able to envision their heart's desire, or the perfect life for them.

You might realize how thin-skinned you're feeling when someone's comment pushes a button you didn't even realize was a tender spot.

That makes it more important for you to treat them with kindness and compassion. Show yourself this same caring concern, as well.
