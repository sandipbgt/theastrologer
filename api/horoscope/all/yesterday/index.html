When you take care of your body, it's easier for your mind to function at its peak. And you may have a lot on your to-do list, or a complex problem that needs to be reasoned through with care.

Most folks are quietly plugging away at their task lists, staying as focused as possible so they'll reach the finish line faster. Systems come in handy now. Tackling a project without a set strategy is sure to be a study in frustration. Following a set procedure, on the other hand, helps you stay on task.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You've paid careful attention to every detail, and you're certain it's going to pan out when you put it into effect. And you're probably right! Current efforts translate directly to success.

To you, it looks a lot like nitpicking when someone tells you to go back and snip off a loose end you skipped over -- one that didn't really matter in the first place, in your opinion.

This may mean setting your ego or your needs aside in order to place something else first -- doing a good job at work, for example, or doing what's best for your family.

You're more attuned to your health than usual, so eating a more balanced diet is an easier undertaking now. It's mostly a matter of recognizing the consequences of unhealthy eating.

That may mean you'll have to moderate your energy carefully. Fortunately, it's easier than usual to draw on it slowly and steadily. That helps you temper your usual leap-first, look-later approach!

While it's not fair to expect perfection, it's a good idea to do your best. That includes accepting feedback from others who can help you improve your work.

If you interact with someone who's being unreasonable, you can calmly counter their illogical ideas with your own feasible plans. Because of this skill, you make a good manager now. If you're in charge of a group of people, expect to put out some minor fires. And you'll actually enjoy this!
