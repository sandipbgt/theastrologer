But they may be holding back nothing more than an idea or opinion that they're still formulating. Give them the benefit of the doubt. And don't badger them to talk before they're ready! A bit of sensitivity goes a long way today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That's a legitimate worry, but don't let it overwhelm you. Repeat this to yourself: Everything is going to be fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
