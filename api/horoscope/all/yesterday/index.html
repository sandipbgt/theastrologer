Whatever your goals or interests are, you can use the energy and high spirits this brief period brings to take big steps forward. Don't be afraid to knock on many doors, either literally or figuratively. If you feel shy about talking yourself up, just remember: You have skills or information people want.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You'll know instinctively how to present a unified front to your shared enemies. The people you're working with, whether they're friends, coworkers or some other group, will admire your energy and drive. Today could be seriously heroic and productive, if you want it to be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You may think you're experiencing troubles at work or with your sweetie or friends, but really, you're just temporarily stuck in a narrow world view. One way to decrease tensions is by broadening that view. Stop thinking you have all the answers, or that you need them immediately. It's okay to float a bit. Open your eyes and ask questions, even open-ended ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're sweet and sympathetic enough that other people will want to treat you with the same kindness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You don't have to stick to your schedule. Deviating from the plan might actually be very smart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
