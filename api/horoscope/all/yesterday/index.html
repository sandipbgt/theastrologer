Your heart is a little softer than usual, and you can tell when someone near you needs a strong shoulder to lean on. You're even feeling a little sentimental, so it's a great day to pull out the photo album or keepsake box and pore over old memories. Romance provides a great release, too. You can almost feel yourself merging with your sweetheart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Being alone gives you a chance to catch up on your sleep or your reading. Make mental or physical work easy instead of vigorous. It's not that you can't handle it. You're just in the mood for comfort and ease.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That normally keen mind of yours may feel foggy, making it hard to make firm decisions. This could be a good day to take it easy, both mentally and physically. Sleep late, take a midday nap or get to bed early tonight. Lose yourself in a great book or movie.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

People can sense your warmth from a mile away, so don't be surprised if acquaintances and even strangers come to you for advice or support. You can afford to give out extra now, but you'll reserve your best for your loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're dramatic by nature, and it's even easier than usual to sway people with your charisma. But you're also a true romantic, so someone's sweet gestures could sweep you off your feet. Make sure every gesture or offer you make is genuine and heartfelt. And take a wait-and-see attitude with anyone who's trying to win your affection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Maybe your head is just in the clouds, or maybe life is genuinely a little foggier right now. Either way, be careful to look where you're going, both literally and figuratively, to avoid missteps and mistakes. If concentration just won't come, don't push it. Give yourself the day off.

Service to a person, pet or cause feels wonderful. Just be sure to choose your cause carefully. Trying to help those who refuse to help themselves won't ultimately be very productive.

You can also tell when someone is feeling sad, hurt or sensitive, and you genuinely want to help them. The level of understanding you're able to offer now could really make someone's day, especially if you tap into your inner counselor. You give great advice, because you really understand what makes people tick.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But today, you might have a hard time distinguishing pie-in-the-sky ideals from cold, hard reality. And the truth is, you'd rather not face reality if it's cold and hard! Your own dreams and fantasies are so much more appealing. Just don't deceive yourself.

But today, it's all about making emotional connections. You're feeling soft and open, so time spent with loved ones is very special now. Alone time is good, too, especially if you pamper yourself in some way. Watch a movie or take a nap. Just for today, don't push yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's a great day for restful, low-key activities like napping, yoga, reading or writing. But if you're feeling more energetic than that, just listen to your body. You're good at tuning in to other people's feelings and needs. Today, tune in to your own, and honor them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
