Don't be afraid to spend a little cash on this venture, if you need to. Don't go overboard with your spending, of course, but if an expense is warranted, go ahead and cover it. Soon, whatever you covet will be yours, fair and.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But that's just a universal truth: Things are bound to get mixed up, no matter what. It's perfectly within your power, however, to make this a peaceful blending instead of a violent crashing of opposing elements.

You know in your heart that it's time to stop bellyaching and dragging yourself around, and get out there and accomplish something. All you have to do is motivate yourself, and a fresh start could really take you far today.

When new  concepts come up, instead of trying to cram in as much information as you can in as little time as possible, take your time in exploring it all.

Just kidding -- but remember that though you might pretend to be calm and simple today, everyone can see right through you. Which means your strong personality shines through even the dullest of days, which is a good thing. So why not keep the illusion going for a while? Be helpful and cooperative.

But examine what's going on under the surface of your life. Are you afraid of losing something or someone? If so, try not to be. Anything that changes now was meant to develop or, perhaps, end.

If you've had your eye on someone special, let them know how you feel. If you're in a romantic relationship, open up to your partner and make yourself vulnerable.

Well, maybe you can't. This may come down to a conscious choice between the two. If so, here's a helpful hint: Choose the path that helps the most people, and hurts the fewest.
