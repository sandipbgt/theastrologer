Whatever's going on, this is a good time to clean house, whether literally or figuratively. Your life will surely benefit from a purge of some kind, and you'll feel a lot better once you've gotten rid of some dead weight. And your focus should be on keeping your own life as simple and healthy as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Maybe focusing on a solo project will help you calm your worries and start feeling centered once again.

That's certainly worth putting in the effort, so stay alert and energetic today.
