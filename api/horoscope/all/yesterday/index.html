But you can see through this to what lies beneath: a deep and genuine urge for affection. If you recognize this kind of behavior in yourself, view it with compassion. If you see it in someone else, reach out to them. Your warmth could make them feel much more secure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
