They might even cut you a little more slack than usual in exchange for one of your trademark charming apologies. It's good that you have these skills and know how to use them, but it would be a mistake to base your plans on the kindness of strangers.

It's not like you really have a choice about these things, either. This is you in your element, and all is very cool -- even that warm, sunny feeling.
