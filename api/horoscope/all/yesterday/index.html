        "horoscope": "Attention to detail is one of your many strengths, so it's no wonder you're so exacting about your own system of getting things done. But today, you're being a little thoughtless about other people's systems. They have agendas too, you know, ones that are every bit as valid as yours, much as you hate to admit it. Open the floor to discussion. This should be a democracy, not a dictatorship. Listen to your friends', loved ones' or coworkers' ideas, and incorporate them into your own. There really is room here for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Your eyes are lighting up with understanding. And listen to yourself speak! Today you're fluent in the languages of both heart and mind. Explore with youthful optimism and that feeling of all-the-time-in-the-world. Compete with all the rules and tricks you know. Challenges stir your blood with demands to prove or defend something. If it's a reasonable challenge, respond ASAP. If it seems unreasonable, think about why you should get involved. Because, in spite of that surging feeling, you really don't have all the time in the world. Be smart about using what you do have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Watch how your enthusiasm makes ripples in the world. And while you're watching, notice how certain people will catch your eye today. They'll arouse your passions or give you reason to be suspicious. Be up front about what's in the back of your mind. In fact, show courage whatever you do. Thanks to good instincts, your emotions will be on your side. Thanks to your overall fitness or lucky moments of coordination, your body will do what you tell it. Trust yourself and have fun no matter what else happens to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Yes, you're obviously the sum of your experiences. Nobody's arguing about that. But while the past matters, don't get too attached to it. Avoiding confrontation with the present might seem like a safe strategy, but that could start a chain of events you may not want triggered. Want to take control of your life? Then take a day to see where you're going. It's the only way to become the master of your own destiny. If your promising future starts to resemble your glory days, let it take shape organically instead of forcing yourself back into a mold that no longer fits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's anyone's guess as to who will come out ahead. At this point, the grind isn't quite so thrilling for you anymore. In fact, it feels like a lot of hard work. Won't it feel good to stop? Remember that you'll be able to relax soon. Today, keep up your energy and focus on reaching the finish line.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Throw yourself into the middle of their troubles and watch their enemies run off with their tails between their legs. Help your new best friends heat things up, put out fires, or whatever they need from you. Even if nothing dramatic is going on, give them high quality focus today. Your nobility will be rewarded, just in case you wanted a reward.

You're far more vocal than usual about how you see the world. But though it may feel good to shout out your truth for once, there's really no need to be so aggressive about it. You're completely authentic today, which means you can afford to be gentle with other people. Your best course of action now is to act quietly and decisively. That way, you'll draw allies instead ofto your side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

After all, you're used to pursuing your desires and ambitions with single-minded intensity. The problem is, at the moment, your center is off. A good strategy for this period is to lower your aim. That way, you won't be disappointed byto your ideas or obstacles cropping up at every turn. Also, forgive others freely for standing in your way. Then they'll forgive you.

You might lash out to attack and suddenly find yourself in retreat when your target strikes back even harder. You have a lot of nerve, but don't be insulted by that. Risk-takers actually have a good thing going if they'd only use that nerve the right way. Dare to think positively. Meet the challenge of making yourself comfortable in this world. You do have to live here, you know. Find a way to live here peacefully yet on your terms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That would be denying how you got here, and your history is a critical piece of who you are. Live vigorously for the future, because that's about who you're still becoming. And strange as this may seem, today you can be in a few places at once. That means it's too soon to shut off any channels radiating from you.

You can share and test out your hypotheses together. Soon, when it's time to tackle life head-on once again, you'll have all the best ideas and tools for reaching a satisfactory conclusion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And thanks to that light, you're seeing farther than usual, discovering things you never knew existed, and getting intense around new ideas. Good on you for reaching this illuminated state. And if those ideas are really good, they can wait another day. Stay focused on the now. You have business here, remember? Don't ditch the people who will suffer if you leave in the middle of things. And don't try to run with loose ends whipping madly around your ankles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
