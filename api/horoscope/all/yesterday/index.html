Maybe you'll host an impromptu party and supply all the beverages and snacks. Or maybe you'll take your sweetheart and a few friends on a trip, and offer to foot the bill. Just make sure you can afford it before going too far. Magnanimous gestures are wonderful, but not if they put you in the red.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Either way, stop and honestly consider whether you're amassing wealth or just money-grubbing. Cast a stern eye on your own enterprises, and fix anything that looks bad as soon as you can.
