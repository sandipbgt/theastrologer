You know the clues: the body language, the rolling eyes, the gazes across the room. Everyone has an agenda, and they aren't that hard to figure out. Whether or not those agendas actually affect you, it's possible to understand them without actually agreeing. Master the phrase 'I'll get back to you later on that' and use it today,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
