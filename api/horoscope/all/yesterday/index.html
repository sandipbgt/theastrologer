Even if you're the boss, it's important to give people autonomy and treat them with respect. The current emphasis is on compromise. Working together is much more effective than going solo, or worse, dictating orders and expecting others to comply. Instead, seek input from everyone. Let them know their ideas matter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
