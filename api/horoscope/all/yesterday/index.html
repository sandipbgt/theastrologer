It also helps that your energy is so deep and grounded. Your emotional fortitude and your good, strong back make it possible for you to accomplish just about anything. You can also serve as a pillar of courage for your loved ones, who may not feel as centered as you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Left to their own devices, people might simply access their anger. But under your influence, and with your encouragement, they can start talking about the hurt feelings that lie behind the anger. That's exactly how healing and understanding begin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Now you can delve into a subject and really explore it from the inside out. This is all about shining a light into the darkness, to call out what has previously been hidden.

This is so unlike you! But don't worry -- it will pass soon. You'll be able to laugh at how worked up you got over next to nothing. But for now, whatever you're feeling seems enormous and real, so feel it.

But if any difficult feelings begin to develop, such as self-doubt, embarrassment or fear of rejection, a sweet situation could get sticky fast. Watch out for the tendency toward possessive or obsessive behavior.

Somehow, things keep getting steered toward deeper subjects, such as fear and anxiety, love and desire, and so on. You may wonder whether this is strictly appropriate.

Otherwise, you'll fall for every highly charged story you hear! Remember, your perceptions don't necessarily reflect the truth. Check into the facts before you act or react today.
