        "horoscope": "You're faced with something surprising today -- a truly unexpected idea, maybe, or behavior that you think is rebellious simply for rebellion's sake. But maybe there's more to it than that. Sometimes it's important to challenge the status quo, and this may be one of those days. Before you condemn someone for thinking or acting in offbeat ways, find out if there's actually a method to their madness. You may be surprised,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But you have the power to really inspire people, so let that shine through. Convince them that you have their interests in mind, and they'll be far more willing to work with you. A self-serving agenda, on the other hand, is likely to push them away.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
