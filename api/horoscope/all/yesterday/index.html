Get into the lighthearted, optimistic energy of the moment. Be tolerant of your loved ones, even if they're being impossibly silly -- or just impossible. It's up to you to create this positive vibe,. You can do it if you put your mind to it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Get out of the house and visit all your friends and family members, or volunteer a few hours of your time at a church or a shelter for animals or the homeless. Interacting with other people makes you feel good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Don't make set plans, and try not to develop any firm expectations of the way your day should unfold. Instead, follow your instincts from one experience to another. If life turns out to be a little out of the ordinary, so much the better! You'll have interesting memories to look back on later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
