Your words will be liquid today, and your actions will be fluid. Your position will be bendable, too. Either you do a lot of yoga, or you've got relaxation down to a science. Some people may call you spineless for all this, but that's only because they're so rigid. All you're doing is changing with the changes, and that's OK for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

As much as you might prefer life to be neat, clean and efficient at all times, you have to accept the fact that you occasionally need other people. Whatever's going on, consider this a warm welcome back into human society. This is what being alive is all about, so enjoy it. Be glad there's affection in your life.

Let real friends offer real help. They actually like you even if you're all living with one foot in the land of illusion.

If you're working on a group project, your coworkers want to know you're all on the same page. Similarly, your friends want to know you're still the same person they know and love.

People have good and bad sides, and right now being decisive, loyal and, yes, polite will resolve a lot more problems than those behaviors create.
