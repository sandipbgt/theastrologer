        "horoscope": "Other people are on the cool side today. Even your closest friends or relatives may seem aloof. Of course, you're such a warmhearted, sensitive person that it's easy for you to pick up on subtle fluctuations in your relationships. If this happens now, don't place too much importance on it. Many people are preoccupied with exciting projects or intellectual theories. They're stuck in their own heads, but they'll return soon!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Your theme for today should be 'outside the box.' Take an innovative approach to a task at work. And if you normally sit in a cubicle, by all means, get out of that little box! You can even apply this to mundane activities like running errands or folding laundry. Challenge yourself to do things a bit differently from the way you normally do them. Find a new system that works better than the old one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

At a business meeting or at home with your family, you might look around at these people you thought you knew so well, and wonder what's gotten into them.
