But do watch your tendency to overeat. You're self-indulgent by nature, and today's vibe increases your urge to nurture yourself and others with comfort food. Holding hands serves the same purpose as a third helping of cake, you know -- and it won't leave you feeling stuffed and bloated!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
