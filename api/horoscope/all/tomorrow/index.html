Don't be surprised if there's a lump in your throat and tears in your eyes as you think about someone you love. Trust that they love you, too, just as fiercely. Even your connection with people long gone, either because they've moved away or passed on, is strong. Revel in these spirit bonds.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
