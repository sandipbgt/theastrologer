And isn't telling the straight truth just so much more interesting? You could light aunder someone without even trying! Which is always good for a few laughs. Don't do anything just for laughs now, though -- try to have a point, too. That's part of what being practical is all about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Some project or problem will be resolved soon, but not just yet. Ask questions with caution, and don't expect to make any major strides toward a newer, better situation. Instead, try to be patient -- which, granted, isn't your strong suit. But that's what's required at the moment, and you can do it if you put your mind to it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

They might laugh at first, but they'll change their tune once they hear all the cool stuff coming from your house. Today you'll work for harmony because you love the sound of it. But remember, you can't maintain this purity forever. You can let a little friendly noise creep back in once you're clear that everyone is getting along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You've been here before, and by now you should be comfortable in your creative role as a new cycle begins. So kick-start the engine to power up your latest and greatest. See if you can get it online today. If the whole thing isn't ready to go, find the part you can live with and put that out for all the world to see.

If you have to push against the crowd, make it feel like a massage or some other kind of pleasant physical encounter. They'll tolerate you if you tolerate them. Keep it real as you manifest gently today. By not pretending, you'll stir up a lot of healthy curiosity in this calm but irresistible force you're putting out. You'll grow a stronger team in the process, too, because once you have them hooked, they'll follow you anywhere.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

In a room where everyone's shouting and no one's listening, how much really gets done?, instead of working at cross purposes, listen to the ideas of others and try to find common ground. That way, you won't strain your voice, your health, or your bank account, and you can actually accomplish something.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It'd be bad to get lazy now, and your discriminating tastes might end up closing too many doors. Balance is critical now, so open up your mind and work with other people instead of shutting them out or just ignoring them. You'll find that they add a lot to your day, if you let them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Things may be changing, and adapting to a new system won't be easy if you have to start from the bottom. Chilly silence at inappropriate jokes might be the first indication that you crossed the line. Stop fighting for what doesn't matter anymore. Make your peace now before the battle even begins. So what if someone laughs at you for surrendering? Don't let them drag you into their downward spiral. Rise up instead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Set an upstanding example for the world, if only to prove that you can still shine on command. Then, after you're all caught up on those karmic honey-do chores, you'll have a chance to kick off your goody two-shoes and get down and dirty -- if that kind of thing still appeals to you.

If not, be more approachable today. Make sure you're not working at cross-purposes with somebody who wants what's best for you. Even when your intentions are golden, one little slip could look really bad. Do your best, and if you screw up, at least you can say you tried. You'll have other chances to be perfect, especially if you find someone more sympathetic to your flaws.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Don't say anything that's not absolutely necessary, which includes most of your current opinions -- your view of the world is a little screwy at the moment. Your energy is off, and it's better for everyone if you just sit back and take it easy. Of course, withdrawing completely won't do, either. Find a happy medium between 'lone wolf' and 'in your face aggression.' Spend time with people you love and trust.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Any chaos that surrounds you at work or at home today will only serve to focus your own attention on the bottom line: What needs to be done, and what's the best way to make it happen? Your perspective is clear and you're able to be diplomatic with just about anyone. You're actually quite charming now, which will certainly help bring allies to your side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
