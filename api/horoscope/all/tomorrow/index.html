Strike a compromise: Set a timer for one hour, and work as hard as you can for that full period. Then take a five-minute break. Stroll around the office and chat up your coworker. Then it's time to get back to your desk and reset the timer.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
