And yet, can't you relate, at least a little bit? You've got your own streak of individuality, and the current energy tickles that part of you -- the part that wants to be your own person, no matter what. Instead of judging others, why not loosen up yourself?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
