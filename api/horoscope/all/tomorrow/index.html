        "horoscope": "You're in the mood to spend time with your best friend, sweetheart or family today. But if they don't seem quite as keen on closeness, maybe you're being a little demanding of their time. Possessive feelings are common today, and no one likes feeling smothered. It may be a good idea to keep the old saying in mind -- 'If you love someone, set them free.' People adore you,. They'll be back in no time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But it's likely that you won't have to put out any fires at all, because the whole world seems easygoing now. It's a great day for spending time at home or with people you love and trust. It's also a great day for getting a lot accomplished, because your energy is strong and steady.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If you're taking this stance on an issue that's critically important to you, that's one thing. But if you're simply putting your foot down because you just don't want to budge -- well, that's not exactly fair, is it? Surely everyone involved can have their wishes respected. You want what's best for everyone,. Start from there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
