        "horoscope": "Life could get a little emotional today. Don't be surprised if your interactions with other people lead to feelings or situations that can't be explained away with logic. That's the nature of emotions: They aren't rational. They just are. So deal with them on that level. Don't try to intellectualize your own feelings or someone else's. Simply face them and feel them. You'll find that they recede more quickly that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your feelings and intuitions are the way you find and create meaning in life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You might find yourself gravitating toward comfort foods or retail therapy. Hey, if it helps you feel more balanced, it's worth it, as long as you don't go overboard. Spending or eating too much are strong possibilities now, so watch out for them. Pamper yourself, but within reason.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
