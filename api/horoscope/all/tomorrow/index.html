Heading out for dinner or happy-hour appetizers is not the only way to have fun. Invite your friends to come to you, if you like, and have an impromptu potluck party. Or just spend a little quality time with your family, or with yourself. Sometimes, solo time is when the best, most creative moments happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Today is all about using that keen eye of yours to update the way you do things at home or with loved ones.
