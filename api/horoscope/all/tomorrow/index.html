If you're gallant about how you take the initiative, no one will say you're taking advantage. It just wouldn't be polite. But if you're going to make any promises, you'd better follow through on them. Keeping your word is the only way to keep your credibility. And best of all, it's not even a stretch for you. Living a responsible life might actually agree with you. Who knew?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You've pounded the pavement to get support, approaching all the right people, and some of the wrong ones. Today, though, you should find that your efforts start to pay off. Your warm heart can't help but enhance your increasing opportunities. People respond to your positive energy and optimism. Your dreams could come true now. In fact it's bound to happen, since you've already sent out the invitations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's probably not as much of a freak accident as you think, but don't worry about that. Just enjoy being carefree and helpful around others,now that you have a sure thing in your own life. Accept this truth without bragging. Instead, start giving back to the world just because it feels like the right thing to do. Let today be your statement of how sincere and committed you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Today's energy is much better suited to getting some work done at the office.  Better yet, spend some time with your sweetheart. It's okay that the playhouse will be empty. That just gives you a chance to rehearse your lines diligently for your future audience. You can perfect your approach. Soon, you can really impress them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Use your imagination to arrive at new discoveries about your life. Above all, today should be about staying comfortable. For now, nothing can hurt you.

And when pure luck falters, your confidence and sense of conviction will do the rest. With such a solid sense of self, you can relish your power without abusing it. Other people will respect you, and they're more likely to go along with your brave ideas.

You'd be more effective if you were more focused. Once you come to grips with your own frustration, it'll be easier to understand others and their behavior. But can you change them if they don't want to change? Bossy people might actually just spin their wheels as they try to make something happen. Widen your horizon today.

Yet your instincts are telling you to complain and boss other people around. If you're going to be a loudmouth, at least be motivated enough to take care of things instead of pawning it off on someone else. Match your words with actions, and be ready to trade your comfort for results. Don't worry. This won't last forever.

It's more than just a sunny disposition, too, although there won't be any dark clouds on the horizon for quite a while. This kind of beauty is more than skin deep. It warms to the core. Let your happy intelligence shine out today. Make them all see the light. Because when you put it that way, they'll believe anything you tell them.

Your normal stride turns into a defensive swagger as you try to pretend you're strong, secure and admirable. But no one's taken in by arrogance, and prickly behavior won't make you any allies. There's got to be a better way to show your strength,, because you are strong. You're powerful and smart and capable, just like you want people to believe. Maybe you should start believing in yourself, again. Then what others think won't even matter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You've been there and done that, and tried to put it behind you. Expect it to get a lot more personal today as your heart warms up and your intimate relationships are highlighted. You know the saying 'If you love someone, set them free.' It should be easy enough to do that today and you'll be glad you did, once your loved one returns to you, proving their devotion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Clearly you're one of the boys or girls, depending on your gender affinity, but you could be a lot more dignified, too. Appeal to refined tastes instead of tickling base urges today. Enlighten instead of flashing. Amuse without abusing. No matter what the marketing people and the pollsters say, being subtle is the way to go. Your audience will like you even more when you don't insult their intelligence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
