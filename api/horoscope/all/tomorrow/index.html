It's so much easier than negotiating everything with someone else! And yet, some of the most important work can only be done within a partnership. Just think of your closest relationships, both personal and professional ones. Haven't you grown through them? Keep that in mind today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You may not be the leader of the pack, but you're perfectly willing to brainstorm ideas and carry them out in a cooperative way. In fact, you can be instrumental in keeping the team together if someone else isn't feeling so adaptable.
