In settings like this, you can relax and be yourself, which enables you to tend to others' needs more freely. But if you're in a new place or in the company of acquaintances or strangers, you may feel the urge to withdraw, whether literally or emotionally.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You might simply want to stare out the window and let your mind wander. Your thoughts tend to go backward now, into the realm of memory. There's something restorative about sifting through old feelings and recollections, even if they're bittersweet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your leadership skills are currently highlighted, but it's especially important now to treat other people with compassion. Most people are in sensitive moods, and many have low energy.

This enables you to treat them with great empathy. Don't be surprised if you give out lots of hugs or caring advice under the current influence.

        "horoscope": "Some people are highly emotional, but you've always been more an intellectual type. You tend to filter your feelings through your thoughts and perceptions, and you prefer not to wallow in emotion. Today, though, life enters a decidedly subjective realm, and it's smart to accept that instead of working against it. For starters, be compassionate when someone speaks of emotional issues. Instead of offering advice or tough love, try offering simple, kind support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You might push their buttons without realizing what you're doing. If you learn that you've hurt someone's feelings, be kind. Offer an apology, even if you think they've overreacted! Blowing off their concerns will only make them feel worse. But validating their feelings will make them feel heard and cared for.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

When you feel insecure, you might respond by strengthening the external structures of your life -- your financial profile, for example, or your career or home-buying plan. But while those are all good ways to create long-term security, they probably don't address the heart of the issue, which is emotional in nature.
