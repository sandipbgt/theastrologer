This cycle will keep repeating unless you do something to interrupt it. Some rigorous exercise would help. So would spending some time alone, or practicing a little deep-breathing or yoga. If you don't use any of these techniques, at least you can try not to prolong the tension unnecessarily.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
