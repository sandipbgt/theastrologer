You never set out to lead anybody on. You just happen to like people, and it was a charming moment. Good friends will understand your mood. People on your team will back off and wait for you to come up with some results. Soon this whole prickly incident will be over and you'll go back to making appearances and signing autographs.

Maybe you won't get a hit on what's going on with the object of your needs and desires. Just be yourself, OK? Either it'll happen or it won't.

Find better uses for your energy today. Choose a more constructive path toward a more worthwhile goal.

Things are out of your hands for the moment, so what else can you really do but go with the flow?
