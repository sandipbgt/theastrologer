Many people are in the mood to work together toward a common goal, especially one aimed at helping someone or something -- the environment, for example, or disadvantaged people who could use some assistance. If you're a part of a group like this, your natural skill set is a real asset. You'll keep everyone grounded in reality and practicality, when they might otherwise base too much on idealistic notions.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your thoughts are zinging around like lightning bolts, and you're making connections that wouldn't have occurred to you just a day or two ago. But don't be haphazard in your thinking. A systematic approach to testing out new theories works best.

You're creative by nature, and the current influence heightens your ability to look at life from an utterly new and inspired perspective.

After all, being the same as everyone else would be so boring! Nurture your uniqueness by pursuing a subject you find deeply, personally interesting today. Let your mind roam where it will.

You just aren't much for change; you never have been. You prefer to know what's coming, and the idea of life being up in themakes you uncomfortable.

The same goes for old ideas, too. You're questioning everything! And that's the way it should be.
