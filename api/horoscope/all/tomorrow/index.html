        "horoscope": "Security is one of your chief concerns,, so the anxious feeling permeating this day is troublesome. It's hard to trust others at the moment. You might slip into an isolated mode, believing that if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. If you have family or employees depending on you, watch that you don't start issuing orders like a tyrant. That kind of behavior is just unnecessary. This is simply an uneasy mood you're in, and it will pass within a day. Stay calm. Try to have some fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Today's warm, loving energy puts you in touch with your sincere side. You really want to do some good for someone, and you're willing to put in honest effort toward that end. Of course, you've always been a humanitarian, so this isn't a huge stretch for you. But maybe you've been a little complacent lately, thinking you're doing enough and there's no room for improvement. Which, of course, there always is! Best of all, making someone else feel like a million bucks, or even just making them smile, feels equally good to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Show your eagerness to help. Maybe you think you know what they want, but do them the courtesy of asking anyway. Obviously this Good Samaritan business has a social networking angle, too. You probably wouldn't mind hooking up with some of these people to whom you're reaching out.

They want a bit of the elixir you're sipping -- except your nectar of the moment is simply life itself. The universe seems full of possibilities, and you're tuned in to each and every one of them.

You know you won't stray from the path you know is right. You're too dedicated for that. Treat people with care. Tend to your work. Above all, pay attention to details.

But this time you're quick to smile, because it's also a beautiful place and, like you, many of these awesome people totally get it. Let your generous side triumph today as you share that joke and spread the good word. Invite this mood to stay longer. By now you probably understand that this feeling comes from the inside.

What you need is an ally. Someone who can help you focus on the real issue, whatever that might be, and brainstorm some ways to improve things. But the way you're coming across might make that difficult, if not impossible. Try not to call too much attention to your unfinished project.

Yes, it's important to get your feelings out there, but this isn't your moment to strut in the spotlight across the stage of public opinion. There are strings attached here, and they'll get tangled if you keep making the wrong moves. Don't needlessly complicate your situation. And if you and the other party still aren't seeing eye to eye, a day apart might help things. Sometimes you can put a problem on the back burner and let it slow-cook its own solution.

You'd like more time to do things the old-fashioned way. You're more connected to your traditional values than usual. So live by them. Forget about efficiency, no matter what your employer or colleagues might tell you. It's not about maximum output; it's about doing things carefully and right.

Instead of trying to make them see the light, keep your distance. And if they're your friends, maybe you should rethink your standards for friendship.

This is the perfect time to go out on a limb and test your new wings, but do try to use your better judgment. Pushing yourself in your workout is fine; trying a bold approach at the office is great.
