        "horoscope": "Do you have a bee under your bonnet? You're certainly acting twitchy today. And you can be fairly certain that sarcasm and irritability won't get you what you want. But ignoring your exasperation and staying soft and kind feels impossible. A hard workout at the gym might really help. If you don't have time for that, take a few moments to close your eyes and breathe deeply. Find some way to curb this intense energy that's boiling inside you, so you can get something constructive accomplished.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Of course, if you're supposed to be following someone else's lead, you're probably feeling rebellious, to say the least. Can't you just try to get along? There's no need for all this pushing and pulling. This is one of those days when trying to take control of a project or a group won't work out for you or anyone else involved. You're better off being cooperative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
