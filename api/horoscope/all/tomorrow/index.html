Normally you'd rather keep the peace than assert yourself in group situations, but you do have a competitive streak, and it may emerge if, for example, someone steps on your toes at work. This could be a difficult situation for you, since you really dislike conflict. Just remember that it's your right and responsibility to stand up for yourself when necessary.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
