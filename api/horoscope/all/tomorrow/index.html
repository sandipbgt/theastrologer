The world needs a little tension to hold it together, because otherwise everything will droop and melt into a puddle of syrup. Speak from the id for today. Greed, lust, scorn and pity are all OK in moderation. It's all part of being alive, and last time you checked your pulse and breathed on a mirror, you were definitely alive.

So, to what does everyone owe this honor? They asked for a little input and suddenly you hit the ground running. You're quick enough to oblige when you have something to gain from giving. A concealed motive might be OK today. After that, though, you'll need to speak up.

It could be that you're a romantic with enough self-awareness to sense a pack of wolves just around a corner that you're not going to turn. You're feeling susceptible to harmful influences.

If there are any surprises today, you want to be the one to spring them. Just don't be surprised if others don't agree. You're not the one who makes the rules, you know.
