        "horoscope": "You love to relax and enjoy yourself, but you're practical enough to realize that relaxation is so much easier once you've completed your work. Today, concentrate on moving through your responsibilities. Keep your favorite form of relaxation -- a bath, a nap, curling up with a good book -- in mind as a goal. That way, once you cross everything off your task list, you can reward yourself with an activity you really enjoy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Be thorough and methodical, and cover all your bases. That way, you won't have to redo anything later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
