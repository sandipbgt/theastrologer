Whatever's changed inside you, you're having one insight after another, and they're spot-on. Now is not the time to keep your newfound wisdom to yourself, either. Share it with the people around you. They could really use the help. And in return, you'll enjoy making a difference in their lives. Rest assured, the favor will be repaid somewhere down the line, when you need it most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Reach out to people you think you can trust. Conspire and cooperate. Initiate newcomers into your secret order, whether you're bringing them on board for something silly or serious. Of course this will look selfish to outsiders, but true insiders should be delighted to share. You'll do your part, anyway. For today, new blood will be the wonderful, critical, mysterious element that could turn this little costume drama into an act of importance. And you'll be coordinating the whole thing like some imperial puppet master. How cool is that?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

So today, you'll devote yourself to taking time out on a project to regroup and troubleshoot, or simply continuing to put forth your usual effort. If this doesn't sound terribly action-packed, that's because it's not. Right now is all about maintenance, not wild growth or creativity.

Maybe you'll mess with people's minds, and bend their thoughts into shapes that will help them. Maybe you'll tickle loved ones until they finally relax and laugh along with you.

Are you just playing devil's advocate for the fun of it? At the same time, don't go around suppressing those who disagree with you. Don't pout when someone else dares to step onstage. So you want to look great? Well, the real challenge here is being fair to everyone. Even if you don't trust them yet, you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Soon, the time will come to push your own agenda more forcefully.

Mistakes are growth opportunities, and sometimes honesty really is the best policy, even if it causes an argument., if you get into it with someone today, focus on what you have in common instead of your differences.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Maybe you can use this turned-on, tuned-in energy to bring people into your corner on some important project. Or, just use it for some fun and good times.

Fly your true colors and see how many people stop to watch them snapping in the sunshine and wind.

You'll probably get plenty of all three, but that's OK. That's how it is near the top of the food chain. This burst of result-driven energy may render you tightfisted with your budget.

You'll just have to rely on your crafty charm to get them in your corner! Good thing you're even more charming than usual.

Other people might think you're vulgar if you're too focused on your own pleasures. Don't even try to convince yourself that their judgments don't matter -- they do, more than you may realize. A better way to handle this mood is to eat right, get plenty of sleep, and exercise. Maintaining your health is a form of self-indulgence, after all, but one no one could argue with.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
