        "horoscope": "Creativity provides you with a wonderful escape today. Your imagination is very active -- in fact, it might be overactive. This is one of those days when vague emotions could make you uncomfortable. But you can turn this into a positive by using your feelings and impressions in a creative way. For example, you might paint images from a dream, or use it as the basis for a song or a short story.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Understanding human psychology is one of your greatest strengths and your best characteristics. And today, it's at the forefront of your experience. You want to hear people's stories of hardship, and not just because you find human nature interesting. You genuinely empathize with their difficult feelings and tough times. You may get a chance to offer someone good advice today. At the very least, you can offer them an attentive ear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're just in a slightly raw emotional space. But your creativity is also highly charged today. It's a great day to escape into your own imagination. Reading, listening to music and daydreaming can all bring up wondrous images and ideas. Tune in to them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're in such a sentimental mood, a sad story can pierce your heart. A gorgeous song might prompt memories that bring tears to your eyes.

This is a highly subjective state of mind that you're in, and a creative one. You could have ideas today that spur important projects, if you let images and impressions come as they will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But what happens when it turns out that your pretty dreams and visions aren't quite as lovely or as plausible as you imagined? That's the kind of realization you could have today.

Write them down when you wake up! Daydreaming is extra enjoyable now, too. Your mind wanders like a leaf on the breeze, touching on different subjects. You might think mostly in abstract images today. Your thoughts don't need to make logical sense.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If you don't want to be alone right now, find a friend to spend the day with you, or give someone a call. But being on your own isn't so bad.

Many people are dealing with unsettled feelings now, and you could be among them. Perhaps it's just a result of having your sensitivities stirred up. Whatever it is, try not to attach too much importance to it if you're a bit blue. Melancholy feelings will be fleeting.
