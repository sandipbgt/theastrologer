You're drawn to people who have unusual ideas, because there's nothing you'd rather explore than fresh, strange intellectual terrain.

But don't be surprised if you encounter some fact or theory that doesn't mesh with what you already think to be true. Instead of rejecting this out of hand, give it some consideration. You may end up revising your own views, in the end.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
