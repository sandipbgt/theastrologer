You might think you're just having a laugh, but someone else could find you unpleasant. Take a step back and look at yourself today. You're likely to find that you've said or done some things you might wish you hadn't. An apology would help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Beyond that, your aspirations are relatively modest. You've no need at the moment to rush out into the world and try to achieve some big, noisy success.
