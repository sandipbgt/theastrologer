        "horoscope": "Today is all about communication. Reach out to people. Let them know what you've been thinking about, and listen to their thoughts as well. This simple act of exchanging information can help you become clearer in your own mind. And that's a real gift, especially today, when you can see all sides of an issue. Talking things over with other people helps you balance out your knowledge and choose a stance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Communication takes center stage today. Do your best to keep it light, even when you're discussing heavy or important subjects. And don't just talk -- listen, too! If other people feel like you're just issuing orders, they're less likely to do your bidding. But if you keep your tone light and humorous, and listen to others' input and concerns, everything you do now will be a success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Today, a lighthearted, playful mood sets in. Staying home, especially alone, just doesn't appeal. You want to get out and greet the world. You'll probably find yourself chatting with strangers as you run errands, even if you're normally a shy type. And at work, you'll talk and laugh with your coworkers, which could easily get in the way of doing actual work! That's okay, though. Building interpersonal connections is important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But now, you're energetic and easily distracted. At the end of the day, you might find that you've started ten different projects -- and completed not one of them! That's okay, though. Soon, your many different thoughts will unite into one, focused purpose.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That could define your day. If so, just stay as focused as possible on your goal. And cut out any distractions that you can control. Ignore emails and the ringing phone for a while, so you can get something done!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You might want to work with your usual efficiency, but ringing phones or frequent visits from friends or coworkers makes it impossible to concentrate. Plus, you're much more easily distracted than usual. You keep checking your email or phone messages, because you just can't seem to get absorbed in your work!

Be clear, open and honest, to the best of your ability. Sharing your thoughts, whether by talking them out or writing them down, is the best way to have your needs or expectations met.

You're making mental connections that were out of reach even just a day or two ago. Capitalize on this in any way you can! But your best bet is to set a goal for the next four weeks, and work to reach it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
