        "horoscope": "You're a humanitarian at heart, and today, your concern for the world rises. Seeing a stray animal by the road or hearing someone's hard luck story may inspire you to change things for the better. Stay with this line of thought. See where it takes you. It's possible that no practical ideas will emerge, since the current energy is highly idealistic. But perhaps something workable will come to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You're used to being in your head and living life through your thoughts and ideas. That's why today could be tricky for you. You're feeling more emotional than usual. Your mind may be full of images and impressions, but they're abstract at best. It's hard to make sense of them. Maybe you shouldn't even try. It's okay to have a day or two of fuzzy thinking and general confusion. Your wits will sharpen again soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You may feel less social today than you usually do. If so, there's no cause for concern. It's a good day to retreat from the world. Let yourself sleep in or take a nap, if you have time and you're so inclined. Read a book or do some reflective journal writing. Being quiet and sitting with your thoughts is a nice way to spend this subdued day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You're feeling everything extra deeply today. Your compassion is right at the front of your consciousness. Someone might tell you a story of their own struggles, and you'll feel their pain as if it's your own. It's a wonderful gift to have such sympathy for others. But you also have to work harder than others to establish solid personal boundaries. Find that balance today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Emotional vulnerability can be an issue today -- even for you, the courageous Lion. Life might seem a little too harsh, or, on the flip side, so sweet it makes your teeth hurt. Either way, you can experience a sense of disappointment or disillusionment. But if this happens, try to remember that it's just an impression, and a fleeting one. Your vigor and vitality will soon return.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "This may be a quiet, passive day. If your energy is a bit low now, take it easy. There's no need to push yourself. Instead, nurture yourself. Get some extra sleep. Leave physically vigorous tasks for another day. You may have trouble concentrating now, too, so hard work at the office may go out the window as well. The key now is to be gentle with yourself and others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You may be especially attracted to spiritual pursuits today. Meditation and yoga broaden your mind even as they calm and center your energy. Alternatively, a visit to a place filled with meaning -- a church or temple, a mountaintop, a grove of trees in a quiet forest -- may elevate you to a new level of spiritual awareness. Your mind, heart and soul are open and seeking today. Soak up this energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Take it easy if you feel a little tired today. It's difficult to focus right now. There's nothing wrong with letting your mind wander, or taking a nap if you need one. If you're at work, of course, this lack of concentration could present a problem. You won't get much accomplished if you keep staring out the window! Make up for your low productivity on another day, when you're feeling more alert.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Do something creative today. Your imagination is especially vibrant now, because your mind and heart are so open. Images and impressions rise to the surface of your consciousness like bubbles. Welcome them! They could spur an incredible work of art or literature. You're also more responsive than usual to music, poetry and artwork. Not artistic? You can enjoy taking in someone else's creation now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Today, you're experiencing life from a highly subjective perspective. Of course, you've always been an emotional being. But now your feelings are softer than usual. You might even feel a bit vulnerable, but this is a pleasurable sensation. It makes intimate moments with the people you love even more meaningful. In this state of mind, a beautiful song or a smile from a child has the power to soothe your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You're strongly compassionate today. It's a good thing you have such great inner strength and solid personal boundaries. Some people, under the current energy, open themselves up to those who would take advantage of their kindness. But that shouldn't be an issue for you. You're able to show your soft side to those who deserve it, and your strength to those who need it most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Today, life seems a little bit lovelier and more beautiful than usual. The way the morning sunlight shines in your bedroom window might really touch you. Or perhaps you'll be deeply moved by a story you see on the news of someone's struggle, or a piece of artwork you spot in a shop window. Your soul is open to revelation. You want to feel moved, and you probably will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
