But now that sort of self-focused effort isn't so important. It's time to expand your skills, and see what you can do for your community. It's likely that things are far from perfect around you, and as soon as you start searching for a way to pitch in, you'll find just the right one for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
