But your sensitivity may actually be the type that benefits everyone. You can pick up on others' feelings and needs without having to be told explicitly. If someone close to you is sad or anxious, you know instinctively, and you can offer them your support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

This could be challenging, if you're feeling anxious and you let your imagination run away with you.
