You're tuned in to interesting facts and figures, so you might discuss the morning paper over breakfast with a friend, or chat via email about the latest online headlines. Ultimately, these tidbits may not be all that important; they could be the equivalent of a crossword puzzle -- little more than an interesting distraction. But at least you're engaged in the world around you. That counts for a lot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Don't waste this day thinking you can't do it. Instead, remind yourself that you know all you need to know. Now is your chance to trust your gut to push you in the right direction. It's time to get going on a project or a relationship, and you can do that by taking direct action.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

At least it's real, which the people around you will appreciate, whether they agree with you or not. And you'll almost certainly feel cleansed once you get these thoughts out of your head and onto the table. How else can you determine which ones are viable? Bottling them inside will only make them stale, leaving you with a noticeable lack of energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Things people say to you today -- even their unconscious facial expressions -- could set you off emotionally. Instead of reacting without thinking, try to focus your self-awareness. Venture deeply into your own suppressed reasoning and desires. This careful introspection might make you nervous, or it might seem like a waste of time. But it will help you create positive change in your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Instead, strive for the kinder, gentler path. Being compassionate and accepting will make you feel good about yourself, whereas being grouchy or overly sensitive will only make you feel worse.

This is a great time for connecting with as many people as you can.

You can tell people about your life and ask them to relate their own stories. Maybe you'll come across someone who sparks an important idea, or simply end up with a new friend or two. But these good things will happen only if you pursue them, so be sure to reach out to other people now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Even if you're not in the right frame of mind to appreciate this basic truth, try not to generate any crises at work or among your friends today.

Ask a pal to go jogging, or just visit with a few of your favorite people over dinner. It feels good to reconnect.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
