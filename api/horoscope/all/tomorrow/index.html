It's more important simply to stay focused and keep working through to the end of a project. The best way to do this is to manage your time carefully and stay realistic about your output. A sensible approach to a project allows you to stick to the plan and adjust as you go along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Sloppy work won't cut it, either. Make a workable plan and then stick to it for the greatest efficiency. This may not leave much room for creativity or innovation, but it's only for a day. Toeing that line proves your maturity and dedication.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Or maybe that's just your personal focus, no matter what you're up to today. You're certainly in logic mode! Even small, mundane jobs or running errands are subjected to your detail-oriented rigor. At least it's kind of fun to be as efficient and yet thorough as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Focus is readily available, if you simply tap into it. You're able to set emotional concerns aside and concentrate on the basics. What needs to be done, and how are you going to do it? Best of all, your calmness and thoroughness are sure to satisfy even a nitpicky employer or client.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

To-do lists help, too -- plus, there's such a sense of satisfaction in crossing items off, one by one! This actually turns focused effort into a kind of game. How quickly can you work through your list? The sooner you're finished, the sooner you can relax.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Don't overextend yourself by expending too much energy. Don't take on more than you can realistically handle, either. Then you'd be disappointed in yourself for failing to accomplish something that wasn't going to happen in the first place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your instincts are excellent, but right now, logic wins out. All of this may go against your nature, but try to stick to it anyway.

What a waste of what could have been a very effective workday! Even if work doesn't sound like much fun, you'll find that once you get started, you slip into a rhythm.
