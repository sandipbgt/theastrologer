And on that note, it's a wonderful day for any kind of self-reflection that develops your awareness of the person you are deep down inside yourself. Therapy, journal writing and talking with intimate friends are all good paths toward self-discovery. So is studying astrology!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
