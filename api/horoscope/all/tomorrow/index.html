Show some backbone instead of erupting into a formless blob of angst. Go straight for the truth so that you can make your stand from solid ground, and attack from a good position. Maybe this all sounds like too much upheaval. Well, it's certainly not about hearts and flowers. But if you really want to get somewhere and things are blocking you, this is the best way to knock those obstacles down.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're in can-do mode, and you know how to bring the right kind of focused attention. Remember, though, to be fair as you deal with other people. You're the one who wanted equality, so make sure your own behavior is balanced.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
