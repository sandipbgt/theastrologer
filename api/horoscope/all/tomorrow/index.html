You may not get a lot accomplished today, at least not on the outside. But inside, your emotions are developing. Give yourself time to make sense of the images and feelings that come to you now. Soon, they may provide more inspiration than you expected.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

And reaching out to them isn't just for their sake. It's for yours, too. Take this opportunity to reaffirm the bonds that keep you close with family and friends. Days like this are what carry your relationships through rough spots and emotionally lean times.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Whatever personal agenda you may have seems unimportant in the face of your urge to connect with others in a simple, heartfelt way. It's also easier to resolve tensions. If someone has hurt you, you can forgive them now, once and for all. This clears not only thebetween you, but your own mind and heart.

You might fool people with your bold, courageous personality, but you can actually feel quite insecure. Today, that comes out in vague worries or a general sense of discouragement. Reality seems harsh. But remember, it's all a matter of perspective. Soon, you'll feel strong again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

The best you might be able to manage is just letting these emotions come, and sitting with them as they pass through. If you're lucky, some thought or image will make sense to you.
