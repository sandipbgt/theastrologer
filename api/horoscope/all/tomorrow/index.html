You need to know your hot buttons -- those issues and anxieties that other people might push, whether intentionally or unknowingly. Don't let intense energy get the best of you. No one's out to hurt you, but it could seem like they are. That's the kind of thing you have to watch out for now. A suspicious attitude won't serve you as well as an open, humble one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
