It's likely they didn't realize they were hurting your feelings. If you just can't get over it, you'll have to find a way to address the issue calmly and directly. Don't lash out or indulge in revenge fantasies -- simply tell them how you feel, and take it from there.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's likely that you're not remembering those moments clearly, and it's doubtful that they were your finest hour. Try focusing forward today.
