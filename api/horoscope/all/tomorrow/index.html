Even if you're chatting in a social setting with someone you've just met, you may find yourself asking probing, personal questions. With extreme tact, of course. It's all in your approach. And you're such a socially graceful person by nature, you'll find the right way to broach even the stickiest of subjects.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

A romantic moment could feel infinitely sweet, but a tense interaction could seem just as infinitely painful. Try to keep a sense of perspective, and stay as grounded as possible. If your feelings are intense, remember that it's only temporary. This should help you stay realistic.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You might be able to tell when a loved one is feeling stressed out or upset, even if you're far away from them. This is one of your natural gifts, and you should use it today to connect with others in a loving way. You need the sustenance of that emotional bond, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But hang in there if one develops today. Ride it out as you talk it out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
