People's attitudes are a bit more conservative than usual right now, especially when it comes to issues of appropriate behavior. If you make a bawdy joke, for example, you may be met with silence instead of laughter! Err on the side of tact and discretion, unless you're prepared to deal with criticism.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
