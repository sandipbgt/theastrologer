        "horoscope": "A reserved mood settles in today. You have a lot on your mind, but not in a bad way. In fact, the current energy is your favorite kind, because it helps you focus on the task at hand. Even problems aren't any trouble for you to manage, because you approach them more like puzzles in need of a solution. That logical perspective helps protect against getting emotionally involved, which usually just complicates things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But on a day like this, there's a lot to consider in the realm of reality -- your life as it actually is. Pay attention to the systems and routines of your daily life. Take it on as a personal challenge to become an efficiency expert, and make workable plans and improvements.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Be realistic today about your limits, plans and abilities. It's important to aim high under the current influence, but not so high that your goals are unattainable. That would just lead to feelings of disappointment in yourself. Being realistic from the start keeps your efforts in line with how much you can actually, reasonably accomplish, and it allows you to be human. If you need assistance, for example, ask for it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

That doesn't mean you should sweat it, but it's a savvy move to stay on top of details you might let slide on a different day. Of course, you don't want to drive yourself crazy. Plus, you're only human, which means you can only do so much.

Alternatively, your home might be in a state of severe neglect, because you choose to focus your attention on more important matters. But all of these issues are important.

A concentrated effort yields great results now, and a serious outlook is favored. This shouldn't be difficult to live up to, since currently you're more analytical than usual. Given your love of uncovering what was previously hidden, you could get quite absorbed in some pursuit today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

That outlook would drive some people crazy. In your case, it's just how you are -- logical, focused and with high expectations. Still, keep a sense of practicality about you.

Maybe your desk or your closet need some attention, or perhaps it's your diet that could use a little cleaning up.

You're cool-headed in a crisis, but the fact that you're moving so cautiously through the steps of a project means you probably won't encounter any major issues in the first place.

Instead of stopping for a friendly chat, they mutter something about needing to get back to work, and off they go. Don't take it personally. That's the current influence at work, boosting many folks' work ethics.
