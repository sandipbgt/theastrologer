        "horoscope": "It's a good day to do something requiring courage, because you've got a lot of moxie today. Your audacity is a force in itself; it's that dash of daring that helps you slide through rough spots and come out squeaky-clean. Other people watch you in action and only wish they could be so bold! Instead of using this up on silly feats of fearlessness that are ultimately pointless, apply it consciously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You may be in a situation today in which you have to think on your feet. If so, no worries -- your thoughts are quick, and it's much easier than usual to make speedy connections. You'll probably surprise yourself with the things that come out of your mouth! Of course, unrehearsed statements can have a downside, but you're a caring person. If you say something that comes out wrong, make quick amends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you have something to accomplish, you shouldn't have any trouble getting started. You have to do something with all that energy, after all! Following through on a project might be a different story, but you can cross that bridge when you come to it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you practice any calming discipline like meditation or yoga, these will be especially handy under the current influence. Even if you feel as if it's impossible to channel your thoughts and your spirit, the mere attempt to do so will help in itself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You may have a chance to perform an act of bravery, however big or small. Even drawing on your boldness in minor ways, such as talking to someone new or trying a new exercise class at the gym, feeds your inner courage, making it flare to life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Or will you ignore it in favor of your usual plans and logic? It's up to you. But sometimes, it's a good idea to let your hair down, just a little. On the other hand, when the energy from the cosmos is this unpredictable, caution may be best after all!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

While someone else might respond to the current energy by trying to dominate others, you're more likely to take charge in a teamwork-oriented way. If you're in charge of a group project, it's a savvy move to let others have as much autonomy as possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Hasty words or deeds could lead to problems, especially in formal or professional settings. It's important to maintain your positive connections with your clients or employer, not to mention your friends, coworkers or spouse. It may be a good idea to get a vigorous workout, to burn off some of that excess energy!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

At least it should be fascinating, even if it's a bit intimidating. It might even inspire you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
