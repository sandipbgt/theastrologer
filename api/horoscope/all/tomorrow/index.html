As long as you keep moving forward with eyes and ears wide open, you can create or become almost anything you can imagine. You'll rise above any inconveniences. Keep that optimism around you like a protective cloak.

But while you're expansive, you know your limits. Use that skill to pull it all together today. If you're focused on achieving a goal, you'll let your actions make a statement. That, in turn, will draw not just admirers to your side, but allies -- people who can help you get where you're trying to go.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The impression you're making may not be as positive as you'd like. It's time to shape up, even if you'd rather act like a rebellious teenager. Apologize to anyone whose feelings you've hurt recently, and focus on creating a warm, comfortable atmosphere around you. This will help you feel more like your regular, stable self in no time,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This is a good day for learning a new artistic technique or trying your hand at a new type of cuisine. If taking some classes or purchasing supplies is in order, don't be afraid to splurge. Check your budget, see what you can afford, and then have fun bringing something new into the world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This isn't just frivolous fun, you know. It's important, because it connects you with the person you love, or with your own vision of the relationship you hope to create. If romance is not your focus right now, you can still connect with others in a meaningful way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
