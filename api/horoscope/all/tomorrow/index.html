You might think you're seeing things more clearly than ever before, but your perspective is actually clouded by your own, strong needs and concerns. Until you sort through these, it will be tough to distinguish the right move or method from the wrong one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
