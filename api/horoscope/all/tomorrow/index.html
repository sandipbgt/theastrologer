But you may be just fine with getting things done on your own. You're more than capable of focus and hard work now, and you know it. Your commonsense view of things helps you figure out what to do first, and tackle it with ease.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You know what you believe in terms of right and wrong. Or do you? Now, circumstances put your principles to the test. You may find that some of your ideas don't hold up to a reality check. If so, it's okay. That's where learning and progress come in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And you're sensitive enough that even minor hardships make you nervous. But life isn't so uncertain as all that. And you're more adaptable than you give yourself credit for. It's smart to be prepared, but don't let your worries overwhelm you. Most of them never happen anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

With a structured approach, you can hardly go wrong.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That means spending your money carefully, or better yet, saving it. That also means budgeting your time wisely. Don't waste time chasing down false leads or tilting at windmills, so to speak. Base your thinking and your operations firmly in the here and now. Go with what works.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

These small acts of self-discipline might make life feel a little less bright and sparkly, but it's just for today.

You know what needs to be done and why, so it's easy to move forward. If at any point you do feel uncertain about how to proceed, focus on the bottom line. That might refer to cost -- right now, saving money is better than spending it. But generally, it refers to common sense, of which you have plenty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
