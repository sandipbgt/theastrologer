But if other people aren't responding to your leadership qualities, it may be time to take a step back and reevaluate things. Is it possible that you're coming across a little too strong? It might help to delegate tasks or ask others for their input. That way, everyone will feel involved.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
