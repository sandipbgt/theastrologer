You're full of ideas and picking up on social cues like a pro, which makes this the perfect time for parties, important meetings and any other gathering that requires you to shine. Staying 'on' for friends and strangers alike is almost sinfully easy. You're able to chat up the most serious, reserved person in the room, and have them loose and laughing in minutes. Can you think of a better way to put that silver tongue to work?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Whether you're consuming food, material items or ten more minutes on the snooze button, you're headed for major indigestion if you don't slow down. Take what you need, and no more. That's probably a lot less than you think. One way to judge is by looking to see how much the people around you are using.

Why not take a look at your budget and see if you can afford a trip to someplace you've never been before? This isn't as spontaneous as simply jumping in the car and taking off for parts unknown, but it offers its own sense of adventure. Besides,, you're too aware of the potential for running into snags to be at all irresponsible.
