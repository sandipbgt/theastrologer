If you truly think it is, try a shift in perspective. A one-sided argument may leave you even more unhappy than you're already feeling. Try compromising instead. That will cut through the bad emotions, plus you've put effort into getting along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
