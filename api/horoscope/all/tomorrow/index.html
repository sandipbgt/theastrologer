If you work in a visual field like photography or Web design, this can lend a certain flair to your work -- even if flair isn't what's needed! Add your personal touch to whatever you do, but be practical about it: Don't spend too much time or money doing so.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Let them know how much you appreciate their presence in your life. You don't have to do this in any overt way, like buying them flowers.

Even if you're the boss, it's important to give people autonomy and treat them with respect. The current emphasis is on compromise. Working together is much more effective than going solo, or worse, dictating orders and expecting others to comply. Instead, seek input from everyone.
