        "horoscope": "You feel passionately attached to your opinions today, even more so than usual. This can make it difficult to negotiate, especially if you're arguing with someone close to you, such as a family member or best friend. If someone disagrees with you, it can be deeply hurtful, almost like a personal rejection. And yet, logically, you know everyone is different. Remember that each person is entitled to their own point of view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You have a great deal of compassion for anyone who is feeling upset. You can see past anger to the hurt or loneliness that lies behind it. This is a true gift,. It enables you to reach out to someone instead of lashing out at them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Go deeply into a subject that interests you. You'll learn a great deal and discover unexpected parts of yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you're on your own, try some private self-reflection. Writing in a journal soothes your soul. Sifting through old letters or photographs may bring up bittersweet emotions, but the memories also remind you of how far you've come.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
