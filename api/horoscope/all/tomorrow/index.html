But for today, you're even better than usual at winning friends and influencing people. You can  draw heavily on your natural communicative ability. Why? Among other things, you have excellent taste, and everyone knows it. Friends, clients and coworkers are coming to you, asking for your advice on their various projects and situations. This is your time to shine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You may think you're experiencing troubles at work or with your sweetie or friends, but really, you're just temporarily stuck in a narrow world view. One way to decrease tensions is by broadening that view. Stop thinking you have all the answers, or that you need them immediately. It's okay to float a bit. Open your eyes and ask questions, even open-ended ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

When you're talking with your neighbor, don't worry about revealing too much about your emotional state. You're sweet and sympathetic enough that other people will want to treat you with the same kindness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
