It's nothing less than your zest for life, and it'll keep you alert and enterprising. Know which questions to ask and how to cash in on the answers right away. Visions will be hatched in the incubator of your dreams today, and they'll grow huge. Deals will be cut in corporate meeting rooms or down on the street.

        "horoscope": "You look down on those who are too well put together. It's like they're trying to imitate catalog models. And when they actually succeed, that's when you really let them have it. So what's your issue with accepting the standards of fashion? Maybe the problem is that your own appearance is getting a little slovenly. Maybe you don't care at all, but on the other hand, maybe you care a lot. Don't deny what bothers you if you can fix it. Spend the day sprucing up. But make a point of looking like yourself, not someone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Just use diplomacy to get where you're going. Others may already be on edge for reasons that have nothing to do with you. Don't go rolling over them now. Because if you don't push them over that edge, they might turn around and come after you. This sounds pretty hostile. So instead of starting trouble along the way, use your good will to get you where you're going.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're so weighed down with words that letting them out under these circumstances will seem reasonable. Well, everyone gets to have their opinion. But opinions won't count for much if you're running old software or operating on an outdated model. So think twice before you go around pulling the plug on others. Would you pack it in and go home if somebody told you to? Of course not.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Solve complex equations over the course of a friendly conversation. Crack impossible codes with a smile and a casual wave of the hand. There's no trick to any of this. It's just your skill set finally bearing fruit. Share what you have and show how it's done. Even if you give away your secrets, it's not like anyone else could actually compete with you in this area. They're welcome to try, though.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's just that something big, whether it's a childhood issue or a present day concern, will have your feet to thetoday. Well, that's better than letting the whole thing go to your head, isn't it? Remain upright no matter what. This may not be the most comfortable way to live, but as long as you have to force the situation, you might as well force it in the right direction.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Be the moderator, mediator or go-between when other parties fail to understand each other, or refuse to even be in the same room. Sure, it's a community service for members who don't operate at your level, but you have your reasons for being so diplomatic. The right people will see those reasons and know what you're up to.

You might get a kick out of watching everyone around you muddle through their mini-upheavals and other dramas today. Do your best to internalize your laughter. After all, some people -- okay, lots -- might not share your sense of humor about this strange, silly, all-too-human aspect of life. They might think your laughter is directed at them rather than at their situation, which will only hurt their feelings or put them on the defensive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

OK, maybe that's extreme, but it's still a good idea to be strong and restrain yourself today. It'll be a lot harder avoiding the bad stuff than surrendering to temptation. But instead of dwelling on self-denial, think about the good behavior you're modeling. You have to admit that self-control looks pretty cool in an out-of-control world. And after you're out of the danger zone, you'll be free to cut loose again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Perhaps you've been struck by a bolt of genius and you have something completely new in mind. For now, it's best to temper your wild visions with some common sense. Don't go rushing into something brand-new and untested. You're too cautious for that, anyway, and this just isn't the moment. Instead, preserve order and dignity for another day.

It's OK to deviate from the pattern, no matter what the poll numbers or focus groups are saying. Most people only know what they can see, and they see where they're told to look. But your sharp eyes are all over the place. And right now the coolest opportunities are far off the beaten path.

You'd like to think you have only the best intentions, but in reality you might just be going with your animal programming. Expect to feel the pull of desire's abrupt demands today. It's OK if this makes you uneasy. That shows you're paying attention and that you know your individuality from your id. Or, if you don't want to get all Freudian about it, try separating who you are from what your body wants in the moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
