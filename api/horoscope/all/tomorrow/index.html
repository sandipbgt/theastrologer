        "horoscope": "Your observant eye is sharp today. You're noticing minor details that might normally slip past you, or which you might usually file under 'no big deal.' It's not that they're a big deal now, either. It's that you can see the way many small details add up to create the big picture. This is a good thing, because it enables you to tweak things at that small-scale level, and positively affect the overall result.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You can sense intuitively that you need to be attentive to the task at hand, and yet, your mind wanders. Or you might feel overwhelmed by all the details you have to keep track of, so you shut down completely. Ask for help if you need it.
