        "horoscope": "Everyone around you seems bent on small talk today. You want to talk, too, and trade ideas, but mindless chatter annoys you to no end. It's a good day for a deep, heart-to-heart talk with a trusted friend, or a session with your counselor. You're making quick intellectual connections, and you could end up discovering something very interesting about yourself. Talk it out,. Don't keep secrets today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Your energy is far from grounded today, and this could be a distinctly uncomfortable state of mind. But you're full of creative ideas, so try to find a way to center yourself and keep playing with the words and images that come to you. Don't be surprised if you're flat-out frazzled by the end of the day. It's understandable, considering all the conversations and other interactions you'll have with people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You'll have a lot of fun talking with people and using your natural charm. But if you do need to focus, it could be tough. At least harness your many creative ideas by writing them down, so you won't forget them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It doesn't matter how high your energy might be or how much pressure you're putting on yourself to perform to an impossible standard. Give yourself a break,!

All it takes is one good question and you're off, racing along a mile a minute.

Your head is filled with creative ideas, and you definitely need to talk them out with like-minded people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
