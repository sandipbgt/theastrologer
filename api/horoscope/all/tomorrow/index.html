        "horoscope": "Today should be fairly mellow. You're feeling on top of things. You don't have a particular need to boast about your successes or overindulge in your favorite sensations or flavors, as you sometimes do. No, you're on an even keel, mindful of your health and your limits. And that very quality could easily turn today into an occasion. Whatever happens, make sure you savor the welcome break from the usual frenzy of life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Wait a minute -- are you brooding? You're normally so happy-go-lucky, so carefree, so optimistic! But at the moment, you're a little too single-minded about your difficulties. Maybe that explains it. Time to put yourself to the test. Branch out and prove to yourself that your problems aren't nearly as big as you're currently making them out to be. One important part of this might be to get some exercise, as simple as that sounds.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Even more importantly, don't let anxiety affect your health. Whatever you're worried about, it's not worth high blood pressure, interrupted sleep, or even the scattered focus and general insecurity you have now. The good news is, you'll calm down soon.

What's wrong with simply saying what you're thinking and feeling? If that seems overly selfish or just out of line, push yourself to compromise. Giving a little in order to gain a little won't be that bad, and it's certainly preferable to out-and-out rebellion, which just isn't likely to work in your favor today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
