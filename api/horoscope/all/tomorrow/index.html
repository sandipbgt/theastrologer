But you're going to hit obstacles in the form of other responsibilities, other people's agendas, and maybe even their flat-out refusals. Listen to them instead of trying to barrel on ahead. Enthusiasm is great, but not if it's fueled by misdirected aims or unconscious desires, and that's a distinct possibility now. Time to check yourself before you wreck yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

In fact, maybe it's you that's being a stick in the mud. Why else would you need such frequent stimulation? It's time for a little focus, which shouldn't be too hard. You'll be glad you did -- you can make something dull and routine shine once again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

They're probably a little peeved at you today -- instead of staying calm and working with them, you're letting yourself get all uptight and controlling. Change might make you a little jumpy today, but dive in, even if it seems like a challenge. It's called 'personal growth.' You can do it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're seeing innocent comments from friends or coworkers as mean little jabs, but that's just your mood. No one is out to get you.
