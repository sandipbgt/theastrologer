        "horoscope": "Instead of bossing everyone around today and putting them in their places with sarcasm, try to stop and face your own emotions. You're a bit on the domineering side,. That's what comes with being a natural leader. But you're taking it a little over the edge at the moment. If you slow down and consider what's going on inside your head and your heart, you'll find you're actually feeling very uneasy. Try to get back in touch with the reasons why you do what you do, and see if it's time to change anything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Stick to the facts for now. If you want to get off on the right foot, try not to make wild guesses about strangers. Project a cautious, measured version of yourself until you know who you're dealing with. Inner turmoil is your private business, so don't go looking for new shoulders to cry on. And if you're bubbling over with the good stuff, you should only share it with those who can appreciate it. Maintaining this tough exterior might not be such a picnic, but it probably won't matter after today. Plus, you'll get points for self-control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You'll negotiate with friends and associates, and try to finish projects with an eye for detail and balance. This is a special talent of yours, so things should go well. Using this skill may turn your luck around. Can you think of ways to make this sort of behavior a habit?

Your craftsmanship shines brightly today. If you're in a creative field, this is the perfect time to start developing an exciting new line. You're both a master and a perfectionist at the moment.

Work on clearing out your past junk today. It'll be a relief, but it'll also be a first step.

Cooperation becomes difficult as that stubborn streak of yours intensifies, making everyone feel uncomfortable. The question is, do you know what you want, or are you just rebelling? The latter is likely. You want to get people worked up, since you're feeling uneasy yourself. But a better approach would be to take a few deep breaths and remind yourself to stay on track.

It's hard to call something 'good enough' when you're not convinced that 'good enough' exists. Give everyone time before you quit. You can afford to be patient.

Don't waste time on pretense; instead, be as vulnerable and softhearted on the outside as you are inside.
