        "horoscope": "There are times when you like to dig deep, move slowly and find a place for all who want to play. Right now, though, you're more interested in quick solutions and brisk brush-offs. It's as if you can't be bothered with trudging down that same old road again. You're going off the beaten track even if you already know that won't get you there any faster. Well, it's a style, if you want to call it that, but not everyone will face the same challenges this way. Be ready for a day of compromise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "For someone who doesn't always have both feet on the ground, you seem to know exactly where you stand. That would be a few heads taller than everyone else. How can you be so unworldly yet so arrogant? How can you be an eccentric who wants to be at the center of it all? Today you'll discover the answers for whatever questions are tugging at you. Be ready for the light they'll cast across your unspoken motives, and be sure you're proud of something that's still real.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Whether you're in a business situation or all wrapped up in your personal life, it's best to treat others like gold, even if you secretly can't wait to scrape them off your shoes. It's a matter of principle. Retire from rude society for the day. Let them be impolite without you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But today, concentrate those efforts on practical, unremarkable tasks. You'll impress people most simply by putting your energy into something worthwhile, and especially by tying up loose ends on a project. Others value your wisdom, you know. Not everyone is as advanced in their understanding of systems and processes as you are.

Or if those words sound too civilized for you, just think of yourself as more fun than anyone. Work the room and light up the sky for another day. Behave like the silly animal that you are. Keep the magic going with the firm belief that everybody's your friend and no one would dream of hijacking the party for their own selfish purposes. Maybe you'll be right this time.

Your focus should be on stabilizing people and situations, not upsetting them -- no matter how much better lashing out might make you feel in the moment. In the long run, it would only make things worse, and in your heart of hearts, you know that. So take deep, calming breaths today, and try to inspire everyone around you to do the same.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

When you're in the grip of divine inspiration, everything's cool and anything goes, whether that means passionate one-on-one time or standing alone on a mountain somewhere. Of course, your inner condition will be obvious to the outer world. Who could miss something like this? And if others come along to bask in your bright light today, will you complain? What a concept!

Maybe you've noticed how certain things are in short supply. Even if you're good on the material stuff, everyone could always use more patience and better manners. Be less demanding today. Speak without accusing, and if you can't do that, don't speak at all. These are useful exercises in self-control.

It's your day to really and truly make your point. But don't kill the conversation by turning up the volume.

Strangers will know about your good works. But just as you start setting up shop, the wind of popular demand will shift. Why can't it stay this way?

Well, how would you know that when you jump each time someone moves in your direction? Aren't these people supposed to be your friends? Lay off the caffeine today. Get more sleep and exercise.
