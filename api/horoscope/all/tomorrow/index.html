But don't let wishy-washiness throw you off balance. Just enjoy the deluge of images that comes as you interact with other people. There's no reason you should have to codify all that information right now. You can make sense of it later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your work goes well, especially if you're in a field related to information, communication or customer relations. Reading books and articles is especially fun now, too. One idea sparks another, and soon you're piecing together a captivatingly interesting puzzle.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Speaking of which, you're in quite a playful mood, keeping things light with friends and coworkers. Silly, flirty exchanges, whether in person or via email or Instant Message, are a lot of fun.

But sometimes it's good to lighten up. You tend to have a naturally deep focus. Why not go surface-level for a while? Trade jokes and quips with your coworkers. Blow off some steam. Then you can dig deeply again into your project, past, emotions or what have you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's easier at the moment, since abstract emotions and images are more readily translated. If you have to address a sticky situation with a friend or coworker, a wry, dry sense of humor will help. Making a joke at your own expense softens up the other side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
