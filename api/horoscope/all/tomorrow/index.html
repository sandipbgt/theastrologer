If you try to connect with others in your usual, warm way, you may end up feeling rebuffed. If so, don't take it personally. Many people are consumed by ideas right now, and interpersonal connections just aren't as compelling as usual. Trust that those bonds remain strong, and they'll do just that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
