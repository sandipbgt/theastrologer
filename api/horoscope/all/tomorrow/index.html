But can you blame them for wanting to have a little fun? The whole world is in a warm, playful mood. Just because you're the impatient one doesn't mean you should unleash your inner beast or critic. Tone it down. Give people space to be their silly selves.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
