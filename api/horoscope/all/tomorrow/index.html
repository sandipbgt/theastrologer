It's a great day to ask your friends or business associates for help. Getting others' perspectives or their support is a smart way to operate. Just don't let conflicting opinions throw you off. In the end, your opinion is the one that matters most.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're like a work of art in motion -- bright, compelling and attractive to everyone! This is a great opportunity, but a brief one, so take advantage of it. You can mix with any social group now, or gain the support of any professional associate.

        "horoscope": "The best expression of the current energy would be to bounce from one party or gathering to another, stopping just long enough at each to talk and make connections. But even if you're stuck at the office, you can promote this kind of party atmosphere. Chat with people in the break room, or tell a joke to lighten up a meeting. At home, tell stories or play word games with your family.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Togetherness and harmony are even more important today than usual. But any feelings of irritation or resentment lurking beneath the surface of your relationships could mar an otherwise lovely day. Bottling up your feelings rarely works out. You have to process them in your own way, whether that means talking them out or withdrawing until you feel better. Just remember to choose your battles.

You get along well with everyone, because you understand just where each person is coming from. And you're interested in harmony with everyone you meet. It's a great day to serve as the glue that holds a group of friends or a team of coworkers together.

But today it's especially important to support the group rather than pushing an individual agenda. Teamwork is important in a tactical sense, too. If you're willing to throw your efforts behind someone else's project, they'll be more likely to do the same for you in the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Unified efforts are more effective than solo ones now, and they're more fun, too. In that vein, it's a great day for launching any type of partnership, whether personal or professional in nature -- as long as you do your research first, of course!

Putting your own needs last is okay when it comes to your children, or when your needs truly aren't that important. But when it comes to working out larger issues with your equals, don't be so quick to back down. Surely there's a way to balance this out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

And you're willing to do just about anything to get it! Obviously, a friendly, accepting approach is a great way to draw people toward you. Brash, crass or noisy behavior, on the other hand, is a good way to push them away. Choose wisely,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Of course, making that sort of tradeoff rarely feels worth it for long. Your opinions and point of view are what make you who you are.
