Start a far-reaching project. Maybe you'll commit a month to this, or maybe you could set aside an even bigger block of time. But even if you're just dabbling or doodling, you're good on inspiration. Ask around for the materials if you don't see what you want. You might end up with people as well as supplies, and imagine what you could do if you all joined forces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You, on the other hand, understand it very well, and under normal circumstances, you're a natural at handling your passions gracefully. Today, though, that could be a little trickier. You're off balance, working at cross purposes with yourself, getting in your own way. Figure out how to balance elegance with satisfaction today. If anyone can do it, it's you. Just try to stay calm if things don't go your way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This may be contrary to your usual energy levels, but wild activity and a full schedule wouldn't be realistic right now. Today is far better suited for sitting back and finding solutions to a problem or analyzing a situation, and giving it your full brain power. Since you're intellectual by nature, it's easy for you to get into this. You know you can think now and act later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you chance upon a golden opportunity at work, team up so you can all reap the benefits. You'll find that plenty of doors swing open for you now, and you can afford to be gracious.

It's part of something bigger, like not losing your social or spiritual cool in a tense situation. See where this is going?

There has to be a better way of reaching out to friends, neighbors and random strangers on the street. Don't incite them. Invite them.
