Isn't there an empire somewhere you should be building? Stay generous with your energy and hope for a feedback loop. Make everyone your friend today so that you'll get back some of what you're putting out. Set these people onwith your vision and intellect.

You need the big picture today, not an interior or micro-scale view. Once you pull out to the broader view, you'll find there's a whole lot to see and take in -- so much that you won't have to act for a while.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

See if they'll actually follow you today, and whether it's out of curiosity or maybe even loyalty. And maybe, before it's all over, you could even have them worshipping at your feet.
