Your instinct is to let them think what they will. But try to be civil, even if you're feeling pressured. You never know when you may need someone's help, and it will be more forthcoming if they feel you've been treating them well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're focused on the future, and you're putting plans in place -- plans that are at once modern and rooted in tradition. This is your secret weapon today: using your innate creativity where it's appropriate, but relying on established structures when you need to.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

While taking a cool, unemotional view of things isn't your normal way, it may be the best way for now, especially if your money or reputation is involved.

Buckling down to work is no fun when you can't make social calls or listen to music, and something about today's energy just feels heavy. But maybe that's a sign that you should concentrate on your responsibilities. After all, not every day can be packed with fun, and you have to take care of business sometime.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The kind of energy at work today calls for a traditional, cautious approach to problem-solving and personal advancement.

You look at any mess with the eye of an architect, and quickly determine how to build up its crumbling foundation or increase its efficiency. In no time, you've got everything wrapped up in a neat, and you're ready to move on to the next crisis. That's just how you work,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're working toward stability at the very least, and perhaps a solid reputation, too. There's a lot of power in being this determined -- and not just when your employer is looking, either.
