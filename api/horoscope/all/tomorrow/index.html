        "horoscope": "You might go head to head with someone today over a certain situation or project. Maybe you want something different than what others want. Differences of opinion are normal, and you're entitled to your own feelings and needs. You should still check in with the others and see if you can find a compromise. You'll feel much better about yourself if you adopt a cooperative attitude instead of pushing your own agenda on everyone else.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Today you're even better than usual at making other people feel at home. Why? Because their comfort genuinely matters to you. Plus helping them feel more comfortable puts you right where you want to be: moving toward your own goals. No, this isn't manipulative, it's practical. You need your friends and associates, and they need you. It's a 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' situation, and there's nothing wrong with that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You're trying to push someone into the corner, so they'll eventually have to push back. And then what? When it comes to senseless conflict, no one wins. If you just want to blow off a little steam, go for a run, or punch out a few rounds on the heavy bag at the gym. With friends and work mates, try stating your needs in a calm, direct way. That approach is guaranteed to have better results than the other, more manipulative one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Escapism is an inherently selfish act, but you probably won't see it that way today. Instead, it seems necessary, because you're entrenched in full-on self-protection mode as you face down a stressful, confusing situation. The thing is, no one is threatening anything of yours that truly matters. Try to recognize that fact, as soon as you can. That way, you'll be able to relax, face this issue down and resolve it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Start brainstorming new ideas and get excited about your plans, and spend some time clearing the decks. Focus on staying healthy and happy while various elements in your life finish sorting themselves out. Don't worry -- it'll happen, and soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But while self-discipline is good, you need to make time to relax, too. And who deserves it more than you? It's your turn to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Today is a great time to spend a bit of your hard-earned cash on something frivolous. Tomorrow will be back to the coal mine!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The good news is, people are still able to sense your energy and abilities. If you have a job interview or any other type of audition lined up, rely on basic lessons of public comportment: Sit up straight, smile, and answer questions directly, with confidence. That should carry you through just fine.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Yes, you're sure to be on everyone's 'it' list today. Your friends adore you, because you're so dashing under pressure. And you'd never admit this to them, but it doesn't even feel like pressure!

You think you're seeing clearly, when really you're viewing your life and relationships through a filter of unconscious feelings and needs. Remember that before you renounce the old ways. It would be far better to wait a few days before making any major decisions, because things might change in the meantime, starting with your point of view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And here's the real point: Why miss out on all the fun? Instead of brooding over something that's in the past, look for something to smile about. Odds are, there are a lot of wonderful people and experiences just waiting for you to appreciate them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
