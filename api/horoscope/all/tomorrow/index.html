        "horoscope": "Going out of your way to be kind to others is a smart move today. Most people are feeling a lot more sensitive and sentimental than usual. And that includes you! Putting out positive energy helps ensure that it comes back to you. Besides that, your friends and coworkers will appreciate your efforts to make room for their feelings. Even if you aren't feeling thin-skinned, they are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Today it's important to recognize and accept your feelings. You might think you have no time for silly emotion, especially if you have a lot on your plate. But the more you try to ignore your feelings, the more insistent they become. It's better to go ahead and take the time to get in touch with your inner self, the part of you that experiences life not through logic and reason but pure emotion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're such a nurturer by nature that you can't help but get involved when you sense someone is feeling hurt, scared or alone. You can be a great source of comfort to them. But it's also tough to take on others' burdens. Do your best to strike a self-protective balance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's also a great day to connect with someone you adore, but don't take it personally if they don't seem as head-over-heels about you as you feel about them! They're probably feeling the connection just as strongly; they just aren't expressing it with your dramatic, demonstrative flair.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It also includes that invisible thread that keeps you tuned in to other people at a level that sometimes seems psychic. That extrasensory awareness is keen right now. You might receive strong impressions and feelings that seem to come from nowhere. You're probably 'borrowing' them from someone else!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Tension is even less appealing than usual, which means right now you'll do whatever it takes to avoid conflict. But what if a situation arises in which you really need to put your foot down?

You're in a strong place emotionally, but not everyone is right now. You might end up being someone's source of nurturing care. And that's okay with you.
