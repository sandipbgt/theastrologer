But now, you're unwilling to take a stand, even on important issues. You just want everyone to get along, so you're willing to step back and let someone else have their way if they're more assertive than you are. That's fine, as long as you aren't giving up something truly important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's nice to sift through old photos or recollections of the past, even if the feelings that come up are bittersweet in nature. The flow of time seems especially precious now.
