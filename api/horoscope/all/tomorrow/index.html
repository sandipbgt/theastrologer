        "horoscope": "Anything you do today is better accomplished as a team. Group effort is favored now, and you'll find that working closely with other people toward a common goal truly yields great results. If nothing else, it reminds you that you aren't alone in this world. So ask a neighbor to pitch in on a landscaping project, or recruit coworkers to help you brainstorm a proposal. Get people involved, and build that community glow!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's wonderful to get involved with a charity or a cause, as long as you don't overextend yourself. You have a tendency to give and give and give -- until you have nothing left for yourself!

You have a perfectionist streak, which sometimes prevents you from testing out new ideas or methods. Don't limit yourself in that way now.
