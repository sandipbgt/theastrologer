In fact, today marks the beginning of a new personal cycle for you. The emotions washing through you indicate where you need to focus your energy for the next month. For example, if you're feeling sentimental about your family, you should make plans to visit them or to keep in better touch.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
