Retract and remain aloof. To use another animal kingdom metaphor, waspish outbursts will invite stinging retorts today. But either way, quiet or noisy, reexamine your behavior. Leave the building if you can't stand the people, but try giving them the benefit of the doubt one last time. They might actually surprise you with their kindness, humor and intelligence. Then you could lose the attitude.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It all joins together into one smooth dance. Anyone who sees this whole thing will want to dance with you. It's your day to access life on many levels.
