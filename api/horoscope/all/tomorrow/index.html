But everyone seems distracted and more in the mood for superficial conversation than for anything meaningful. When it comes to hard work or in-depth research, you may be on your own for now.

Diversity is important now, even if it means more chaos and less focus than you'd prefer. If you can coach yourself to tolerate seemingly foolish or hasty behavior, you might find there's actually a method to others' madness.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
