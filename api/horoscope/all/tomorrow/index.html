        "horoscope": "If you're still feeling a little cranky today, keep on waiting out this mood as gracefully as possible. Get some gentle exercise to help burn off some of the tension. At home, keep your snacking to a minimum, because the tendency runs strong now to solve emotional issues with flavors and textures. Of course, there's nothing wrong with indulging in a scented bubble bath or a luxurious nap. These could help you stay centered.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Recent changes are throwing you off today, but try not to let them bother you so much. Play it safe until you know a little more about what's going on. Caution is almost always better than getting critical and upset. Honesty is a good approach, too, especially if you're feeling insecure. It's hard for you to open up about your feelings of vulnerability, but doing just that will have the best results now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

With some careful focus, you could even harness this tricky energy to get something accomplished. Be sure to hit the gym or the trail, even just for a short, quick workout. Working up a sweat will help you keep your temper under control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Thank goodness it's a slow-paced day, so you can be as sedate as you want, whether you're at work or at home. Enjoy your loved ones and your private time. A good movie on DVD, some popcorn or a few chocolates, and a friend or your sweetheart lounging on the couch by your side -- now, that sounds like a fun afternoon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You can get a lot accomplished in these personal realms, especially if you stay on task. Here's a prediction: In just a day or two, your house will be cleaner, you'll have reached out to a loved one over the phone or in person, and you'll be feeling pretty good about your life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you stop and think about it, you'll realize there's nothing to protect yourself against. Your life is going pretty well, and you have good friends and a support system in place to help you through the rough spots. Focus on these positives instead of any negatives you may be experiencing. You'll get through this with flying colors.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And a certain amount of indulgence is certainly in order on a quiet afternoon at home. Just make sure you aren't eating extra calories to fill an emotional void. If there are feelings in your heart that need addressing,them in your journal or with a friend.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Write down your thoughts and perceptions in your journal, so you can reread them later. If you're creatively inclined, you could make a collage that taps into your subconscious mind. Just don't give in to a morose mood. Moping around is so not your style.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your family seems especially dear to you, and being at home has never felt more comfortable or secure. Even if you have to work, spend some time on the couch or in the kitchen, or call an old, dear friend and catch up on what's been happening in both your lives.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If your nostalgia is sweet, then enjoy it. But if it makes you melancholy, turn your focus firmly toward the present. Today marks the start of a new personal cycle for you, so resolve to move forward in your life. It's a whole new day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Perhaps you'll resolve to be more active in your local community group, or to do more for your family. Best of all, any actions along these lines provide a great example for the other people in your life. They can learn from watching you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
