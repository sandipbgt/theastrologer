        "horoscope": "You're happy but restless today. Working quietly at your desk isn't an option, unless your work involves surfing the Net or answering emails or phone calls. As long as you're engaged in conversation -- or, better yet, several conversations at once -- you're content. But as soon as the phone stops ringing or your coworkers return to their own cubicles, you find yourself drumming your fingers and itching for stimulation. It's just one of those days.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Networking opens doors for you, so be chatty and witty, but with a purpose.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
