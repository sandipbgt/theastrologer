        "horoscope": "High energy could make you restless today. But if anyone knows how to channel this edgy, dynamic vibe, it's you. You have the focus and determination needed to turn a good idea into something truly creative -- and actually feasible. Bring this skill to your day job, your hobby or your passion. You'll enthrall your friends and business associates as you blaze ahead with brilliance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Lots of people feel scatterbrained today. So if you're having trouble concentrating on the task at hand, you aren't alone. Just do your best to focus. And if that's simply impossible, adjust your activities to accommodate your attention span. For example, running several quick errands may be more productive than tackling one project that requires close attention. That is, unless you end up driving in circles around town!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're the first person to get a joke or solve a puzzle. You grasp new concepts quickly and easily, so if you're taking a class or teaching yourself a new subject, you could take several strides forward now.

        "horoscope": "Quick thinking and interesting conversations keep you on your toes today. You're talking, laughing, and really coming out of your shell. This could be quite enjoyable, but it could also make you nervous. Be sure to cater to your emotions and energy level. If you need some alone time, take it -- even if you have to steal a few quiet moments to decompress somewhere in private.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Today might be a lot of talk but very little action. You're full of ideas, but the motivation it takes to carry them out is a separate issue. Why not use today to plan a project? You can network with supportive people and brainstorm creative ideas. Toss strategies around, and don't limit yourself to mundane concerns like practicality or available resources. That can come later. For now, just let your mind run.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "High energy makes you especially attentive and expressive today. Suddenly, you're noticing nuances of wit or language you might ordinarily miss. You always appreciate a good joke, but now you're drawn to sharply intelligent humor. Take in a political satire or a 'mockumentary,' or to read a book or article that challenges your intellect. It's just so enjoyable to revel in ideas now, and explore them past their boundaries.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Conversations speed ahead in fits and starts -- and you may notice that you aren't actually communicating all that much, despite the information exchange. Oh, well. If you can't focus, it's just the effects of today's lunar energy. It will pass soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Best of all, you're smart enough to know which ones are fanciful and which just might work. So enjoy the exciting, kinetic vibe that both fills you and swirls around you now. Put it to good use.

It's a good idea to keep a notebook or voice recorder nearby, so you can record any strokes of brilliance. This is perfect if you're in the planning stages of a project. You're extra creative now, and not as limited as usual by issues of practicality. You can worry later about whether your ideas will hold.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

In fact, you might get so caught up in trying to get something across to a friend or business associate that you actually become obsessive about it. Try to avoid this! And be sure to listen as well as pushing your own ideas or needs across.

You might find yourself nervously tapping your fingers when working quietly at your desk, or talking a mile a minute instead of listening carefully. Some days are just like this. Blow off steam with physical exercise or a few minutes of deep breathing. Or, tailor your day to match your mood. Making phone calls or running errands helps you maximize this energy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

This is one of those days when you might learn something important, or make plans for the future. But it's more likely that you'll simply have several enjoyable interchanges with other people -- discussions that make you think and jokes that make you laugh.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
