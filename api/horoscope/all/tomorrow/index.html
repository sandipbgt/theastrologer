You're seeing the humor in all things, and the connections that exist between seemingly unrelated elements. You could come up with some truly mind-blowing ideas. If you're a philosopher or a poet, an engineer or an inventor, be sure to take notes as the brain waves come. You wouldn't want to lose these ideas!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You might describe a vacation idea to a friend, and moments later, you're making plans to go there. Or you might mention an idea you've been formulating, and before you know it, you have a team and a plan in place. When kinetic energy takes over like this, all you can do is run with it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You may sense that you're going to have to step in and be the one who keeps things grounded and sane, because the people around you may seem a little flakey. But there's a difference between recklessness and blowing off steam. Cut others some slack. In fact, why not have a little fun yourself?

Get out and about and talk to people. Brainstorm ideas for a professional or creative endeavor. And remember, go big. No plan is too 'out there' -- not today. Soon you can work on feasibility issues.

It's certainly more important to listen, learn and absorb than to push your own ideas on others.

Letting your body wander is wonderful now, too, if you can afford the time away from work, responsibilities and your regular life. If you can't take a trip somewhere, take a mental vacation with a good book or a movie.
