You're used to thinking creatively, so it shouldn't be too difficult to take a leap of faith in your ideas. And oh, the benefits you'll reap. This is especially favorable if you work in a creative field, but following your intuition now is a positive thing regardless.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The good thing is, you actually enjoy moody, subjective days like this. Your emotions are your strength and your identity. Deep feelings make you feel connected with the world around you.
