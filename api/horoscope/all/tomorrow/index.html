        "horoscope": "You'll experience a distinct softening of the heart today. Emotional matters count far more now than your work or anything else that's rooted in logic. If you've experienced any tension or distance with a friend, it's a great day to bridge that gap. Extend a loving, supportive hand. Open up about your feelings. If there's any lesson to be learned today, it's that there is strength in vulnerability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Daydreaming may be the best you can do at the moment! And it can bring on highly creative ideas, if you make space for them. Then, when you're feeling more energetic, you can see if they're actually viable in the real world.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's wonderful to have this kind of compassionate attitude toward your own weaknesses or someone else's. This is the kind of gentle perspective that builds your connection with friends and family.

Serving others soothes your soul, too. Feed your family a home-cooked meal or give a child a hug. Selfless acts have a way of rebounding back to you.

Instead, being this in touch with your feelings brings a sense of inner calm. Sometimes it's nice to match up your ideas with their more subjective counterparts. It lets you know why you think the way you do. And this is a creative breeding ground for truly innovative theories and plans.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
