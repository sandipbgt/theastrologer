But now, a more emotional approach is needed. Folks benefit less from your fix-it advice than from your sympathetic ear. That kind of closeness sometimes makes you nervous. But if you push yourself to be there for someone, there will be rewards for both of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You might feel extra tender toward a loved one, or especially nurturing. You want to share others' burdens and help heal their emotional wounds. Since you're such a strong, solid person, you stand a great chance of really making a difference in someone's life, or at least their day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
