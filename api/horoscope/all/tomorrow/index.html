        "horoscope": "You'll find it easier than usual to access your deepest emotions today. You crave closeness, and intimacy which is readily available now, if you simply reach out for it. If you spend one-on-one time with your sweetheart, expect some serious fireworks! Self-analysis is also highly enjoyable and productive. You could experience an epiphany about your needs or your past, allowing you to grow leaps and bounds in a single day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "In your closest relationships, you tend to back down in the face of stronger personalities. It's just not worth the conflict to fight with someone for the upper hand. At the same time, you have a keen sense of balance -- the give and take that makes a relationship work. Today, that balance is highlighted. You may have to make the tough choice to engage in a power struggle, even if you'd rather not.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Other people may not have such a facility as you have for shining a light into the darkest corners of their souls. Encourage someone to go through this process, or delve into it yourself.

And yet, if you take an honest look inside yourself, you may realize that your sensitive spots -- those buttons you don't want anyone to push -- come from anxieties you have about yourself.

You may come into contact with someone who seems very controlling, or who pushes your buttons in some deep way that you may not even fully understand. Your natural reaction might be to snap at them or push back in some way, but it would be better to temper your own actions, even if you believe they're out of line.

You don't mind unpleasantness or bad behavior, as long as it's real. Still, avoid unhealthy or destructive people. That includes self-destructive behavior like spending time with anyone who doesn't treat you with caring respect. Honesty doesn't have to be painful!
