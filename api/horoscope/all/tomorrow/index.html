Just accept your buoyant mood and don't go punching holes in it with hard questions. Let happy memories float your boat. Dare to dream about sailing away to impossible futures. And the best part is that you can do it all with one foot firmly planted onshore. Yes, at least for today, you can be ecstatic and reasonable. There's no conflict, and there won't be any mess to clean up, either.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Isolation is also a byproduct of this mood. Perhaps you're feeling lonely and misunderstood, as if no one in the world 'gets' you at your core. But you have just as many friends and admirers as you did yesterday. Try to connect with some of them.
