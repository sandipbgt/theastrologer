That could be tough for you to do, especially if your feelings are hurt. But being able to focus on what's most important -- working harmoniously together -- shows an impressive level of maturity. And you'd much rather work together than have to strike out on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
