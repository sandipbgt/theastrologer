That strut of yours looks spontaneous to everyone else, even if you know what's beneath it. 'Fake it till you make it' is a pretty good credo to live by right now. After all, you've planned several changes, and you're too careful to have made any real blunders. So relax. Be confident that things will go through as scheduled.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You won't give up even when you should be erring on the side of caution. Is this really the best time or place to make your last stand? Are style and attitude more important than substance and knowledge? Reality may teach a hard lesson if you're not careful. Cut your losses sooner instead of later.

Go where it's safe and gradually let off steam instead of exploding all at once. It's the best way to deal with perfectly valid feelings. Because patience is more than a virtue.
