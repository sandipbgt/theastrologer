        "horoscope": "You're charging ahead with some plan or venture, and you're feeling strong. But you should slow down for a moment and take a closer look. It seems that others are cooperating, but it's likely that they're doing so grudgingly at best. And though this may feel like a blow to you, you should hear them out. You're better off working out the kinks now instead of waiting till later, when the whole situation is more complicated.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Life can seem so confusing sometimes. You're sensitive by nature, and you pick up on other people's feelings and needs. Trying to balance those with your own can be a real feat, but right now, you're enjoying a day of inner calm. Instead of worrying whether you're doing the right thing, you know that you are -- and that sets you on a straight and narrow path. Doesn't making a decision feel better?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You know your sharp temper can be an issue when you're under stress, and forewarned, as they say, is forearmed. Avoid conflict with others. Otherwise, your current sense of tension may prod you into anger mode today. In the moment, of course, you'll be full of good excuses for why you said what you did, but later, you'll have to explain yourself -- and apologize.

Better yet, draw up a budget, or revise the one you already have, and make sure everything is as balanced as possible. It's time to start building up your nest egg.

Sometimes staying home is the best thing you can do for your health, both mental and physical. This is the perfect time for you to spend some quality time reconnecting with yourself.

Let other people realize the truth on their own time. It'll happen, you'll see. Things will change for the better, but only if you take a step back and let them. If you try to micromanage everything, on the other hand, things will keep going along as they've been: one step forward, and two steps back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You need and deserve this calm, peaceful day. Let everyone else think and do whatever they please. You'll be comfortable at home, tending to life at a basic level: eating, resting, regrouping and connecting with the people you love most.

Everyone will get their turn very soon, so you aren't worried about missing out on anything. What a relaxed and relaxing place to be.

But this sudden urge to possess more stuff denotes more than just temporary materialism. It means you're feeling a bit insecure, and you're trying to fill that void with possessions, to make yourself feel safe. Remember, sentiment matters more than market value.
