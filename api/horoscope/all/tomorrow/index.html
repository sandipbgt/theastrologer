You know you don't have to charge out and force yourself onto other people in order to make a difference. You'll make great things happen just by listening to their concerns. Extend yourself in this way today. Lend an ear to people in need. It's a real gift for them, but it also gives you input for correcting your course or redefining your goal. Soon you can start a new project or continue an existing one with a greater understanding of the stakes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It sounds like spectacular fun from the sidelines, but that doesn't always mean you want to be in the middle of it. Therefore, you should be extremely careful about who you touch today. It'll help to know something about chemistry, because certain elements remain highly unstable no matter how cool and composed they look.

Even if it never happened before, there's always a first time. Just assume that now is the moment to manifest your best possible reality.

Share your life experiences and break out the maps that will help them find a better road out of wherever they are. It's finally time to bring all those natural talents of yours  into play.

The ideas just keep coming and coming. Although anything could happen from this point, including failure, you should remain optimistic. Put in the energy that will match the outcome you want.

It's OK to bend with the prevailing wind, even if it goes against your training. Discovery will blow through your life when you least expect it. You can't even imagine what will happen then, nor should you try. Keep your mind open and your datebook empty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
