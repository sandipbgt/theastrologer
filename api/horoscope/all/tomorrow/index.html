Explore a new neighborhood, or better yet, a new town. If you can't do that, explore the world virtually through reading or watching films. And above all, let your mind wander. Entertain new ideas. Develop new theories. Make mental connections between seemingly unrelated elements.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
