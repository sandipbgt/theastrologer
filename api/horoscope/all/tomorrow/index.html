        "horoscope": "Creativity and quick wits merge, heightening your imagination and drawing out your artistic side today. The good news is, you're not some snooty artist. Instead, you're open and talkative about your methods, happy to answer anyone's questions in an open and friendly way. Others' curiosity matches your own, so you understand where they're coming from. And if you open up a discussion about creative projects, you could actually learn a thing or two from someone else with different experience. A new opportunity presents itself, merging your fields of mutual interest. It's getting good now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Flirt and promise, but leave yourself enough wiggle room to keep any new commitments from hardening into a prison. Your appeal is legendary, which should explain why they're lining up to see you.

It all depends on how much you like the person on the receiving end, because you could be giving them grief, bad information or computer viruses. But you know what?

You need a vacation from all this, bigtime. Approach that simple decision as a way out.

Finger pointing will only call attention to your own hands, which might not be as clean as you'd like to believe. Stop making a fuss and start making yourself useful. Change the system from within.
