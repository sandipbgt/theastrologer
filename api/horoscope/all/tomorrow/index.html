After all, you're a people pleaser, and it's hard to please everyone when people have conflicting ideas or views. Sometimes it's easier just to smile, nod and let everyone else work it out. But perhaps you can find a way to be honest without stirring the pot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

This could lead to an enjoyably intense encounter with someone, but it could also lead to a difficult one, if you aren't careful to temper your feelings and reactions. Raw emotion can be enlightening -- transformative, even -- but it can also be difficult and hurtful.
