You're selfless right now; you have such a feeling of devotion that you'd do anything for the people you love. Grand gestures aren't enough! And yet, you don't have to do anything showy to prove your feelings. Just being there for someone is more than enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're a visionary, and the current cosmic influence only increases your tendency to dream big. That's a wonderful quality, except now it could lead to disappointment if things don't fall into place as you'd expected. Perhaps a better caution is to be as realistic as possible, even as you let your imagination roam.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
