But it's also important to remember that yours isn't the only valid point of view in the room. If you're working on your own today, you'll get a lot done, because no one is standing in your way. But if you have to cooperate with others, try to be flexible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's a good day to be generous with others, and show them how much you appreciate them. Treat a friend to dinner or give someone an unexpected gift.

Stop and consider what's making you feel insecure. A conversation with a good friend might help a lot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
