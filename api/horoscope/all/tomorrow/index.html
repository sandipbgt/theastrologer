It may seem as if everyone is being overly dramatic, but you're having some insecure feelings, yourself, and they're making you act in uncharacteristic ways. Maybe if you focus on the root of the issue -- what's worrying you -- you'll feel more in control of things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
