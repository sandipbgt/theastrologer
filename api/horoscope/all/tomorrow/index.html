The dominoes are aligned just so, and you took special care as you set them up, with your usual attention to detail. One little push is all it'll take to set things into gorgeous, stunning motion. Then, you'll step back and marvel as things seem to fall into place of their own accord. Don't forget to take a little credit -- you made it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You'll find your notes are important for your future, even if they seem a little mundane at first glance. Just remember that sometimes the simplest, most obvious idea actually is the best one. And if you work through your thoughts with your friends or coworkers, they may be able to help you brainstorm something truly inspired.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your warmth and acceptance make your friends feel great, and they want to return the favor. Why not let them? Whether you're looking for their support or not, you've got it. Think about what you want to get done, and make a mental list of the people you want with you as you make it happen.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You know that results are a lot more satisfying than any theory could ever be, and that's especially true right now. Plus, you're in the mood to physically enjoy yourself. So turn that practical eye toward something solid, basic, and creative, like a new investment strategy or connecting with your sweetheart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But today, you'll have an extra-sensory edge that lets you understand all kinds of things you weren't aware of even a day ago. Be sure to use this heightened sensitivity. You could help friends or coworkers hash out an issue they're having, or zero in on someone nearby in need of your help. Whatever happens now, no one can hold you back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "Before you start tossing around orders and harsh judgments, stop and consider -- who made you boss? People might soon find this attitude pretty tiresome. If you can't take a kinder point of view, today is going to be full of conflict. Turn that critical eye away from other people and toward yourself -- you know there's room for improvement. Focus on being a kinder, gentler person, and get some exercise to help burn off some of that steam.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you're heading up a team or getting a project or relationship off the ground, it's time for an adjustment in your approach. The truth is, you may need to work harder to fit in. This doesn't have to break your spirit -- if anyone can turn it into a fun life lesson, you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

This irritation may be real, but it's just as likely that it's all in your head. Either way, it's your job to manage it gracefully, because you can't just bite everyone's head off. Your focus now should be on kindness and cooperation. If you can fly solo today, even better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If anyone knows how to blend without clashing, it's you. That's true in your artistic projects as well as your relationships with friends and work mates. You're especially graceful now, because you're feeling so centered. This is a great time to surround yourself with comfort and beauty, and take pleasure in watching it spread to others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You may even notice that no one seems to be enforcing any restrictions, but that doesn't mean you should take this thing and run with it. Behave for now. Above all, remember that any deals you make have to be straightforward, aboveboard, and squeaky clean.

But it's all too easy for you to get stuck in a relationship or situation that doesn't serve you, simply because it's easy and you're used to it. Try not to depend so much on set patterns. Instead, start thinking now about how to liberate yourself. Claiming your freedom won't be scary. In fact, it should feel strangely good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's important for you to recognize the vibes you're putting out, because they affect the people around you, especially those you're closest to -- including your friends, your sweetie, or your business partner. Furthermore, if you aren't careful, your unconscious desires could take over and you'll end up attracting someone you'll later wish you'd left alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
