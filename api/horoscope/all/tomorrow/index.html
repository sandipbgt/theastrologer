Remember, insolent remarks can only make a strained situation worse. This may feel like a stretch, but try making peace instead of war. Creating tension is no fun for anyone, and it's bad for your health. If you can't seem to get along with others today,, you might be better off spending time on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Sometimes, it's good to go ahead and let it all hang out, but today this could drive your allies away. You need their support and assistance too much.
