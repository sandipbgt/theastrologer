        "horoscope": "Your friends and coworkers seem a little aloof today. You might prefer a warmer, more sociable atmosphere, but you're preoccupied with your own responsibilities, too. The current energy is just right for getting a lot accomplished, no matter how tedious or complicated the job might be. A methodical approach works best. It allows you to see any places where the process breaks down, so you can rework or revise, and move on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Your perspective is almost entirely logical today. You trust your own and others' perceptions only if they're grounded in fact. This works well in plenty of situations -- attending to mundane business, for example, or constructing a professional or academic project. But when it comes to dealing with people and emotions, a different approach may be needed. Don't forget that rationality doesn't apply to feelings. Be open on more than the mental level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You can move forward with confidence, because you know your projections are well founded. Anyone who might be observing your progress is sure to be impressed, but you aren't in this for the glory.
