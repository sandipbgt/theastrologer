Exercise your will when appropriate, but be cautious. Your employer or creditors might be measuring your abilities. Since fine motor skills really count now, you may have to work against your own instincts and plan ahead. It's a good thing you're naturally wily and ingenious. If anyone can make this challenge work to their advantage, you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Well, you belong to the people in your community, too. And if you feel good physically and emotionally, today would be a fine time for reaching out. But don't engage everyone with a challenge, because not everyone thinks friendly conflict is fun. Find ways to agree with them. Show more affection so they'll know this is more than a mental exercise. The world deserves you, and you deserve to fit in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
