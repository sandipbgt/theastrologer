        "horoscope": "Your emotional weather report calls for some turbulence today. Abandonment issues are triggered by some minor slight. Maybe another person's take on an old event will betray your carefully selected memories of it. Clumsy efforts might interfere with smooth transitions. You'll probably worry about everything, because that's how you get sometimes, and anxiety might start to unravel the basic fabric of your security. Uh-oh. Try to minimize the damage sooner, not later. If you wait too long, there's no telling what else could get tangled up in all this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Times are friendlier than you think. Generosity might not have an ulterior motive beyond somebody thinking, 'Hey, let's be friendly and build us a community.' Accept what's freely offered today, and accept it graciously. Why be such a tyrant about these things, turning privileges into so-called rights? Maybe this fine opportunity will be repeated if you don't nip it in the bud. There's nothing weak about showing your sunny side. In fact, it's an indicator of strength when you know enough to power down from combat mode. Be a good citizen and make yourself useful.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You're breezy but grounded, spinning like a windmill in no danger of getting dizzy and falling over. You're sensitive without being fragile. You're feeling those emotional tides without letting them shatter or erode you. You're a brave hero with a wicked sense of humor, and it's all because you know who you are. Be proud of where you've been. Be optimistic about where you're going. You could accomplish today if that's what needs to happen. And with all these vivid metaphors about yourself, you're like a walking work of art. People might pay just to see you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Look at the nature of these deliveries, though. Don't just go dumping onto other people's heads. Be sensitive to their needs today. Once you get the picture, start using all those royal gifts to invent solutions and organize your program around what's good for them. That make a lot more sense than  sticking with what's easy for you. They'll love you for it, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Whoa! Listen to yourself. That's your voice demanding things you don't really want. What's up with that, anyway? Are you going with a preselected program? Are you trying to prove your loyalty? Groupthink could sway you a little too easily today. It's good that you're speaking up, but use the opportunity to request what works for you personally. Maybe you'll raise a few eyebrows, fracture the party line or push someone else out of the way. It can't be helped, at least not if you're being true to who you really are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But your adoring public would get a better look at who you really are if you'd just stand still. You can't say if you're coming or going today, and that means no one else will know if you're here or there, either. Kind of makes it hard to get a date or find work, doesn't it? Burning the candle at both ends can't be good for you. Slow down and breathe.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Sure, you're feeling energetic and inspired, but the best way to use this brief period is for a little quiet time. Do stay alert, of course. Something might come up that needs your attention. But mostly, try to appreciate subtlety. Tune in to life's quieter rhythms, and pay attention to your own body and comfort. That way your strength will be rejuvenated when it's time to snap back to attention.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But don't let being laid back hold you back. Don't stand aside holding the door for others when you should be the first one through. You wouldn't be giving yourself a fair shake. Find your forward-thinking energy and ride it today. Work casual miracles with whatever falls into your hands.

They'll point out that you're too sure about the wrong things. Maybe you're suddenly temperamental when you used to be cool with everything. Perhaps you're slamming doors that most people expect to opened and close gently. Clearly there's attitude happening, and you're not taking them along for this ride. OK, have they defined the problem yet? Only you can tell them why it's happening.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Really, it is. Just be honest about your expectations and your methods. Of course, there's honesty, and then there's selective honesty. With a positive spin, this could turn out well for everyone today. They hear what sounds good to them, you get what you want, and you're all happy.

Ordinarily you might feel stifled, but now you just feel safely sheltered. It's comforting sometimes to take a breather, isn't it? And today represents the alone time you've really been needing. So use it well. Concentrate on something you've had on your plate for a while, such as getting your finances in order. This is the perfect time to do what needs to be done in order to clear the decks for something brand new. It's coming soon!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Of course you're confident. Confidence is your middle name. Throw yourself into the game with this newfound courage, because it will take that kind of commitment for you to see your strength and individuality with new eyes. There's only one of you and you're only as young as you let yourself be. But be mature enough to know where you are and what you're supposed to be doing. Find that need and fill it today, while you still have reason to be excited. Hang onto this feeling and make it work for you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
