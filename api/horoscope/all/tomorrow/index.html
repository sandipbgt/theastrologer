It's great that you're filled once again with your usual can-do attitude, but try to be realistic about how much you can actually accomplish. And go easy on your caffeine intake! The truth is, you don't need the extra stimulation. You've got enough get-up-and-go as it is.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If so, just find a quiet moment in which to take a few deep breaths. With some effort, you can channel this high energy into your work or any other effort you're pursuing right now. It's a great day to accomplish something, but try not to wear yourself out in the process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Anyone who gets in your way today could feel the brunt of your mood, unless you take special care to rein in your angry feelings. And what are you so upset about, anyway?
