        "horoscope": "Don't get caught up in superficial things today. The deeper issues deserve your full attention -- tackle them with messy gusto. At work, throw yourself into a project by asking your work-mates for brainstorming help. Ideas run fast and rampant now, so write them all down, because it's easy to feel confused or indecisive. If a relationship is stressing you, don't underestimate clear communication. Stick to your truest, deepest feelings rather than dwelling on the surface of your insecurities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Cooperating with friends now will bring great results, whether your project is a pickup softball game or a fledgling business venture. Throwing all your passion into a joint venture is almost certain to bring great results, so don't hold back. Be the-starter that you are -- tell the others your ideas and rally them into action.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You get caught up in trying to help everyone all the time, and you end up allowing yourself to be taken advantage of. No more -- now you're trying to claim your rightful position of power. The thing is, maybe you don't have to fight quite so hard for the respect you deserve -- because maybe, just maybe, they're already giving it to you.

Flirting with someone cute or trading friendly barbs with a pal or coworker might seem like harmless fun, and it is as it doesn't break your focus. Whatever you're working on still demands your attention. Remember that any thoughtless moves today could lead to harsh consequences tomorrow, so stay responsible.

Get out of the house, or even out of town -- this kind of lusty energy begs for a new perspective.
