Being narrow-minded will only impede your navigation. So open up. Otherwise, you'll start feeling the effects on your health and happiness. If you haven't been smiling much lately, or you're feeling tired and lethargic, you'll know it's time to loosen up about some issue in your life. Accept it as it is, not as you want it to be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

People need to know where you stand. They might have no idea how you really feel, so putting your emotions, needs and expectations into words is important.

Your instincts are humming, so they shouldn't steer you wrong. And everyone is noticing your sweet, even-keeled nature. People are probably lining up to help you, or just to hang out with you; everyone wants a little bit of you to rub off on them. And why wouldn't they?

That gives you some leeway to conserve your resources for something else. In fact, today can be as fulfilling as you want it to be, because your own energy is strong and centered, and you're surrounded by plenty of people who admire you.

Maybe that's why other people don't move when you push. They don't understand what you're trying to accomplish, or why you're not allowing them to get more directly involved.

Or maybe you're just connecting at a more emotional level than you normally do -- or even softening up a bit. If so, that's a good thing. You could use a break from lighthearted, witty behavior. Sometimes, a bit of good, old-fashioned sincerity is just the thing. You'll find this is an effective approach in business dealings, too.

Hmm, maybe that's not the best way to operate, even if you are in a foul mood. Instead of hurting people's feelings or burning bridges, back off before somebody else gets hurt.
