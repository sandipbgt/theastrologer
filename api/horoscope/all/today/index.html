        "horoscope": "Today, your emotional life is an interesting mixture of sensitive and strong. You're feeling sentimental, and harsh words or hard situations could hurt your feelings. But that very tenderness is what makes you so compassionate, and compassion makes you powerful. You can be a true nurturing force now, and really make a difference in someone's life -- a friend's or a stranger's. Tap into that feeling, giving side of yourself today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You want to help them, especially if you sense that they're feeling worried or upset. Be as nurturing as possible without taking on someone else's negativity. Sometimes you're like a sponge for others' feelings,-- good and bad!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
