Conversation is stimulating and laughter flows easily now. It's a great day for a little romance, too! Spending time with a friend or someone special just feels right. It promotes a sense of togetherness, an awareness that we're all in this together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Either way, conversations flow like a fast-moving river, and laughter soon follows. Your own words and thoughts are articulate and well-formed. It's easy to slip into a kind of performance mode as you command a rapt audience. Enjoy this brief, invigorating influence! It's a lot of fun to be so intellectually attuned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That could be tough for you to do, especially if your feelings are hurt. But being able to focus on what's most important -- working harmoniously together -- shows an impressive level of maturity. And you'd much rather work together than have to strike out on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You naturally take other people's feelings into account, and you always help out when you can. That's the perfect attitude for the current lunar energy. Cooperative action takes you where you want to go. And there are side benefits to being helpful, too. For one thing, people are more likely to support you when you need it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You prefer to be the leader, but sometimes it's better to demonstrate that you're one of the team. You might have to 'fake it till you make it.' But you can do it! Smile, nod and cooperate. This reduces tension for everyone, and makes them more open to following your lead in the future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

When you're in mixed company, it's best to avoid touchy subjects such as politics or spirituality. No one wants to sense tension in the group! Spend time with close friends now.

If you're stuck solo at home or the office, a lonely mood could settle in. In that case, dispel the gloom by calling a friend or IM-ing a coworker.
