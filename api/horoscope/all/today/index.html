It's like a voice on your shoulder, taunting you and egging you on, saying, 'Go on -- do it!' Daredevil schemes suddenly seem like a great idea. And you know what? Your sheer willingness to take a risk could carry you through just about any tight spot. So be wise, but also, be bold!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

When you're feeling like this -- full of spunk -- it's important to be aware of other people. In certain company, being aggressive is fun and perfectly appropriate. In other settings, it's smart to stay polite, even as you make your move and flatten the competition.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
