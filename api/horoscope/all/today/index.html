They can't call you lazy today, assuming they can even see what you're doing. Clearly you've mastered the process, although it's not always going to be about who travels farthest or finishes first. Imagine what it would be like to do what's never been done before. Of course, that'll mean slowing down on your victory lap so they can get a good look at you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Yes, a little bit of greed might be OK if it brings you closer to some worthwhile goal, but don't lose hold of your artistic side as those ambitions flare.
