Your natural restlessness is on high, too, and it's easy to behave impulsively. This could get you into minor trouble, such as interrupting people during conversations, or saying things you don't mean. You might have to apologize for overstepping your bounds. Try to think before you speak or act today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Focus instead on gathering information. You can organize it later, when you're thinking more clearly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
