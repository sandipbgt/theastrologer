All your options -- turkey on rye or a spinach wrap? writing a novel or climbing the corporate ladder? -- seem equally appealing. On days like this, you're better off not trying to make a decision. Just keep gathering information -- and try to have fun.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
