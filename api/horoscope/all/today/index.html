Steep yourself in the past today, but only for a few moments. Your focus should be forward, toward your bright future. Today could be the start of an important, month-long project, if you turn your attention ahead of you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Reach out to the people and pets in your immediate sphere of influence -- your family and close friends -- and turn your nurturing energy toward them.

Of course, work makes you feel secure in a different way, and that's important now, too.

It's okay if you want to stay home and keep your own counsel, but do record your feelings in your blog or journal.

Aim some kicks at the heavy bag at the gym. Do some pushups.
