Many people are in their own heads today, chasing down an idea or pursuing a cause they find personally meaningful. You might be preoccupied with an interesting topic or issue, yourself. So let everyone off the hook. It's time to think and make plans. Soon, you'll feel warmly social again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're certainly alert and engaged with the world around you. It's a great day for making plans or taking action on a meaningful project. But that's the key now: Your work has to mean something to you. If you don't find it important, you won't feel that sense of captivation and urgency.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
