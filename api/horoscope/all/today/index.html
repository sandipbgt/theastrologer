        "horoscope": "Assert yourself, by all means, but don't ruin everything by doing so. Push your agenda constructively. Only crash the parties where you know you'll be welcome. Today will be great if you know enough to hold off when people don't need you. Even the perfect energy at the wrong time could mess things up. While you're absolutely entitled to strut through your world free and unafraid, you also have a duty to be appropriate. Why not start the next month off on the right foot? When people like your attitude and style, they'll be more willing to support you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Honing your strength and perfecting your technique will build your confidence. Soon you'll be back in the thick of things. Then you can impress everyone -- your friends, your boss, your clients -- with the fruits of all that work and inspiration. Today, take it easy. Instead of starting a new project, tie up loose ends on an existing one. This is the perfect time for dedicated detail work. You'll love the results.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's just your perspective, however, and not a reflection of anyone's reality but your own. Don't threaten your friends and family with your worries. Instead, let them brighten your day with their sunshine. This gift will get you through this brief yet potentially intense period of discomfort. You can also channel your nervous anxiety into something constructive, even if it's just deep-cleaning the house.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You're operating under some tricky energy, and you could convince yourself you deserve more power and control than you really do. Those closest to you will think you've got a lot of nerve if you show attitude for no good reason. Don't let that kind of bad behavior bring you down. Instead, find a positive use for this energy. Help someone else, or channel it into your work. Soon you'll calm down and come to your senses.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your fingerprints are all over the situation, but don't worry about spilling the evidence or spreading your germs, because everybody wants this kind of contagious enthusiasm. Keep them laughing (as if you had a choice about that). It's all totally hilarious, but you've never been more serious. One way or another, you'll get your point across. Hold that thought, and you'll hold onto this glorious feeling, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You aren't used to operating under such revved-up energy, are you? You're ordinarily so peaceable that you don't quite know what to do with yourself today. Of course, chasing down bold schemes is kind of fun, and even the restless harmony that fills your soul feels interesting. This is a great time to get things done -- big things, like pet projects you've been wanting to get off the ground for some time. Just make sure you exercise a bit of self-discipline. Mastering your impulses might be annoying, but it could mean the difference between success and failure.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Yes, everything that happens to you can be useful, too. Today's optimism will put you on top of the world, or at least so far up the food chain that none of the bottom feeders will stand a chance. Because, life without bottom feeders -- does it get any better? This is the best thing that could happen to you. And it all starts with your attitude.

Things like this have happened to you before, and you can still look back and laugh. So the world has thrown you yet another opportunity. Recognize and realize your potential ASAP.

Today you'll probably switch back and forth between missions to avoid confrontation, get a better deal, or go with the hottest prospect. It's illogical in some ways and sane in others. Petty, material or animal concerns are hard to overcome. Maybe you should set your high ideals aside for now and come back to them when you're more focused.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

When every choice looks like a crisis, you know you've backed yourself into a corner. Old concerns seem foolish now, yet still you long for the good old days when those things were such a big deal. Forget all that for now, because the only way out is up. Rise above your circumstances. Think less about yourself for a while. All it takes is a little distance, and you'll be able to relax again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Still, be considerate of others' feelings and ideas, especially those who come from different backgrounds than your own. Most of us speak vastly different languages, you know, even if the words coming out of our mouths are the same. And you're all stuck together today. You may as well get along, and you're just the person to lead the effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
