Your audacity is a force in itself; it's that dash of daring that helps you slide through rough spots and come out squeaky-clean. Other people watch you in action and only wish they could be so bold! Instead of using this up on silly feats of fearlessness that are ultimately pointless, apply it consciously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If so, no worries -- your thoughts are quick, and it's much easier than usual to make speedy connections. You'll probably surprise yourself with the things that come out of your mouth! Of course, unrehearsed statements can have a downside, but you're a caring person. If you say something that comes out wrong, make quick amends.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
