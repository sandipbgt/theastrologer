That may include practical activities such as cooking or going to the office. But you could also work through a problem with a loved one. Whatever you do today, do it from the heart.

        "horoscope": "Be careful of other people's sensitive spots today. You're honest and straightforward, and that's definitely part of your charm. But on days like today, when many people are feeling moody and vulnerable, it's best to tread lightly. Avoid pushing buttons or criticizing others. If you have to give feedback or correct someone's thinking or behavior, do so as constructively as possible. It usually helps to lead with a compliment!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

The truth is, a cranky day doesn't threaten the harmony of your connection nearly so much as making a big deal about it!

Avoiding a phone call or letter from someone you used to know will only put off a conversation you'll eventually have to have. And ignoring old memories won't work either.
