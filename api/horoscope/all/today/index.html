You could come across as a little bit desperate, and you wouldn't want that. Besides, you can find other ways to show them your passion. Try methods that cost nothing, such as conversation. Talk about your feelings and your interests, and ask other people about theirs. Get a dialogue going.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You might even claim you don't care what other people think, but deep down, you care a lot about how your friends and loved ones see you. It's time to get this in balance. If someone criticizes you today, don't run and hide, or take it personally. Consider whether there's a bit of truth in what they say, and use it as constructive advice.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The fact that this exists within you both fascinates and frightens you. But the sooner you start using it, the sooner you'll become the person you're meant to be -- the person you are on the inside.

Everyone's already looking to you for direction, and you're the only one able to project your voice above the din.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
