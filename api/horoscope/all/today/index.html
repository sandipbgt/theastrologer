Don't say anything that's not absolutely necessary, which includes most of your current opinions -- your view of the world is a little screwy at the moment. Your energy is off, and it's better for everyone if you just sit back and take it easy. Of course, withdrawing completely won't do, either. Find a happy medium between 'lone wolf' and 'in your face aggression.' Spend time with people you love and trust.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If not, be more approachable today. Make sure you're not working at cross-purposes with somebody who wants what's best for you. Even when your intentions are golden, one little slip could look really bad. Do your best, and if you screw up, at least you can say you tried. You'll have other chances to be perfect, especially if you find someone more sympathetic to your flaws.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
