        "horoscope": "Communication could be frustrating today. If you try to get a real dialogue going with your sweetheart, best friend, or business partner, your good intentions could fly out the window as things degenerate into petty bickering. If this happens, retreat and give it a rest for a while. You've never been good at backing away from intensity, but it might be essential now. Wait until everyone is feeling a little more levelheaded, and try again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're feeling pressured by work, health issues, and other weighty problems, but that's no excuse to drop out of your daily duties -- or your usual pleasures. You should still reach out to your loved ones, and don't shortchange your own health. If you have to get up an hour earlier to work out, so be it. Eating healthy and getting plenty of rest will also help ease you through this period.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Maybe it's just that you're so stylish and ingenious, and your gifts have finally caught on. Today, make use of your new buzz -- rub elbows with higher-ups, ask out someone special, or take a project to the next level. It's almost sinfully easy now to create your own success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Here's a quick fix -- be less tentative and more decisive. The only tough part about this is you're a thinker by nature. It's hard for you to turn off that brain of yours. So use that to your advantage -- think your way into calm functionality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

On the outside, yeah, maybe you're going along with others because it's easier than taking a firm stance of your own. But inside, you're developing vision and strength, which could burst out of you any day now. Remember, though, that if people are used to you not having a backbone, it may take them some time to get used to the newer, stronger you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Don't try to even up old scores. Instead, start with a fresh, clean slate and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
