But doing so could be difficult, because you're feeling vulnerable and insecure. If you're among trusted friends, your fears are unfounded. But if you're involved with someone new, maybe you're right to hold back a bit, until you know what's going on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
