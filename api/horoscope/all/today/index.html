Rapid comprehension and mad networking skills make you a major player in the world of here-and-now. Let this moment last another day. As if you needed an invitation to do that, because what sane person would want something like this to end? It's a lot of fun being the most popular kid on the block.

But hold back and do the prudent, neighborly thing today instead. You'll actually enjoy the downtime if you just give it a chance. By purposely slowing down and getting along with people, you'll score big points for later. Open your ears, while you're at it. Someone's great idea could give you a whole new approach, which you can put to use soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Maybe you're not trying to impress anyone with your superior motor skills or eye-hand coordination, but you could be mistaken for a dancer or athlete. What matters most, though, are your expectations. Don't aim too high and set yourself up for failure. If you're going into this alone, be reasonable about what you can accomplish in the coming month.

You're a dedicated friend, but you won't let that interfere too much with your plans. The fact is, friendship aside, you also have to be quick on your feet if you want a bigger slice of the pie. Of course you'll be a good provider to anyone who believes that you'll be coming back. Share what you come up with today.

You could precipitate a crisis today if you don't pause for breath and see where things actually stand. In the best-case scenario, you already did what you could, and now it's up to the forces you set in motion.

Later, you could find yourself a little closer to perfect, and all the effort and uneasy feelings will seem worth it. Of course, don't discount luck. That plays a part, too.

Soon, you'll find yourself making alliances with people you never thought you'd connect with on any level, much less this deeply.
