        "sunsign": "Aries",
        "horoscope": "Make an effort to speak calmly today, especially in conversations about touchy subjects. Your energy is especially high, and you're feeling worked up and suspicious of other people's motives. It's easy to read into things they say and do, but don't assume you're seeing them clearly. On days like this, it's always best to err on the side of kindness, forgiveness and turning the other cheek, even if the warrior within you wants to charge!"

    {
        "sunsign": "Taurus",
        "horoscope": "Your stubborn streak swells today. Make a conscious effort to stay calm and open-minded, because the tendency is strong now to project all kinds of feelings and intentions onto other people -- and many times, these projections will be negative in tone. Guard against this, Taurus. Don't assume anything at work or at home. If a suspicious feeling sneaks into your consciousness, don't act on it! Ask the other person for clarification."

    {
        "sunsign": "Gemini",
        "horoscope": "It's an intense day for everyone, and emotions are flying around you like Ping-Pong balls. You might feel like the eye of the storm -- the lone sane person in a room full of crazies. In moments like this, it's important to draw on your famous sense of humor. Find the joke in any emotional scene you happen to witness or stumble into. See if you can get other people laughing, as well."

    {
        "sunsign": "Cancer",
        "horoscope": "You're feeling things deeply today, both sweet emotions and difficult ones. The best use of today's intense energy is for connecting with the people you love best -- those friends and family members whom you trust implicitly and love from the bottom of your heart. Lean on these people today, Cancer. And try not to attach any importance to other people's emotional outbursts. You're sensitive by nature, but you don't have to absorb their negativity."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Leo",
        "horoscope": "Get ready for some passionate displays and acts of will today. Your emotions are roiling inside you like water set to a boil, and you aren't being very discriminating in how you express them or when. The truth is, you may not even know why you're feeling these ways -- stubborn, angry, vulnerable, jealous, upset. At least you're feeling your emotions fully, which helps soothe them more quickly. Still, try not to unleash them on unsuspecting victims."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Virgo",
        "horoscope": "Things feel a little off today, and you could slip into critical mode if you don't stay self-aware. Nothing seems up to par at the moment -- and that includes you and your own performance. Try not to judge yourself and others so harshly. Irrational worries are welling up within you, and you're responding with perfectionism. Be gentle with yourself. Accept your feelings, Virgo, even if you don't understand them."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Libra",
        "horoscope": "Life is suddenly intense for everyone around you, and emotions are flying. You could feel a little off-kilter, but try to maintain your sense of balance, even when you're swamped with feeling. You have a deep desire for connection with another person now. Or, you could find yourself absorbed in creating a piece of artwork that expresses some meaningful aspect of your own soul. It's up to you."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Scorpio",
        "horoscope": "The world looks fresh now. Take a moment today to feel the energy and passion simmering just below your surface -- and remember that you can use these forces in many different ways. Obviously, manipulative behavior isn't a good expression of your strength; neither is an outburst of anger toward an unsuspecting person. Your actions today set the course for the next month of your life, so move forward with care and purpose."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Sagittarius",
        "horoscope": "Normally you're drawn to big-picture thinking and taking a broader view, but today you're inclined to delve deeply into some issue or relationship. This is a great time to enjoy some unexpected passion with your partner, or to lose yourself in studying a subject that interests you. With just a little effort, you can discover incredible secrets you never suspected about yourself, your lover or your chosen course of study."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Capricorn",
        "horoscope": "Dig into your work today. You're intensely focused, and no detail slips past you. Of course, you always do a thorough job, no matter what project lies on your plate, but today you can really delve deeply into something. Losing yourself in your work can be a freeing experience. And it's certainly a good distraction from any moodiness you're feeling or emotional issues you may be facing in your personal life."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Aquarius",
        "horoscope": "The world seems to have gone crazy today, and in a tough moment you might think you're surrounded by drama queens. If so, try to remember that, although you're uncomfortable with intense emotional displays, they aren't always a bad thing. Maybe one of your loved ones needs to get something off their chest. Or maybe you've been repressing something deep and dark, yourself. If so, talk about it. Don't keep it bottled up."
    },
    {
        "sunsign": "Pisces",
        "horoscope": "Your usual compassion and sensitivity deepen today into a sense of intimate connection with your loved ones. Even if you're far away from someone who's dear to you, you can feel their presence as if they're next to you. This is a wonderful time to reach out to someone you care about. Your devotion runs strong and true; you're passionately invested in others' feelings and needs. You can serve someone now with selfless dedication."
