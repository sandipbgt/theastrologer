But today, they could become your thing whether you like it or not! If you're feeling strongly about someone you love, open up and make your feelings known. If someone else is the one with strong feelings, you might want to brace yourself for a storm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

If someone's behavior is absolutely ridiculous, it's a pretty good indication they're feeling sensitive and upset. Fortunately, you're wise enough to resist engaging with someone who's just spoiling for a fight. You're also wise enough to recognize a genuine need for compassion.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Alternatively, it may be someone else in your life who wants to get close, which could come off a little clingy to you! Either way, try not to overreact.
