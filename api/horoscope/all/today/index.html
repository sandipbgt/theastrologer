You're full of energy, and you want to work closely with other people toward a common goal. Whoever you share that goal with, don't forget that in the long term, it's important to be consistent. Today isn't about scattering your efforts in severalat once -- it's about focusing your energy toward a positive end.

Okay, so you'd rather not ripple your reflective pool today -- that's understandable. But life isn't always about self-indulgence, much as you might beg to differ. If you don't rouse yourself to action when necessary, you could end up feeling very uneasy -- the exact opposite of healthy and relaxed. So get ready to get moving.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Conversations with friends or coworkers could get a little tricky as you work out the kinks of the problem or project. If that happens, don't worry.

Maybe your version of personal growth means live and let live. There will be changes today, but will you be the one to make them?

Yes, these are all powerful motivators, but don't do anything too dramatic for them. Dignity matters more than you realize. Stand up and walk away from any situation that would bring you this low.

But keep your eyes on the prize, too. There's a kind of unspoken beauty in going for what you want.
