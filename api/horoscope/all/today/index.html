Even a conservative approach is better than some high-flying idea that may or may not work out. The emphasis right now is on practicality and efficiency, so just for today, minimize the risks you take.

Hard work is important, and it's rewarding if you love what you do. But if you're only pursuing a goal in hopes of impressing others, you may end up wearing yourself out -- and you still won't feel satisfied. In the end, your self-respect is the only thing that counts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
