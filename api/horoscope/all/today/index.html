Your energy is still higher than usual today, but if you're feeling a bit ragged around the edges, try something to soothe your nerves. Sip hot tea or cocoa. Clean your house and organize your closet or office. Or go to the gym, or do some yoga on the living room floor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
