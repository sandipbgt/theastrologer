But right now, running along with the pack doesn't feel right, either. You may have to resign yourself to feeling a little isolated as you take a stand on some issue that's important to you, or pursue a project that's close to your heart.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

And mental stimulation is a must right now. Working your way through an interesting puzzle feels as good as a hard workout.

Maybe you're afraid of giving all your secrets away. And if others won't follow your lead, you're perfectly willing to go it alone. Except team efforts are favored now.

Maybe you're afraid your child's or friend's independence will pull them away from you. That's an understandable fear, but an unfounded one. Everyone is an individual, after all.

Using your mind in complicated and interesting ways is the best kind of mental workout. You love challenging yourself in this way. If you're stuck for ideas, brainstorm with friends or coworkers.

They're probably just wrapped up in their own pursuits. That's the kind of energy that's swirling around today.
