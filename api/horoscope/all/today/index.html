It's soothing to be reminded of your roots -- where you come from, and who's been by your side the longest.

The important thing now is to be authentic, and not to avoid your true feelings. Call a dear, trusted friend if there's something you think you can't face alone. Talking it out will certainly help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
