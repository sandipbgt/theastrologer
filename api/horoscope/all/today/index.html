But if you're working on a project that involves creativity, it could go very well. You're in a highly imaginative frame of mind. Otherwise, allow your mind to wander. It's a good day for napping, reading or listening to music. All of these will feed your creative muse.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You want to get along with others in gentle harmony, so you'll defer to your coworker's approach to a project or your spouse's choice of movie or restaurant. The truth is, you don't mind what you do now, as long as you can enjoy being together.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's all too easy now to give up too much. You may not even know what you want. Your own needs are tangled up with your awareness of the other person's feelings. How can you honor both equally? That's your challenge for today. Be forewarned that it may be difficult, but aim towards it anyway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You actually gain strength from being so in touch with your feelings, and with others' emotions as well. It's easy to read people now, because you're connecting at the heart level instead of just with your mind.
