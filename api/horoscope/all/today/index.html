So why are they always getting in your face, going behind your back, or just making your life difficult through their very existence? Have more sympathy for the people who irritate you. They have their reasons for behaving that way. Or maybe they're just being themselves and you need to look at your own buttons. Whoever's at fault, though, give everyone the day to make their case.

Today, you're in touch with an inner sense of peace and love, and you're willing to put hard effort into the most important projects on your agenda. Keeping all those balls in theshouldn't be difficult, because you're powered by a genuine sense of caring. Focus on one or two short-term goals you'd like to achieve, and at least one long-term aim. That enables you to take deliberate steps toward accomplishing great things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Try hard not to make an issue of yourself or draw others' disapproval, especially at work. Instead, focus on ways you can be part of the solution. Soothe and distract yourself with information gathering or another task you're good at and can enjoy. That way, you won't give anyone reason to complain about your behavior or performance or your contribution to the greater good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Ah, well; don't let this tide of intense energy sweep you away. Instead, wade carefully and keep your eyes on a fixed point on the horizon.

Regardless, you don't have to live in humorless drudgery. Brightening your appearance is an easy and effective way to brighten your outlook. Put on something colorful and go for a walk out in the sunlight. If the weather's bad, make some hot cocoa and cuddle up with a good book or someone special.

Best of all, you're practical enough to stand back and observe what's going on around you, rather than jumping into the fray without a plan. Use that skill. Think through your options, be discerning in your choices and don't settle for anything less than your best effort. Like the best, you make all this look easy, which is a big part of your ultimate success.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your complaints may be totally valid, but don't go around beating others over the head with them. Instead, you might want to spend the day mending fences or even tearing down useless walls. Old grievances will hurt less once you restructure things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Look as if you mean business -- and actually believe it yourself. Power is sexy, by the way, just in case that little byproduct of your efforts matters to you.
