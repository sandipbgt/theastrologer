Your energy is off -- you're coming across as a stem tyrant rather than a friend or an ally. You want everyone to get in line, except you're not necessarily the expert, or the undisputed leader. Try not to make any enemies. Instead, hand over the reins to someone who's feeling more centered and capable than you are. Let them run things until this bad mood passes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
