Either way, let teamwork turn routine drudgery into something engaging. Don't shut yourself off from the other people in your life -- your sweetheart, your colleagues, your friends. Instead, join them in finishing this thing up, and finishing it strong. Be open to fresh ideas, because forward motion begins now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
