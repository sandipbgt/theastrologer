Your impulsive streak is one of your best traits, but when it flares to life, a little too much daring or exuberance can lead to mistakes. On the positive side, you're quick on your feet, so you learn from your missteps.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your friends and family know you well enough to know that when you're like this, they should just stand back, because you're a force of nature! Your sheer enthusiasm creates a burst of energy all its own. You might even get into trouble under this cosmic influence -- madcap, hilarious trouble that shouldn't have ill effects for anyone.

If you're required to take charge of a group or situation, you should have little trouble -- except that other people are in touch with their inner authorities now, too. You might go head to head with someone whose ego pushes them to challenge your leadership. At least you aren't as emotionally sensitive as usual, so you're willing to go to the mat if necessary.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Whether it's a job, a date, a new house or anything else, gathering your courage and going for it is a great idea.

Lots of folks have an in-your-face way of challenging each other now, and you could get caught in the crossfire, or even become the focus. But don't mistake high-spirited ribbing or debates for actual conflict. There's a distinct difference.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

What's more, you see little reason to hold yourself back from speaking your mind. Other people are similarly bold or even aggressive now. What does all this add up to? For one thing, it means there's great potential for run-ins with folks who try your patience. Do your best not to be insensitive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The current cosmic energy makes you less sensitive than usual to others' feelings. You're just trying to get something accomplished, but you may not realize you've barked or snapped at someone. That could spark a rebellious reaction, and then a full-on confrontation is in effect.

People are in bold, even aggressive moods, so they probably aren't looking out for your feelings. Someone might press a vulnerable spot without realizing what they're doing, simply because they're so focused on pursuing their own goals. You might benefit from such single-mindedness, yourself. At least it would make you more resistant to others' thoughtless comments!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
