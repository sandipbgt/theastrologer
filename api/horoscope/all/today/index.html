Most of all, though, it's important that you're forthright about what you know. Keeping things to yourself won't get you anywhere. Today favors group efforts. Therefore, don't bother guarding special information. Instead, talk to your others and see if they can pitch in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But speaking from the heart is almost always a great route toward success of any kind, and saying just what you mean is easier than usual today, because you know exactly where you want this to go. Since you're feeling so decisive, your eloquence flows, and good things just seem to fall into place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
