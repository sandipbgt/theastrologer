You're looking everywhere and you can't stop, even if you don't know what you're seeking or why. Today, you're just one big worrywart. This kind of tension isn't good for you. Concrete proof would be nice, but don't wait for it to turn up. There must be something else you can do to take your mind off your troubles. If you could forget for long enough, maybe you could leave this whole thing unresolved and just move on. It's worth considering.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your past efforts are finally shifting into gear, so stand back and let them do their stuff. This is the time for appreciating the method to your madness and assuming everything will be OK. It's also a good networking moment if you're not too pushy. You're surrounded by people who could be very useful very soon. Be sure they know a little something about you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That's the real question. You might be easily annoyed if concept and execution don't quite match up today. Oh, come on. Do you really want to be the person who picks a fight over every little thing? Of course not. Nobody aspires to a reputation like that. Your only way out of this mess will be dealing with what is instead of what you think should be.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But you could spend some time with airborne farm animals today as your vivid daydreams overlap your active, physical life. No one else can see these projections or illusions, so they'll probably wonder why you're flapping your arms as you soar with your imagination. And even if it isn't taking you to such silly places, this is going to be a solo flight. Involve others at your peril.

Draw on your abiding sense of what's right. Show your well-mannered side. Let bygones be bygones, and let your potential speak to the future. But don't be planning your next wicked conquest while you're still pretending to be the good guy. Focus on the moment. And if things happen you don't intend, be polite and follow someone else's lead. Share the responsibility instead of taking the blame.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If you're going to all the trouble of making your own world, you deserve to enjoy every little detail. But don't ignore others as you wander through the richness of personal creation. They're not going to let you bail out of your responsibilities. Not that you were planning to flake, were you? That would upset the balance that's letting you take this mental vacation.

As long as you've put your best effort into it, you know you can stand by your work, no matter what anyone else might have to say about it. Tap into your natural creativity, and your output will be even stronger. Best of all, you still like what you do, regardless of whether it's museum-quality. How many people can claim that? Most of us aren't nearly so self-accepting, and the fact that you are is a real gift.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

There's an even better way to move yourself along: Just do your job and do it well. Push and stretch further than you usually do, and leave no stone unturned. You can accomplish great things if you use your natural talents, and you're smart enough to know that if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.

There may be some outstanding charges that need to be worked into your budget.

If you see yourself becoming the thing you hate, push off in the opposite direction. The best way to know your enemy is to become like them.

Maybe you're worried about potential sacrifices, and that could turn you into a dictator. Needless to say, this kind of nervousness is unusual for you. Use this day to reevaluate where you stand. You may be positioned in a very different place from where you thought you were. What's good is that you can move in any direction from here.
