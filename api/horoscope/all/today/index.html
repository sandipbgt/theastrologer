Today is your personal holiday -- no matter what the calendar or your boss might say -- so have fun!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

But be aware of who's listening in on your self-exploration. You might hurt someone's feelings accidentally. Of course, this could be a good lesson: learning to tell the truth in a tactful, gentle way. Perhaps you can improve your communication skills.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

It's chaotic, passionate and wonderfully mixed up, just like humans. Impose your sense of order on the world if you must, but don't get frustrated when the world doesn't want to wedge itself into your neat little boxes. Perhaps the universe's 'master plan' is a bit too big and colorful for that.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Other people want variety, and that's exactly what makes you a bright spot in anyone's day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
