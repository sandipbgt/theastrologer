A conversation or some other issue springs up unexpectedly -- and then something else comes up, and so on. At the end of the day, you might feel tired out with little to show for your efforts. If this happens, just go with it. Perhaps your conversations will prove to be good fodder for future pursuits.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

But don't be surprised if you look back at the end of the day and realize you didn't actually get anything accomplished. If that happens, don't stress out about it. Sometimes, talking is as important as doing, especially if you do a good amount of listening, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
