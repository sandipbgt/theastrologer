Don't worry if you look a little silly. Someone will always laugh no matter what, and there's nothing you can do about it. What you should worry about is finding the right inspiration and making the right calls. Have faith in your choices. Otherwise you might amplify the wrong thing with your big energy, and then looking silly would be the least of your troubles. Ideally, you should be laughing with everyone so they're not laughing at you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Your sporty good looks don't make you a good sport today. Lighten up to make it through this passionate and uncomfortable period. The way you see things is just one view among many.

You'll see opportunities that others won't, and your job may be as subtle as giving out hints or as obvious as shoving the totally clueless in the right direction. One way or another, you'll work it out so that everyone gets their share. Oh, and don't worry about getting your share.

Don't worry about missing out on anything. You'll know when things start happening, because opportunity will come knocking at your door.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Now you can draw on your experience to shape what happens next -- and that will be whatever you want it to be. You're in charge, because you're thinking so positively. This mood is like gold.

There are people out there who might think like enemies, and you still need to show your superiors you can't be fooled.

The world is a lot more complicated than you'd like to believe. Don't trust anyone who tells you independent thinking is a waste of time.

For instance, be more tactful around the have-nots. You don't want to rub their noses in what's missing from their lives. If you can't share, at least don't show off.
