Life isn't a long, slow, steady train, you know -- it's more like a roller coaster, with lots of ups and downs. If you're in a down, try taking a more proactive approach. You can offer someone constructive advice, or better yet, focus on how you yourself can work to improve the situation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

They're probably a little peeved at you today -- instead of staying calm and working with them, you're letting yourself get all uptight and controlling. Change might make you a little jumpy today, but dive in, even if it seems like a challenge. It's called 'personal growth.' You can do it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
