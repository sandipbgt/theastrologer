It's especially important to make it clear to your spouse or business partner that you're open to teamwork and compromise. This may mean biting your tongue instead of speaking out, but that's a good skill to develop. This is about learning to choose your battles.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Being stubborn would be a mistake, since it would send the other person a clear message that you aren't willing to compromise. And that likely isn't the case.

It's a good day to get back on track if things have become imbalanced between you. After all, even minor inequalities can build up over time.
