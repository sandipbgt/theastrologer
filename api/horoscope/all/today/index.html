        "horoscope": "Patience and good humor might be fleeting today, but you should still capitalize on them when you feel them. Do make sure your jokes are appropriate, though, so you don't offend anyone. People who don't understand what's going on will quickly annoy you. Some people are just so clueless! Instead of judging them, try to meet them not just halfway, but a little more than that. They might not recognize your effort, but you will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Strange needs are driving you forward against the stream. Call it creative tension or artistic license -- either way, you're not seeing things quite the same way as everyone else. Today, the outcome will be as important as the process. The changes you make now will have measurable results.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
