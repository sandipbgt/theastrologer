When talking with someone, you're able to read between the lines. You can hear what they don't say almost as clearly as what they do say, and it speaks volumes. The kind of intimacy you can create now could be mind-blowing, simply because it opens the door to your soul.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Your response may be to intellectualize your feelings instead of just, well, feeling them.
