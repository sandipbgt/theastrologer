Be forthright about your intentions. That includes admitting your mistakes, as difficult as that is. You'll find, though, that once you start doing it, it gets a lot easier. This could be a learning curve, but you can handle it. Being humble and open to life's lessons still counts as doing your best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're demonstrating to people just how sterling your character and principles are, and they're inclined to get behind you in whatever project or venture you're trying start. Pay attention to anything in your life that needs closure, too. Think how nice a cleared-off desk will be.

And the truth is, that's what you'll be today, unless you do your best not to wallow in your worries. These anxieties aren't such a big deal. But at the moment, you're convinced they are. Give your friends and family a break, if possible. Smile and make light conversation. If you need a few moments to freak out, find a quiet spot to be alone, and remind yourself that this, too, shall pass.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
