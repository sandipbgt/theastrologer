But whatever you're feeling, it's impossibly sweet, because this is you in your most intense and distilled form: a creature of pure emotion. Just remember that feelings are subjective. In a day or two, or even an hour or two, yours are likely to change. Enjoy this ride, but don't take it too seriously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
