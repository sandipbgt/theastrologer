Today is perfect for assessing your work and other areas of your life looking for constructive improvements. That doesn't mean it should be all work and no play, however. Enjoy yourself. Revel in the sweetness of life and the company of good friends. In fact, creating a nice balance between business and pleasure is the best way to go now.

You have the potential to be anything you want. You have the chops to make it happen in simple or spectacular ways. You also have some actual plans for the future, and for once they look real from ground level. See what you can do with all this over the next month.

So if you happen to be there when someone else's juicy details leak out, don't be so quick to share that stuff with the gossip hounds. Yes, you know people like that, and maybe you've been one.

OK, maybe you're butting in where nobody asked you to be, but once they hear what you have to say, they'll be forced to admit that you're right and they're not. It also helps if you're right on time instead of after the fact, because hindsight isn't that impressive here and now. Experience is always valuable, though. You've been there, you've done that - now you're passing it on. That's how advice works.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Today, you'll gain insight into your own mind and heart, and the fact that you're less emotional than usual will help you analyze this information effectively.

Right now you're utterly conventional, and you like it that way. Let this be the norm.

Don't be so petty and old-fashioned. Don't keep enforcing rules that no one cares about any more. You really hate it when others get that way. Maybe you always said things would be different if you ran the circus. Well, guess what. Now it's your turn.

If you can be more observant during uneasy time, you won't be so overbearing to others. The thing is, their seemingly radical ideas aren't really that out-there. Try to be more open instead of dismissing them out of hand. You might even need to hand over the lead on any projects you've got going, which is hard for you to do. If nothing else, go easy on yourself. Things aren't as bad as they might seem.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

In some area of your life, your ambitions are causing tension. Maybe it's the way you're trying to communicate your ideas. At the moment, it's hard to avoid saying things you'll regret.

And if you're the one whose bells and whistles are about to turn into smoke and mirrors, well, why would you want to draw so much attention to what you lack? Stop working at cross-purposes with your best interests. Today should be sane and sober.

As usual, your mind is in the clouds as you dream of getting what you want. Still, stay attuned to the task at hand, whatever that might be. Remember, you're trying to avoid certain outcomes, not trigger them prematurely. Pay attention to your health, too.
