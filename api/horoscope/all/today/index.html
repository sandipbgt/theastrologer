In your eyes, they're making changes purely for the sake of change. But keep quiet. Soon, the method will emerge from the madness. It'll all start to make sense. And if it doesn't, you can just mutter 'I told you so' under your breath and move on.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's a great day to launch a project, preferably with the help of a group of friends or coworkers. With the support of other people, you can brainstorm ways to make your work even more creative and unique.
