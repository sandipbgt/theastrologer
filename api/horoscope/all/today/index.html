Instead, focus on getting just one or two things done, but done thoroughly and well. That way, you'll know your efforts aren't wasted. If you shove forward too fast, you're likely to make mistakes that you'll have to correct later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Make time for some fun and relaxation, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
