        "horoscope": "You're in your element today. Your feelings are strong, perhaps even overwhelming. But there's something you actually enjoy about existing in such an emotional head space. Being this closely in touch with your own heart helps you understand others' feelings better. It increases your sense of compassion for the people around you. You can listen carefully and give excellent advice, because you truly relate to others' issues.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

There's such release in facing a problem or inspecting your feelings at a deep, uncomfortable level. Just make sure you aren't creating a problem purely for that rush of feeling. It's wonderful to work through issues, and the current influence certainly supports that. But if life is light and easy right now, don't make it harder or darker!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Quick responses to emotional situations could just make things worse, whereas a levelheaded view will help keep everyone calm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Put more bluntly, don't be surprised if someone takes offense when none was intended. You may have to do damage control.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
