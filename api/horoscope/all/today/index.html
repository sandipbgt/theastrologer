But these are just the kind of behaviors lots of people are displaying now -- almost compulsively! Still, you do have control over yourself. The stronger your feelings are today, the more careful you should be in how you express them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Instead of talking openly to everyone who will listen about your feelings or your plans, adopt a quiet alertness. Keep your eyes and ears open, and your mouth closed. This may seem unfriendly, but it's not. Sometimes it's just smart to protect yourself. Keep things under wraps until you know it's the right time to reveal the truth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Either way, processing your emotions is important. But find a private, safe way to do so. Try writing about them in your journal or talking them out with a trusted -- and neutral -- friend or counselor. That will help you get a better handle on them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

The only trouble is, this isn't the best day for working through your emotional wounds. Your perspective is highly subjective. It's hard to stay levelheaded when someone hurts your feelings. It actually might be better to sit on your feelings for a few days, to gain clarity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
