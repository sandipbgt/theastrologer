        "horoscope": "Issues of jealousy or intimacy may come up today in one of your close relationships. You might feel possessive of your sweetheart or a close friend, jealous of the time they spend away from you. If so, take a look at the root of that emotion. Deep down, you just want to be closely connected with this person you care so much about. Instead of acting on your possessive feelings, try communicating love.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're quite aware of the connections you share with other people, and the many ways in which you rely on them on a regular basis.

This could lead to an enjoyably intense encounter with someone, but it could also lead to a difficult one, if you aren't careful to temper your feelings and reactions. Raw emotion can be enlightening -- transformative, even -- but it can also be difficult and hurtful.

You may see your friends or coworkers getting all worked up about not much, expressing passion in all its forms. If you're smart, you'll sit back and let everyone welter around you!

If someone hurts your feelings, you're likely to react quickly, before you've really considered the situation. Later, you might realize you overreacted -- but by then, it's too late.
