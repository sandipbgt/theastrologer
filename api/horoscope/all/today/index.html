        "horoscope": "Today's cosmic energy is perfect for getting in touch with the divine. Okay, maybe that made you laugh. You're a naturally lighthearted person, after all. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't tap into the sacred side of life sometimes! And if you do so today, you can use it to make deep connections with yourself, your loved ones and that indefinable force that makes life so wonderfully blessed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Your compassion swells today. Your big heart grows even larger. You're willing to do just about anything to help others, because you're even more aware than usual of their needs and their pain. If someone near you is feeling vulnerable, you'll pick up on it, even if they're broadcasting bravado. This is a real gift. If you use it with care, you can help people feel more comfortable in their own skin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You're in a sympathetic mood today, and compassion comes more easily than usual. You may find yourself being more lenient in your expectations of yourself or other people. This is a smart move, because lots of people are easily distracted now -- you included. It's hard to apply yourself to your responsibilities with the usual level of dedication.

Your psychic abilities are keen, enabling you to tap into subtle strains of emotion that reveal the deepest truths about people and situations. For example, you can tell if a friend is feeling gloomy, even if they put on a brave face and claim nothing is wrong. You can be a great help to others, but don't allow yourself to get too wrapped up in their problems.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're always considering others' feelings before your own; you're so compassionate. But sometimes you're that way to a fault.
