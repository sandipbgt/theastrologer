This is one of those days when, if you follow your instincts, you might end up in a power struggle or otherwise in a tough spot. But if you consciously remind yourself to remain calm and take it easy, you could have a really pleasant day. It's all about enjoying yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
