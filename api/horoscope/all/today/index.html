        "horoscope": "This may be an awkward day, emotionally speaking. You sense a certain distance between yourself and others, or perhaps this detachment is internal. Either way, it's uncomfortable. Normally, you're so closely attuned with yourself and your loved ones. But perhaps you can view this as a welcome break from life's emotional ups and downs. Sometimes, it's nice just to push forward in your projects without getting mired down in feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
