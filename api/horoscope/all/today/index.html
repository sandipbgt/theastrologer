And while you mean no one any harm, your bold, brash way of dealing with people could push someone's buttons. Be careful to respect others' feelings and sensitivities. Go out of your way to play nice. If you're so gentle you feel silly, that just might be soft enough!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You may feel others' feelings as acutely as if they were your own. At the very least, you're probably able to sense someone's sadness or anxiety. This puts you in a great position to help them through their troubles, simply by offering them a kind word or a gentle hug.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

As detail-oriented as you are, you might have fun tweaking a recipe until it's perfect! If cooking isn't your thing, treat yourself and someone you love to a meal out on the town.
