        "horoscope": "It's difficult for you to trust your instincts if you can't see any logical basis for them. But today's energy urges you to do just that -- to suspend your disbelief enough to tap into the wisdom of your own unconscious mind. Accept the cues and messages your higher self is trying to send your way. That's the best way to hone your intuition, after all. Taking it seriously improves its accuracy exponentially.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Many people feel moody under the current influence. It's okay to retreat if that makes you feel more secure. Take it as easy as your schedule allows. If you have a lot of work ahead of you, schedule in breaks, or even mini-naps.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That has the added benefit of more time in dreamland -- that wonderfully imaginative place that your mind visits so easily under the current influence.

Spending time with someone you love could take on almost spiritual significance, because you're able to see that you aren't just two separate people; you're two souls, conjoined. If someone near you needs help, you'll do anything you can for them, selflessly disregarding your own comfort to come to their aid.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
