Your energy is especially high, and you're feeling worked up and suspicious of other people's motives. It's easy to read into things they say and do, but don't assume you're seeing them clearly. On days like this, it's always best to err on the side of kindness, forgiveness and turning the other cheek, even if the warrior within you wants to charge!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Make a conscious effort to stay calm and open-minded, because the tendency is strong now to project all kinds of feelings and intentions onto other people -- and many times, these projections will be negative in tone. Guard against this,. Don't assume anything at work or at home. If a suspicious feeling sneaks into your consciousness, don't act on it! Ask the other person for clarification.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Lean on these people today,. And try not to attach any importance to other people's emotional outbursts. You're sensitive by nature, but you don't have to absorb their negativity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
