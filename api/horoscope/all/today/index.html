        "horoscope": "Today it seems even more important than usual to spend time with loved ones. You may be feeling quite emotionally sensitive, and being close to the people you trust is a real comfort. Of course, if there's tension or discord at home, that could add to the sense of unease. In that case, rely on your natural skills as a negotiator to get people talking. You can work through rough patches gracefully.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You're a wanderer at heart, but today, home calls you. You just don't feel like getting out and about. Comfort takes a high priority now. Of course, if there's tension at home or among your loved ones, that may not provide much comfort at all. In that case, do your best to be a peacemaker. Talk things out, or at least soften the tension with kindness and humor.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You're far more at ease now in the company of family or longtime friends than among strangers. Stay home, if you can. If not, keep that warm, connected feeling alive with a phone call or email. That's the beauty of modern technology. You can feel close to home, no matter where you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Of course, words will probably be involved! But telling someone you love or support them is even more powerful when you back it up with action. So give a friend a hug.
