Maybe you're the messenger of the gods, carrying out divine work that's important to us all. Or, maybe you're just looking out for number one, pursuing your own interests with your wheeling and dealing. Either way, you win, so make it count for something good.

Diplomacy will be critical to your success. It's certainly worth the wait and effort. Even if you feel as if you're spinning your wheels, you're not.

Why do this to yourself? If you don't stop it right now, you'll have a vacant, gloomy day. Restart the party soon, OK?
