You know the feeling -- searching for something to make you feel better, but nothing seems to work! When this happens, it's probably because you aren't hungry. Some feeling or memory is pushing at you. Go ahead and focus on it, even if it's sad or bittersweet. That's the only way to process through it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
