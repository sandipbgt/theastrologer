Better yet, why not spend the day doing research, talking to people and gathering more information and opinions? That way, you can make a more informed decision later, one you'll be sure is the right one. If you try to make a move prematurely, you'll just end up having to backtrack and correct your mistake.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Developing a more durable hide might be today's important lesson for you, however. For instance, if someone is nasty toward you, don't dignify them with a response. The path of least resistance is better than wasting time with hurt feelings, or flaring up and starting a fight. And who knows? Perhaps you were just feeling overly sensitive. Maybe they didn't mean anything by it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
