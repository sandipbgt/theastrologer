At the very least, you have a great, progressive idea about improving some part of your immediate surroundings. Of course, your perspective could change dramatically throughout the day. If so, let it. You're brainstorming. There's no reason to stick to one path when so many others keep opening up before you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "This could be one of those one-step-forward, two-steps-back kind of days. It seems like you keep having to redo work you already completed, or re-explaining things you already said. Maybe you're just missing details, though usually the small stuff is your forte. Try slowing down and being more cautious in your progress. Perhaps being more conscious of your words and actions will help you be more thorough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You might spend the day on the phone or glued to your computer, exchanging instant messages or emails with people all over the globe. In meetings, you can express yourself with charm and eloquence, which helps you convince others to join you in your corner. It's a great day for pushing a project or other agenda.

You could simply chat with friends and strangers, but why not channel this energy? Networking and brainstorming are both great ways to use the current influence. Contact people about a project or cause that means a lot to you. Use persuasive words, charm and humor to gain their support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The words to express your feelings are right there at the surface. It's a great day to catch up with an old friend or even to talk with a counselor, if you have any issues you'd like to work through.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And the truth is, while your mind is racing ahead, it's actually hard to get much accomplished in this state of mind. You're too distracted by every bright, shiny, noisy person or idea you encounter. On the other hand, this is a highly creative state, so enjoy it!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

As soon as you finish describing one profound emotion, it may shift into something completely different. On second thought, maybe it's better just to process things on your own! That way, you won't confuse anyone but yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "It's a good day to put your feelings into words. Even complex emotions find expression now, because it's so much easier than usual to describe abstract images or complicated situations. This makes it a great day to write in your journal, talk with a friend, or visit your therapist. Self-analysis is great now because you won't let yourself get too bogged down in feeling. You'll simply think, talk and process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Soon, your fingers start tapping again, and your eyes start darting toward the clock or the door. Find an escape if you can. If you can't, it's a great time to plan one for the near future, since you're more attuned to details than usual.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Wonderfully witty, imaginative ideas appear out of nowhere -- but if you aren't careful to record them in some way, they'll fade into the ether. Your creativity is high, but you may not have the presence of mind to follow through even on the most brilliant idea. Save it for later, when your motivation is higher.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

The phone might ring off the hook, or your instant-message may chime again and again, signaling that there's yet more communication to handle. And in the end, is anything of substance really getting across? Maybe, or maybe not. Do your best to pass along important information, and keep idle chitchat to a minimum.

If this occurs, remind yourself that the other person is just being curious. Lots of people are especially interested today in any little detail that comes up. But you might feel as if they're being too inquisitive for your comfort. Reveal what you want, and hide the rest. It's your prerogative.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
