You're content to stay on the sidelines and cheer on your favorite performers, such as your friends or children. Bragging just isn't your style. You'd rather heap adoration on someone who deserves it. But if the opportunity arises today to strut your stuff a little, why not give in to it? Revealing a hidden talent gives other people a lift.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
