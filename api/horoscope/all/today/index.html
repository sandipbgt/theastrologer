But depending on your personality, you could go pretty dark with this! It's a good time to get into complex, mysterious subjects -- and you do love uncovering secrets. But respect others' privacy, and think twice before dabbling in strangeness for its own sake.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

You see a need for improvement on a broader scale, and you know you can make that difference. Bravo! Pat yourself on the back for this generous urge -- and then get to work. Be sure to think outside the box, because that's where you'll find the best, most workable ideas.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

If this is uncomfortable for you, that's probably a positive thing. You tend to be set in your opinions, so it's good to have those firm beliefs challenged once in a while! An experience or conversation may confirm what you've thought all along, but it may prompt a more open world view.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
