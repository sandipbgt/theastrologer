Somehow the soft breeze of generosity is wafting across you today, and you realize exactly how much you have that you could share. This extends beyond money to time, space and possessions. Rather than hoard these things for yourself, open up your resources to those less fortunate. You'll be doing more good than you know.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "A vague urge for freedom blossoms today into a distinct need, one that won't be ignored. Many times this might cause issues in your immediate life, but today is different. Rather than fighting against the daily demands that bind you, you find internal independence. If you want an adventure but can't chase down your own, get a friend or coworker to recount one of theirs. Secondhand is better than none at all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

And it's not that things are exactly bad today; you just don't see eye-to-eye with a lot of other people. Soon enough, you'll all be able to explain yourselves. In the meantime, work on your sense of tolerance and letting go -- two qualities you're still trying to develop in this lifetime,.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

So meditate, light a candle, attend a church service -- in any way that's meaningful to you, take a few moments to be reverent.
