Don't tempt fate with a fistful of dollars or euros. Wouldn't you rather buy security than trouble? Before you lay your hard-earned cash down on anything frivolous, ask yourself the hard questions: Is it quality? Will it last for years?

This would also be a good time to take a short vacation, as contradictory as that seems to the idea of practical living.
