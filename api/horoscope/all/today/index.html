You'd rather deny your own needs than cause tension with a business partner or close friend. And yet -- aren't your needs important, too? Isn't your opinion as valid as anyone else's? Instead of backing down today, look for a way to compromise. Everyone can have their needs met.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
