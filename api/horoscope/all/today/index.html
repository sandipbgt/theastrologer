But you don't have to let that happen. Just be flexible when plans or objectives shift. Take it as a challenge -- you're used to planning carefully and following those plans to a T, but days like this give you a chance to think creatively.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
