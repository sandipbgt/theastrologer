Right now, it's time to focus and take care of business. Apply yourself to a project at work, even if it's tedious. Live up to your responsibilities at home, even if you would rather duck them. Prove to yourself and others that you're reliable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "Today you're capable of tremendous focus, which you can put toward any subject or endeavor. But certain areas of life call your attention more than others now. Finances, including savings and investment strategies, may be especially engrossing now. Your work is also a high priority at the moment. You can really get absorbed in serious matters, even ones you might normally avoid because they're just too heavy or tedious.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You want to be dependable for your employer or your loved ones, and that desire goes a long way.

But while this go-for-it attitude is appropriate in certain arenas -- being proactive at work, for example, or aggressive on the basketball court -- it may not go over so well among friends and family.

You're also careful in communicating with other people, whether regarding personal or professional matters. This is a good thing, especially if you're trying to conduct any type of business or to make a good impression.

On the other hand, this is one of those days that could surprise you. You might learn that following rules and accepting limitations actually affords you a great deal of freedom.

Instead, it's a day for respecting those systems and routines. Work with what is already established.
