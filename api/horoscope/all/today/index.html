The current energy makes many people feel more sensitive than usual, which can have both positive and challenging effects. On the positive side, it's a wonderful day to share a loving or romantic moment with someone who is dear to you. On the challenging side, feelings could be hurt, either yours or theirs.

In this mood, it's important to protect yourself, but it's also a good time to reveal your true feelings, including needs and hurts, to someone. Even if this leads to a difficult conversation, it can create much greater understanding and intimacy between you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

        "horoscope": "You may experience some emotional ups and downs today. Many people are feeling moody under the current influence, and that's the rub. You tend to react to your emotions without thinking, which can make a tense situation even tougher, especially if you've misinterpreted someone's statement or actions. It's better to take a few deep breaths and consider things before you react, but that's harder to do when you're feeling so thin-skinned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
