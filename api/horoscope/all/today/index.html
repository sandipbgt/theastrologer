This is a good day to finish up an endeavor or resolve an issue you've been facing. Take a deep breath. Remember to focus your energy on tying up loose ends rather than starting something new, or going in a completely different direction. And as you work alongside friends or colleagues, be kind as well as driven. Newcomers and those unaccustomed to your love of detail may need a day or so to get up to speed.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

It's not just about making yourself useful, though. It's also about looking good while you do all this stuff.
