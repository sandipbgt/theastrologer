        "horoscope": "If you feel untouchable it's only because they can't touch you. You're so far out front that they're just an annoying dust cloud in your rear view mirror. Your boundaries are more like zones than lines, meaning that nothing unwanted can penetrate because you'll see it coming from a long way off. So you get to ignore everyone else's artificial standards today. You know you're wonderful, and so will the right people. You'd let them touch you, right? Don't be shy once it's clear that you share the same idea of perfection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

The jokes might serve your purposes, but your awareness of what's actually going on is much bigger than comedy. Each random  piece is part of someone's grand scheme. Maybe you can help them, or maybe you know enough to stay out of their way. Sometimes you can do yourself the biggest favor of all by not getting involved with other people's craziness. As you know, you can be crazy enough on your own.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Wanderlust will drag you out of your seat today, spiriting you away to be the guest of honor at a party of one. But there's no guarantee it'll be all fun and games. How prepared are you for a challenge? You might be anxious and emotional, and who would you turn to then? Why not accept your adventures as they come?

There's always some kind of trick for fixing things in your memory. Put it in whatever order makes sense. Even if you're not actively learning, concentrate your thoughts and efforts today. If you believe you can turn a temporary gig into a permanent fixture, go for it.

You'll be a benign force today, and your hands and karma are clean. But you may be wondering, now that you don't have an edge, can you get others' attention? Never fear. The old saying about drawing more flies with honey applies here. People will pay attention to you precisely because you're openhearted and welcoming. You don't need to throw your weight around to get support. Set your ego aside and work with other people to get something accomplished.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Others can feel the energy you broadcast, even if you're not openly staring at them. Laugh about that if you want, but it's true. You'd feel it if someone was studying you from a distance, too. But none of this is helping you. It's time to ground yourself in structured, purposeful reality. Be happy where you are. Accept what is. Love the one you're with.

Whatever you need is probably in your hands or rolling around in your back seat right now, because all these familiar tools and materials have other uses, too. And now you're getting a full day to explore what they are. Sound out the options and listen to those echoes bouncing back from the future.

Maybe your complaints are legit, but if you're protesting too loudly, maybe you see yourself in them. Yes, it can put a dent in your mood when someone else is suddenly acting out your own unresolved issues. Let the understanding begin. Sooner or later you'll have to see eye to eye with these people.

There's no room for cowards in the battles you have to fight. Dare to be great today. It's hard not to flaunt a little of the power and the glory.

Thank those who make it possible. Share with those who need a little something extra.

This is also a good time to settle an issue with a friend or even to say goodbye to a person or behavior that no longer plays a positive role in your life. You'll have less anxiety than usual about letting go, because the moment is simply right for it. Plus, neat endings appeal to you. Other people can benefit from this mood of yours, too.
