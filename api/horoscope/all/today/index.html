Don't forget the help your friends and allies can give you if you ask for it.

You've earned the right to sit back and admire your handiwork. You're doing OK, so give yourself a pat on the back.

This is a great time to go your own way, if you can find it. If you can grab a close friend on your way out, so much the better.

Be where you say you'll be, bring a little something extra, and know when to throw it down for maximum effect. In other words, recognize your own powers and don't be afraid to use them every chance you get.
