Instead, relax a little and let things take their natural course. That's hard for you, isn't it? Try to enjoy the break. But do be conservative as you count and codify the variables. There's no need to relax your principles or your expectations. Keep a careful log of any progress you make, and soon you can match it against the outcome you initially projected.

Don't worry if you suddenly notice that your ego isn't along for the ride. Who cares if this little excursion of yours looks weird? Now you get to actually be who you are.

A gentle approach goes best with everyone from your best friend to your lover to your boss.
