You're just raising expectations for success and/or setting yourself up for spectacular failure. Instead of taking the risk of going down in a blaze of glory, why not opt for a day of silent, modest greatness? That would include more trust and tolerance for people who, as far as you're concerned, lack your gifts and advantages. But even if you really are a superior being, don't act like one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

In fact, the smartest thing you could do is broadcast your intentions today. Once other people understand what you're all about, they'll find ways to get your energy mixed up in their business. Clearly your professional and social lives could take off from here. Try to have as many different experiences as you can. Having them all at once would be especially cool, since you can actually handle the variety now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

And whether you throw yourself into the moment with sacred fervor or profane delight, feel free to ask questions, explore new avenues, and diversify your interests. It'll be OK to spread yourself thin today. There will be enough of you to go around.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Even though you might feel that you're acting the hero, remember that you're living in the real world and playing with real.
