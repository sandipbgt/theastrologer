It's all about being centered in who you are and what you're capable of. Of course, this kind of self-awareness could easily lead to smug self-satisfaction. It's a good thing that, although you might feel superior, you know enough not to act that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
