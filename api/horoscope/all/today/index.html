But overall, complaining about your perceived problems will only make things seem worse than they are. Energy flowing where attention goes: You choose where to place your focus. If you choose to highlight your feelings of anxiety or insecurity, those feelings will grow. Don't let that happen -- take action instead. It all starts with a small, positive step forward.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

So put your best foot forward, and don't worry too much about whether you're headed in the right direction.
