You may find that you can't live up to your own expectations, or perhaps to the pressure you feel coming from someone else who demands a lot from you. This is one of those days when it's extra important to find the balance between doing your best and knowing your own limits. Good enough, after all, is good enough.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

You want and intend to fulfill your responsibilities, and you genuinely care about pleasing others. This helps you stay on task, even when you'd rather set your duties aside and relax a little.
