        "horoscope": "Today, your usual, extroverted self turns inward as responsibilities claim your attention. Work may demand extra hours, or family duties might weigh on your mind. This could even seem a bit depressing. But the best you can do is to carry your burdens gracefully. Life won't stay difficult for long, so focus now. Be thorough and methodical, and cover all your bases. That way, you won't have to redo anything later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

        "horoscope": "You're quite goal-oriented today. This helps you work industriously toward a specific outcome. And when your energy is this directed, there's very little you can't accomplish! Whatever you need to do, you're willing and able to do, whether that means networking, researching or simply putting your back into it. Best of all, you can serve as an example to your children or coworkers -- anyone who is watching you do what you do best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

And though work may not be your top choice of activities, it's nice to feel this grounded. Sometimes life is like an emotional roller coaster, but now, you're even-keeled. Immerse yourself in your work. Tackle your duties with energy. Get the job done so you can get back to your hobbies and loved ones.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Instead of dwelling in a state of anxiety, why not do something proactive about the problem? Focus on strengthening anything related to your money or career. Hard work yields good results now.

The job may be tedious, and it probably won't be much fun. But apply yourself to it wholeheartedly, with great focus and concentration. That's the best way to get through it.

The hare represents everyone around you who ignores rules and works quickly, just trying to get the job done. And the tortoise? That's you -- moving ahead in slow, steady, methodical steps. That's the best way to do any job today, because it's the only way to ensure that you'll reach the finish line.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

That way, you can be as efficient as you like, and no one will get in your way. If you have to cooperate with others, you may find yourself being impatient with them for no good reason.

        "horoscope": "Watch for defensive or controlling behavior today. You may feel cranky due to increased responsibilities at work or at home. Your burden feels heavy, in part because your energy isn't as high as you're used to. But being short with a coworker or your spouse won't help the situation, and in fact will contribute to the tension. It's a good day for solo work, if possible.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Today, concentrate on moving through your responsibilities. Keep your favorite form of relaxation -- a bath, a nap, curling up with a good book -- in mind as a goal. That way, once you cross everything off your task list, you can reward yourself with an activity you really enjoy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

There is a particular process to almost everything you do, whether that's picking up the dry cleaning, working, or simply doing busy work around the house. Your motto for the day? Respect the process! This shouldn't be too difficult. Though you do like to be innovative, you also gain a pleasing sense of stability from working within known confines. And doing that is your best bet today.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

Thus, you're able to be persistent, even when making tough decisions that you'd normally shy away from. This is your inner strength shining forth, gentle! Doesn't it feel good to know you can step up to the plate when you need to?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
