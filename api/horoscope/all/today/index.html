Imposing a bit of order on your surroundings will help clear your mind of the cobwebs that have accumulated over the past day or so. Then, once you have a clear, organized space, you'll be able to make better sense of what's required of you. It's so much easier to concentrate when you don't have a thousand distractions around you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
