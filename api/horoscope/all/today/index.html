        "horoscope": "Emotional showdowns are possible today. Your challenge is to embrace these confrontations, instead of trying to minimize or avoid them. Right now it's easy to react against anything you perceive as an insult or a limitation. For example, someone might hurt your feelings, or they might seem overly demanding of your attention. But exploring your own reactions could reveal important underlying themes of your relationship, providing a path to growth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",

Everyone shares a deep-rooted need for attachment. Unlike many people, you understand this at a conscious level.
