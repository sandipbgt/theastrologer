Your ideas are often good ones, but today should be about togetherness and high spirits, not bossiness or control. Here's a good way to challenge yourself: Instead of asserting your own point of view, cooperate with someone else's vision, and throw yourself into bringing it alive. Now, doesn't that feel good?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
