    "horoscope": "You might talk so much today that you wear out your voice by evening! Self-expression and communication take center stage now. You could simply chat with friends and strangers, but why not channel this energy? Networking and brainstorming are both great ways to use the current influence. Contact people about a project or cause that means a lot to you. Use persuasive words, charm and humor to gain their support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
