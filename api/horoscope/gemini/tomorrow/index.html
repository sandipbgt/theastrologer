    "horoscope": "Today, serious issues may arise around career or family responsibilities. Instead of taking these issues seriously, you might laugh them off or intellectualize them in some way. Be sure to give problems the attention they deserve. Not everything can be explained away. Sooner or later, you may have to put in hard effort in order to fix something that has broken down. Today may be that day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
