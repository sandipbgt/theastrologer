That could mean attending a talk or a book reading, going to a gallery opening or simply having an interesting discussion with friends. You'll notice that each of those examples is a social event. That's because this is no time for being alone. Your best ideas will happen in group settings as you play off other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
