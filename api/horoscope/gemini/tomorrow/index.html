    "horoscope": "Feelings of annoyance, or worse, could get the better of you today, but only if you let them. If you think you hate something or someone, it's probably just your mood. Of course, hearing that may not make you feel any better -- but listing their positive qualities will. They have plenty, you know. And focusing on them might help you tone down the negativity. Doesn't being positive feel so much better than being a critical grouch? It's better for your health, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
