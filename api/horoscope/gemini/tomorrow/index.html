    "horoscope": "It feels good to be around familiar people and places today. You might feel the urge to sleep in or take a nap, because your own bed is a very comforting place to be! Good friends are also a comfort. If you're going through an emotional phase, there's nothing like talking it out with someone you love and trust. They can offer you much needed support, advice and general emotional sustenance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
