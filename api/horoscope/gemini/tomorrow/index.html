    "horoscope": "Your eyes are lighting up with understanding. And listen to yourself speak! Today you're fluent in the languages of both heart and mind. Explore with youthful optimism and that feeling of all-the-time-in-the-world. Compete with all the rules and tricks you know. Challenges stir your blood with demands to prove or defend something. If it's a reasonable challenge, respond ASAP. If it seems unreasonable, think about why you should get involved. Because, in spite of that surging feeling, you really don't have all the time in the world. Be smart about using what you do have.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
