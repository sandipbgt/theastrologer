    "horoscope": "It's a good day for considering where you want to go in the next few weeks of your life, and making some plans to get there. If you aren't feeling very decisive, that's okay. Just spend some time today thinking about what you'd like to accomplish. Write your ideas down, or talk them over with a friend or coworker. You can refine them as you go, and they'll swell in scope and creativity.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
