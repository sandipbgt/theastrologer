You'll find your notes are important for your future, even if they seem a little mundane at first glance. Just remember that sometimes the simplest, most obvious idea actually is the best one. And if you work through your thoughts with your friends or coworkers, they may be able to help you brainstorm something truly inspired.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
