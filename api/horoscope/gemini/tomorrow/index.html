    "horoscope": "Today, you're a whirling dervish, or maybe a social butterfly. You love freedom and crave variety, and you'll do whatever it takes to make them happen. Get out of the house, or even out of town -- just focus on short-term fun rather than long-term changes. If adjusting the status quo suddenly seems essential, be sure to consider the hidden costs. This restless mood will pass soon,, and then you might wish you'd left well enough alone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
