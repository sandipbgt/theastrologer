    "horoscope": "You see yourself as rational, but the people with whom you're working may have a different view of things. If you don't want to end up working alone, make the effort to compromise. Try to take a calm, objective view of your own behavior and attitude. Can you spot any ways in which you're being bossy or insensitive? If so, admit your mistakes, apologize and move forward. You'll gain everyone's respect if you handle things in a professional, straightforward way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
