    "horoscope": "You're feeling creative today. At least, you would be if you could make any sense at all of the impressions and feelings currently swamping your consciousness. The best you might be able to manage is just letting these emotions come, and sitting with them as they pass through. If you're lucky, some thought or image will make sense to you. If so, write it down so you can revisit it later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
