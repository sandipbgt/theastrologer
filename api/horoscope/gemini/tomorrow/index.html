A dinner party is a great diversion, or a board game played with your family. Everyone is in a mellow, affectionate mood, though you may find yourself chuckling when someone gets a little stubborn about some small, insignificant issue. Good thing you have such a good sense of humor,!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
