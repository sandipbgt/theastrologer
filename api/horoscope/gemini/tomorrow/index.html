    "horoscope": "If there's romance in your life, it comes in quick, passionate bursts and then moves on. If you're a friend or relative, there's no need to process every little thing. You're affectionate but brisk. You'll speak your love with an honest, open heart, but you won't necessarily hang around to prove it. Your natural talents are calling you elsewhere today. People can expect a light touch and easy harmonies from you. If you're expecting a relationship problem waiting for you when you get back, you'll deal with it then.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
