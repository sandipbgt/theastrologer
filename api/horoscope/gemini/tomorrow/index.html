    "horoscope": "Personal matters and intimate relationships could get tangled today. It's as if all sense of logic or reason has been tossed out the window, and all that's left is pure emotion. In some cases, that can be quite powerful, not to mention enjoyable. In others, it might seem as if everyone has gone temporarily cuckoo! Try to keep a sense of perspective, especially in an emotional showdown with someone you care about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
