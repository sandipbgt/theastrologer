    "horoscope": "You're breezy but grounded, spinning like a windmill in no danger of getting dizzy and falling over. You're sensitive without being fragile. You're feeling those emotional tides without letting them shatter or erode you. You're a brave hero with a wicked sense of humor, and it's all because you know who you are. Be proud of where you've been. Be optimistic about where you're going. You could accomplish today if that's what needs to happen. And with all these vivid metaphors about yourself, you're like a walking work of art. People might pay just to see you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
