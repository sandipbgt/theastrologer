    "horoscope": "You're in a dreamy, imaginative mood today. Your thoughts, usually so quick and sharp, are now more fanciful. It's a wonderful day to give yourself time to daydream. Let your mind wander into the realm of fantasy. You might find great inspiration for your next creative work. At the very least, it's a relief to leave cold, hard logic behind for a day, and dabble exclusively in your boundless imagination.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
