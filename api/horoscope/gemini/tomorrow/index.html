Instead of a lighthearted sharing of information -- your favorite kind of discussion -- people are getting all caught up in details. Of course, you think they're just splitting hairs, but there's probably a reason behind their point of view. Try not to be sensitive if someone points out a flaw in your logic. This is a great chance to learn something new.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
