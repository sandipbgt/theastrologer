Even if nothing particularly exciting is happening around you, you're just more engaged with the world. Your mind is moving ahead at a fast clip. Your creativity is stimulated. You're doing and saying things that are just a little bit outrageous -- and delightfully so. Have fun with this influence!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
