Do your best to stick to your agenda, especially if you're at work. Your boss may have higher standards right now than usual. Skimming over details won't work out well. You could miss something important, which would necessitate going back and starting over.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
