    "horoscope": "You're used to being indecisive. It's hard to make a choice when you're second-guessing yourself about all the other options available! But today, you're more likely just to feel confused. You don't have to vacillate on an issue, though. Buy some time and keep mulling things over. Perhaps you're thinking too logically, and not allowing your instincts to guide you. Tune in to your feelings. They hold the answers you seek.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
