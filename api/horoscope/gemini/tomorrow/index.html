    "horoscope": "Idle chitchat isn't going to cut it today. Along with many other people, you want to delve deeply into subjects that matter -- issues that affect you personally and intensely. There is some tendency now to be drawn to dark subjects purely for their own sake. You might feel as if pain or danger is the only thing worth talking about. Avoid exploiting real situations and emotions just for a thrill.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
