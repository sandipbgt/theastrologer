Make sure that you're saying exactly what you think you're saying, and that you're attending to all facets of a particular project. This is one of those days when the devil is in the details. If you let something minor slip past you, it'll probably turn out to be important! It's better just to be meticulous from the start, to avoid problems later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
