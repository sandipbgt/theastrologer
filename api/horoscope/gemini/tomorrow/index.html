    "horoscope": "You could go far today, physically or mentally. Whatever you do, set your heart on something meaningful and think big. This is a great time for brain exercise with a trip to the library or, better yet, an energetic debate with a well-informed friend. Be sure to listen well to their viewpoint, because it's easy to hear only what you want to hear. It's a good thing your exuberant energy draws people to your side, because you're in the mood for company. Take a good friend on a spontaneous trip someplace intriguing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
