    "horoscope": "A personal relationship could get intense today. Your inner passions are stirred up. Instead of being your usual witty self, you're brooding over something. This is so unlike you! But don't worry -- it will pass soon. You'll be able to laugh at how worked up you got over next to nothing. But for now, whatever you're feeling seems enormous and real, so feel it. Give yourself permission to be foolish and sentimental, if only for a day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
