On the contrary, it's sweating it that could be the issue now! It's easy to get stuck on something minor that really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Alternatively, you might face so many minor issues that you quickly become overwhelmed. Try to keep a sense of perspective!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
