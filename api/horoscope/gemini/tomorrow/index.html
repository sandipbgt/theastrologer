    "horoscope": "Sensual vibes are strong today, and you're feeling very aroused. You crave someone in an animal way, but don't jump into anything just yet. It would be far better not to for a bit of perspective, because this relationship could turn out to be a lot more complicated than you thought. It might even end up being the kind of connection you should avoid, but only time will tell. Taking things slowly feels frustrating now, but later, you'll be glad you did.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
