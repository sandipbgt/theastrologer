    "horoscope": "Be precise in your communication today. Don't assume the other person will understand your meaning if you give a skimpy explanation. Instead, be detailed and thorough as you describe exactly what you want. No matter who you're speaking to, give them all the information they might need. That way, you'll avoid snafus, and you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you attended to every possible detail.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
