    "horoscope": "Feelings you've been trying to ignore -- or maybe ones you didn't even realize you had -- come to the surface today. Instead of your usual witty, laugh-a-minute persona, now you're emotional and introspective. It's okay if you want to stay home and keep your own counsel, but do record your feelings in your blog or journal.
