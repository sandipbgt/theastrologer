    "horoscope": "You're actually starting to enjoy the mellow energy that's been slowing things down for the past couple of days. You aren't used to feeling this grounded, are you? It's easier than usual to do things that require sustained effort, like going for a long walk or jog, or tackling a tricky problem at work. You could get lost for hours today in a good book. Soak up this energy. Tomorrow, the pace picks up again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
