    "horoscope": "This could be an emotional day, and you aren't used to feeling moody. But you don't have to spend the day in a funk. Call a friend or meet up for good food and conversation. Reconnecting with someone you care about will help you feel grounded. And you're a natural at putting your feelings into words,. Try to listen as much as you talk, because your friend may need support, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
