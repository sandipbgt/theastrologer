You've always been good with words, and now feelings take center stage in some way. Talk things out. Just do your best to avoid intellectualizing your feelings, or someone else's. After all, not everything can be explained in rational terms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
