    "horoscope": "For once, you crave familiarity. This is a good time to stay home with the people you love best, or invite your friends over to share a home-cooked meal. What you're really doing is indulging in intimacy,-- something you may not often make time for. You're in the mood for it today, so enjoy it. Remind yourself how lucky you are to have such a loving and supportive home base.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
