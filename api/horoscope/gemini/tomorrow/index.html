    "horoscope": "You're in a resourceful mood today. You have the mental tools you need to deal with just about anything. You're able to judge each situation that arises on its own merits. Don't be surprised if you're more shy than usual. It's okay to withdraw from daily life sometimes -- especially if you're feeling a bit sensitive. It's a great day to hole up alone or with your family and take care of business.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
