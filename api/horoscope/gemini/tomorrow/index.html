    "horoscope": "You're able to express yourself with a lot of passion today. Your high energy makes you an interesting, vigorous conversationalist. Best of all, while others might get uptight when they sense their perspective being challenged, you'll stay good-humored regardless. You don't mind differences of opinion. That's what makes life colorful! If someone else's self-expression gets a little theatrical, you'll just sit back and enjoy the show.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
