    "horoscope": "Today is for expanding your horizons. Explore your neighborhood, city, or even your library. Read the newspaper cover to cover, and then discuss with a friend which parts you agreed or disagreed with. That's one good way to cooperate with the world instead of struggling against it, which is what you usually do. For now, though, just work within it, and ask your many questions. Above all, keep your eyes and heart open. You may not know what you're searching for until it shows up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
