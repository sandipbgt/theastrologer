    "horoscope": "Everyone around you seems to be in a very intense mood today. The way you see it, people are taking their feelings waaay too seriously. Why can't everyone just calm down and develop a sense of humor? You may be right about that. Being able to laugh at yourself is one of your best qualities,. But it's also okay to feel your emotions deeply. You don't always have to intellectualize everything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
