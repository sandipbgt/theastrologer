    "horoscope": "Today, you're a quick study with a passive outlook. You're willing to wait until all the facts are in. Until then, you'll divert your attention by talking with your friends or taking in a movie. Perhaps you'll reading a thriller or a book of poetry. Today isn't about getting a lot accomplished or moving in wide, important circles. Instead, take small steps and and enjoy the downtime. With any luck, any major opportunities will be waiting for you when your energy gets revved up again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
