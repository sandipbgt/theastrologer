    "horoscope": "Creativity and quick wits merge, heightening your imagination and drawing out your artistic side today. The good news is, you're not some snooty artist. Instead, you're open and talkative about your methods, happy to answer anyone's questions in an open and friendly way. Others' curiosity matches your own, so you understand where they're coming from. And if you open up a discussion about creative projects, you could actually learn a thing or two from someone else with different experience. A new opportunity presents itself, merging your fields of mutual interest. It's getting good now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
