You're feeling things a little more personally now, which makes it easy to relate to friends who ask you for advice. Normally, you might listen to their problem and give a quick answer. But now, you really listen with your heart. Answers may not come quite so quickly and easily, but they're heartfelt, and that counts for a lot.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
