    "horoscope": "You're usually quite lighthearted, but today feels different. Whether or not you're aware of it, something is eating you up inside, and beneath your charm lies some very real bitterness. Maybe it's time to acknowledge the mistakes you and others have made, and forgive everyone, including -- or perhaps most of all -- yourself. You'll feel better, and that sense of bitterness will wash away, making room for a more serene mindset.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
