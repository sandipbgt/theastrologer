    "horoscope": "Today should be all about fun, even if you have to spend the day at the office. You aren't really in work mode. You're much more likely to be found chatting with your coworker in the break room or sending witty text messages to make your friends laugh. Be sure to do what you need to do, but beyond that, enjoy yourself. It's important to indulge in a pleasurable, sunny mood like this one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
