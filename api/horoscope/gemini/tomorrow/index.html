If something is troubling you, the only way to deal with it is to process it -- think it through, talk it out, and be honest with yourself and anyone else involved. Don't avoid a tough situation or intellectualize your feelings  -- that can only work for so long. You have to start this process sometime.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
