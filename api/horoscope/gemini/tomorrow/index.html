    "horoscope": "Hey, look alive. Put a little magic in your moves. Pay attention and holler back like you care. Because, of course, you care a lot. In fact, the smartest thing you could do is broadcast your intentions today. Once other people understand what you're all about, they'll find ways to get your energy mixed up in their business. Clearly your professional and social lives could take off from here. Try to have as many different experiences as you can. Having them all at once would be especially cool, since you can actually handle the variety now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
