    "horoscope": "This should be a fun and active day. Get together with friends or call someone long-distance to enjoy a lively conversation. You can also tap into your creative side, if you're so inclined. Spend some time writing a poem or a short story, or drawing a picture. See what clever ideas you come up with when you let your mind wander. You'll probably end up making yourself laugh with delight!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
