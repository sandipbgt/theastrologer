    "horoscope": "Your creativity is an inspiration to others today. Your friends and coworkers only wish they could be as witty as you are! You draw a crowd almost effortlessly, just by telling the stories and jokes that come naturally to you. This festive mood makes work more fun, and it certainly brightens the time you spend with your family. Being around children is a great idea now, since you're so young at heart yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
