Don't be so petty and old-fashioned. Don't keep enforcing rules that no one cares about any more. You really hate it when others get that way. Maybe you always said things would be different if you ran the circus. Well, guess what. Now it's your turn. Instead of talking down to your equals, live up to your potential.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
