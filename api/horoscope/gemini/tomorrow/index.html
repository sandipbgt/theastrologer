    "horoscope": "You're like a fine wine with a complex character and exquisite taste. You're like the perfectly ripened cheese. You're fresh and hot as just-baked bread. Hey, are you hungry yet? Because right now would be a totally appropriate moment to sit down for good food with good friends. It doesn't matter if there's something else on the schedule. Even if this is a job interview or a first date, you'll all have a fine time. Friendly relations are sure to thrive today. It's only natural that your natural goodness will shine through.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
