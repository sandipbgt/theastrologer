    "horoscope": "Your focus isn't at its peak today. Neither is your eye for detail, though that's normally one of your defining characteristics. Now details merge like an impressionist painting. You might perceive vague images or sensations, but their edges are out of focus. Conversations feel like waking up and trying to remember a dream: The emotion is there, but the specifics evade you. In this mood, you just have to go with the flow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
