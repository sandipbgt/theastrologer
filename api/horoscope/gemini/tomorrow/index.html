    "horoscope": "Try not to overdo it today. You're feeling extra passionate, and some attractive person, sumptuous delicacy, or high-priced gadget might seem irresistible, no matter the financial or emotional cost. But any excesses you indulge in now will only end up making you feel nervous, if not downright guilty -- not to mention financially strapped. The key to resisting temptation is to focus on what you know is right, instead of giving in to what seems momentarily appealing.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
