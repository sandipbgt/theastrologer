    "horoscope": "Radical new theories seem especially appealing today. It's as if your mind has just cracked open and the sunlight is streaming in. And it's wonderful that you're so open-minded and progressive. Just make sure these ideas you're tossing around are actually feasible. Take this opportunity to bounce ideas off a friend or colleague -- someone who can tell you honestly whether you're on to something or completely off base.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
