But while you're in the midst of a blue, reflective mood, why not use it for what it's worth? Maybe there's a problem you haven't addressed yet, or unresolved feelings about an old relationship. The sooner you confront these issues, the sooner they'll dissolve forever.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
