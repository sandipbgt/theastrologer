    "horoscope": "When someone offers advice today, instead of taking it seriously, you just toss out a quick response and turn your back. Where's your team spirit? More to the point, where's this sudden insecurity coming from? It's likely that others are actually offering valuable input. And if they're displeased with something you've done, it might be well-deserved. Try to be humble, and take suggestions and complaints seriously. There's always room for improvement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
