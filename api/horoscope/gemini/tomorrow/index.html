    "horoscope": "Life could get a little heavy today. An intimate relationship may start to feel restrictive; even a business partnership could get intense. If you sense your partner becoming possessive of your time, try not to react in anger. That will only make things worse. It's important to find mature, gentle ways to create balance between togetherness and independence. Be creative, and keep your sense of humor about you. That will certainly help.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
