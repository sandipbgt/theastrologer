    "horoscope": "Your energy and creativity are on high today. You're making intellectual connections like an expert, and if you're part of a brainstorming group, your contributions will get others' ideas sparking. Teamwork is definitely the way to go today. You're in a great, playful mood, so it's easy to keep the peace. And there's a great deal of kinetic energy to be tapped into when you're working closely with other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
