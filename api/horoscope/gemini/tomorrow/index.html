    "horoscope": "Things that seem clear to you in the morning become a fog by the afternoon. What can you do with this situation? First, get your mental work done early in the day. Any bills you have to pay, letters to write or phone calls to make should come before lunch. That will leave the second half of the day for other activities that aren't quite so mentally demanding. You've got plenty of those.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
