A thorough, methodical approach to your activities is a much better idea. Pay attention to your resources, especially time and energy. That way you won't overextend yourself. Remember, your client or employer will love it if you come in under budget!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
