    "horoscope": "Today, you're truly a free spirit. You can feel your consciousness soar, along with your mood and energy levels. Join forces with other like-minded people who are interested in the same things you are. Humanitarian causes are especially good now -- projects aimed at improving the welfare of others. You can cover a lot of ground by letting fresh ideas feed off each other.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
