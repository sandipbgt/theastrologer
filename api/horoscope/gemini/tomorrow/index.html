    "horoscope": "Some people are highly emotional, but you've always been more an intellectual type. You tend to filter your feelings through your thoughts and perceptions, and you prefer not to wallow in emotion. Today, though, life enters a decidedly subjective realm, and it's smart to accept that instead of working against it. For starters, be compassionate when someone speaks of emotional issues. Instead of offering advice or tough love, try offering simple, kind support.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
