    "horoscope": "Being an expert is like being prejudiced. One set of facts could blind you to other possibilities. In other words, it's time to lose the opinions if you want to be remembered as a positive influence. Objective authority is best. Don't put your personal preferences ahead of the greater good. And now for the really big challenge, don't let friendships or loyalties stop you from doing the right thing. Sure, you can deny yourself, but can you deny them? If you're lucky, it may not come to this today. Help everyone understand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
