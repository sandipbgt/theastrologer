    "horoscope": "Sometimes you're into stirring up trouble purely for its own sake, but today you're in the mood for some good, old-fashioned harmony. That should be easy: Just gather your favorite people together, turn on some music and start the good times rolling. This is a great day for a potluck dinner or a dance party. Or, just let the festivities develop organically. Your good mood will help everyone loosen up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
