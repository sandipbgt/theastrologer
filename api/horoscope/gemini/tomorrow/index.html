    "horoscope": "You're unusually emotional today. You might find yourself lost in a reverie about someone from your past, or someone's sad story might really pull at your heartstrings. This kind of sentimental feeling isn't your usual state, and you might try to ignore it or display bravado you don't actually feel. Why not indulge in a bit of emotional vulnerability? If nothing else, it enables you to make sweet connections with other people.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
