    "horoscope": "Today's emotional intensity could be difficult for you to deal with. You try to keep conversations light and fun, but other people keep taking them to deep, dark places. And before you know it, your own worries and insecurities are stirred up -- and you'd rather not have to deal with them! If old wounds are reopened now, maybe it's actually a good thing. At least it gives you another opportunity to process your feelings.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
