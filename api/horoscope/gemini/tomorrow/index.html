Sure, this type of work can be tedious. Still, these jobs are important, and they need doing from time to time. And there's no time like the present. Get something accomplished now, and clear the decks for something new and exciting in the near future.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
