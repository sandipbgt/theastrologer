    "horoscope": "Today, your best bet is just to put your head down and get to work. Any attempts to avoid your responsibilities or sweet-talk your way out of them won't work -- and that's a good thing. This is your chance to show that you can back up a good line with solid effort. Your output can be really impressive, if you just focus and throw your back into it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
