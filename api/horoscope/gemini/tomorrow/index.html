    "horoscope": "It's a good day to talk about personal feelings and issues you may not normally address. You may be the type to rationalize your emotions away, because it's easier than feeling them in all their irrational glory. But avoid trying to ignore or intellectualize them now. Go ahead and dig into them -- the dark parts of your own soul. Put them into words, either in conversation or in a blog or journal entry.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
