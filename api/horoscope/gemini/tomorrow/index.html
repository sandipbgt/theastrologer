    "horoscope": "Let your thoughts and ideas roll today. Your mind is racing anyway, and your energy is high. You're tuned in to everything that's happening around you. You're the first person to get a joke or solve a puzzle. You grasp new concepts quickly and easily, so if you're taking a class or teaching yourself a new subject, you could take several strides forward now. Enjoy all this mental activity!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
