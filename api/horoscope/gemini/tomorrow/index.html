    "horoscope": "It's OK to aspire. It's OK to set your heart on something and work out all thein advance. You deserve good things and personal greatness as much as anyone. Just use diplomacy to get where you're going. Others may already be on edge for reasons that have nothing to do with you. Don't go rolling over them now. Because if you don't push them over that edge, they might turn around and come after you. This sounds pretty hostile. So instead of starting trouble along the way, use your good will to get you where you're going.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
