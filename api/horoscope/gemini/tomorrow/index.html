    "horoscope": "Your usually fast-paced mind slows down today, as your thoughts turn reflective. Usually you live firmly in the present, but now the past is calling out to you. Maybe an old friend calls or sends you an email. Or maybe a dream you had last night reminded you of something you'd forgotten. You might be lost in thought today, and that's not a bad thing. Sometimes it's nice to slow down and gain some perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
