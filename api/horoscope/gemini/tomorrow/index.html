    "horoscope": "Life offers up one inspiring moment after another today. Or maybe it's just that your mind is even sharper than usual. Complex systems and startling creativity hold equal fascination for you now. If you're working on a project, you could get happily lost in it for hours. Teamwork is even better today than solo efforts, so gather a group and go for it. Bouncing ideas off other people can be so productive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
