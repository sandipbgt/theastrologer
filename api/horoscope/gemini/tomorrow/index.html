It's as if you can't be bothered with trudging down that same old road again. You're going off the beaten track even if you already know that won't get you there any faster. Well, it's a style, if you want to call it that, but not everyone will face the same challenges this way. Be ready for a day of compromise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
