    "horoscope": "You're embroiled in a passionate quarrel, tossing out clever cut-downs and searing rebuttals -- but at this point, you don't even remember who started the whole thing. The reason behind the argument escapes you, which should be a pretty good sign that it's time to move on. Start looking for common ground, because it's not worth the discomfort of staying mired in the mess. You'll feel so much better when you can breathe easily again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
