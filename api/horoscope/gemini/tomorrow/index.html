    "horoscope": "Today, life seems especially exciting -- delicious, even. So tasty, you just want to gobble it up! It's great day to seek out new experiences, especially if you share them with friends. You're definitely in the mood for social activity, so don't turn down a date or party invitation. Of course, with your sense of humor, you can turn even the dullest of business meetings into a fun time for everyone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
