    "horoscope": "You have your fixed security needs, and they go way back, possibly to childhood. Maybe it's some early defense against fear or loneliness still at work, at least temporarily. But even as you move to resolve this thing yet again, trying to get it right for the hundredth time, you'll also need to adapt to some present day situation. It's not as hard as you think, especially if you don't rush into this change. Maturity and flexibility will come to you soon. Be in a good place when they find you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
