No matter what you're up to, it seems like there are a million small details clamoring for your attention, and you could feel overwhelmed trying to attend to all of them. If you find yourself moving at warp speed but accomplishing very little, slow down. You'll find that life moves forward at a steady pace, even if you take a breather.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
