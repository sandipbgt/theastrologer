    "horoscope": "Let yourself be romantic or affectionate today. It isn't sappy to let your loved ones know how you feel about them. And giving your nurturing support to someone is just being a good friend. Go ahead and show your concern, and avoid minimizing it. Heart-to-heart connections are highlighted right now, and the sooner you give in to this influence, the sooner you'll start to appreciate and enjoy its effects.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
