    "horoscope": "On a normal day, being sentimental isn't really your thing. But today is different. You're more emotional than usual, and perhaps more sensitive. You may find yourself swamped with nostalgia as old memories assail you. You might tear up at the silliest things, as life itself tugs at your heart strings. Don't resist this sudden sensitivity, or explain it away! Just go with it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
