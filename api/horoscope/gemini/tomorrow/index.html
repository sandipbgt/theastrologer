You're as curious as ever, but more accepting than usual. Just try not to be completely gullible. There are people out there who might think like enemies, and you still need to show your superiors you can't be fooled. But when no one's looking, there's nothing wrong with indulging in a little wide-eyed wonderment. The world's an incredible place, after all.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
