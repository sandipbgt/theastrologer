And if you try to go whipping through the day at your normal pace, you may find yourself in one mishap after another. It's better to move slowly and not to push yourself if you aren't feeling energetic. It's okay to take a little downtime, you know. Go easy on yourself, Gemini.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
