    "horoscope": "Don't fool yourself: Flippant remarks can't hide efforts to belittle yourself, at least not for long. Even more importantly, putting yourself down can only make you feel worse, so stop it. Be kind to yourself. You deserve it. Your friends and loved ones would agree. In fact, maybe you should rely on them for a little comfort and support today. Don't start focusing that critical eye on them, though.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
