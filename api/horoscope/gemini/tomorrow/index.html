    "horoscope": "Your usual witticisms are likely to fall on deaf ears today, and people may look askance if you're silly or playful. There's a focused attitude now, so tap into it if you can. Or at least pretend! Work quietly at the office, or tackle a cleaning or organizational project at home. Get something accomplished and cross it off your task list. At the very least, this will create a welcome sense of achievement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
