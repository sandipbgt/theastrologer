    "horoscope": "Forget about your dignity today. It doesn't matter who's watching or what they might say. Let your frisky side take over. Let your inner puppy or kitten come romping out that open door. Roll in the grass, the surf or the hay if it so pleases you. Flirt with an attractive stranger if it feels appropriate. It's all in fun, and it doesn't have to disrupt your organized life in any long-term way. Of course, if you wanted that kind of disruption, this would certainly be your moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
