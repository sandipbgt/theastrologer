    "horoscope": "Being spontaneous is one of your most appealing qualities. But today, you're downright impulsive. Excitement makes you bold, and risks don't bother you. In fact, they just add to the adventure of your day. You certainly know how to think on your feet, and that's a good thing. You can bounce back quickly from any missteps, too. But just a bit of forethought and planning can greatly improve the flow of your day.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
