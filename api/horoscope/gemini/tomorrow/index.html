    "horoscope": "Whoever said courtly behavior is a thing of the past never met you. Today you're bringing back chivalry in its finest form: humor. You're feeling civilized and upbeat, and you'll bring that energy wherever you go. Your jokes are genteel and family friendly, which means you'll be a star in any gathering. If you're pushing forward on a particular project, this is the perfect time to network and bring support to your corner. Or, just have a great time chatting people up and bringing smiles to their faces.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
