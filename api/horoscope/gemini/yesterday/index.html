That normally keen mind of yours may feel foggy, making it hard to make firm decisions. This could be a good day to take it easy, both mentally and physically. Sleep late, take a midday nap or get to bed early tonight. Lose yourself in a great book or movie.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
