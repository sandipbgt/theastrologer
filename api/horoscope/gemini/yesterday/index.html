    "horoscope": "Take casual pride in your work instead of crowing about it like a rooster. You don't actually need praise from other people, because you already know it's true, and doesn't that feel good? There's no need to strut and swagger here at ground level when you can just spread your wings and take to the sky, which is your true element anyhow. So what kind of airborne creature would you be? A bat? A superhero? An angel? However you see yourself, be an individual today, and you'll reap the rewards tomorrow.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
