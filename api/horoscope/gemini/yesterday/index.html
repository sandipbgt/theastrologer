    "horoscope": "Once upon a time, someone led the way by breaking with tradition. Maybe you're dreaming about staging your own revolt as soon as conditions are right. Although you may let your friends go first, just to see if it's safe. Nonconformity will probably feel like an empty gesture if you're doing it because everyone else is. These symbolic acts waste time and resources. They also divert people's attention from more important things. Make yourself useful today. Seek fulfillment instead of continuing to live in a vacuum.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
