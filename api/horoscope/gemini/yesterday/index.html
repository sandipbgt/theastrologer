    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if a shy mood sets in today. Who -- you, shy? No way! And yet, it happens sometimes. Especially on days like today, when you're focused and your energy is calm. You can get a lot accomplished in this state of mind, so take advantage of the opportunity. And play as hard as you work. A sincere effort at the office or the gym deserves some solid relaxation at home.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
