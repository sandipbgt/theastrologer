    "horoscope": "You have a taste in your mouth for some fun that's well outside your normal group of friends or scope of experience. It's good to test your boundaries, but remember the mantra, 'Everything in moderation.' You don't have the most objective view of yourself right now, which means you could get into trouble before you realize what's happening. In fact, bring a trusted friend with you, someone who can act as a voice of reason if things start getting out of hand.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
