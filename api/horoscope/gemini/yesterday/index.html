Maybe you're actually masking feelings of inferiority, because you're certainly in a bit of a tizzy. The thing is, nothing has changed, except your perception of yourself and where you stand. It'll shift again soon -- so while you're stuck in this mindset, don't place too much importance on any anxieties that crop up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
