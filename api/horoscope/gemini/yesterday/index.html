    "horoscope": "Like most people around you, your feelings are all stirred up today, and you're feeling vulnerable -- but unlike some, you really don't like this state of mind.

What messages is your subconscious mind trying to send you? Revel in your senses today, and welcome any impressions that arise.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
