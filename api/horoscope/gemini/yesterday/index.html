    "horoscope": "You're canny but not cool. It's probably because you know too much. And that disturbing or forbidden knowledge will make you uptight today, if you let it. Your imagination is all too ready to wander through the half-spoken world of other people's secrets. Maybe you're afraid those secrets are about you. Maybe you're jealous of missing a party where your presence wouldn't be required anyway. You'll get over this little anxiety hump once some quick decision gives you a push. Busy, fulfilled people don't have time to worry about stuff like that. They're just too cool.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
