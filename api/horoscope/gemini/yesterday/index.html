Instead of dwelling in a state of anxiety, why not do something proactive about the problem? Focus on strengthening anything related to your money or career. Hard work yields good results now. Move forward with purpose, so you can look back with pride.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
