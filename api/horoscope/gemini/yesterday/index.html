    "horoscope": "Finishing the simplest project feels historic. You can hardly believe it when you accomplish even the littlest thing! And that's just the way it should be -- today isn't about throwing your energy into a new project or ticking items off a mile-long to-do list. Rather, it's about being satisfied with whatever level of energy or accomplishment comes naturally. You'll find that meetings with friends or colleagues crackle with synergy. Big things are in the works -- they just won't blast off right this second. Breakthrough is still a few days away, but it's coming.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
