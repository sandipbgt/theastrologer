    "horoscope": "You might feel slightly discouraged today. Normally, it's easy for you to stay optimistic. But now, a combination of oversensitivity and low energy could have you feeling a bit down about things. If so, remind yourself that these feelings are just temporary, and they'll pass soon. Don't try to rationalize them away. It will be much better if you simply feel your way through them. Be gentle with yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
