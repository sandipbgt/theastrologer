    "horoscope": "Your emotions are all stirred up today. A vague sense of melancholy could well up within you. It's disorienting to experience feelings that you can't necessarily attach to events. For example, you might be swamped with a sense of worry or discouragement, even if everything in your life is moving along just fine. Do your best to feel your emotions, even as you strive to keep a sense of perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
