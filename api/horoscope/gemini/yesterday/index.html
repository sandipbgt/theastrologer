    "horoscope": "Stay in motion today. You've got the energy and willpower, and there are plenty of opportunities at your fingertips. All you have to do is grab them. Your actions are speaking volumes, but don't forget the importance of coherence, too. Good thing you're naturally silver-tongued! If you have to explain, you'll do it with a friendly vibe that naturally draws allies. These helpful friends can assist in your success, so let them know how appreciative you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
