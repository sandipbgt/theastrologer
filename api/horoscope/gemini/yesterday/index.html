    "horoscope": "Life feels complicated today. Relationships could be bogged down in sticky, tricky emotional issues, or maybe your worries are purely internal. Either way, it's hard to see how you'll ever work through it all to the light, happy place you prefer. But you most certainly will -- you can count on that. Honesty with yourself is a good place to start. Once you can name your own emotions, you can work on understanding them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
