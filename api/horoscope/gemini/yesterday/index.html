    "horoscope": "Life could get a little emotional today. Don't be surprised if your interactions with other people lead to feelings or situations that can't be explained away with logic. That's the nature of emotions: They aren't rational. They just are. So deal with them on that level. Don't try to intellectualize your own feelings or someone else's. Simply face them and feel them. You'll find that they recede more quickly that way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
