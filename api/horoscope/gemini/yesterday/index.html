Today is all about improvement and enlargement. Maybe it's your mission to leave a bigger footprint in the landscape, but there will almost certainly be consequences for this. These could happen in the natural world or in your community. Watch out for conflict. Some people might see your expansion as provocation. Be tolerant of their boundaries, even if your way is obviously better. If they don't agree, go around them instead of through them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
