    "horoscope": "Stop running the numbers in your head long enough to start looking at all the human variables. Do you even know who your neighbors are, or what they're likely to do? Adjust your sights today. Instead of imagining what could be, look at what actually is. Being aware doesn't mean you have to commit. You can still lead a carefree life instead of locking into something unsatisfactory. As long as you know exactly what you're avoiding, you'll find a way of dealing with what comes next.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
