    "horoscope": "You have more focus and stamina than usual today. This could end up making you restless since you aren't used to feeling so stable! But you won't notice the passage of time if you put this calm, steady flow of energy to good use. Finish up a project at work, or revisit your budget. Now, you're probably thinking, 'Budget? What's that?' But today's energy is perfect for reviewing your income and expenses, and making sure you're living within your means.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
