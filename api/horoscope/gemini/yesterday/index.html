Then there'd be a mess to clean up, including hurt feelings., you're better off being casual, even if you're craving formality or intensity. It's entirely possible that today, you'll be sad that things didn't turn out differently. But the truth is, it simply isn't worth the fight. Take a step back and let things go.
