    "horoscope": "Abstract thinking comes easily when you have a firm grip on the basics. Instead of saying 'what,' say 'what if.'

This is no way to run a life, although you might keep the suspense going for a month if luck stays on your side. Still, listen to advice from people who've already been there. You don't have to repeat every single mistake they made.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
