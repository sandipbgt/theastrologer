Tune into this today, and you may discover that, for the first time in ages, you're sure of yourself. You know who you are and what your purpose is. Don't waste the moment. Put this power into your words and actions. Change your behavior if you really need to convince others that you're serious. And you'll get extra points if you can keep a smile on your face for a whole month.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
