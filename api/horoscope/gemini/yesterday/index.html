It's more than just a sunny disposition, too, although there won't be any dark clouds on the horizon for quite a while. This kind of beauty is more than skin deep. It warms to the core. Let your happy intelligence shine out today. Make them all see the light. Because when you put it that way, they'll believe anything you tell them. And as long as you mean what you say, your conscience will be clear.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
