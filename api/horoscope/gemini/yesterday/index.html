    "horoscope": "Suddenly you're even more outspoken and humorous than usual. You'll shine at dinner parties, business meetings and even the grocery store. Expect all eyes on you -- which is just fine with you, at least for now! You like the attention, and especially the admiration. If you're single, this is a great time for connecting with someone cute and interesting. And if there's someone who doesn't seem to see your talents just yet, don't worry. Soon, you'll show 'em.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
