They've seen you in love, in trouble and sometimes even before you've had your coffee in the morning. Whether or not they know you well, they probably like you and can certainly help you. Today you'll be a big fish in a small pond. Maybe that sounds impossible, but the more excited you get, the harder you'll work, and that's where the magic and surprise start kicking in.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
