    "horoscope": "You have little patience today for the sober mood that seems to be affecting everyone. Buckling down to work is no fun when you can't make social calls or listen to music, and something about today's energy just feels heavy. But maybe that's a sign that you should concentrate on your responsibilities. After all, not every day can be packed with fun, and you have to take care of business sometime.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
