It'll probably be a little more difficult than you think. If not, no big deal. This mood will pass soon, at which point you can get back to your usual self. In the meantime, keep an eye out for bright spots. If anyone can find them, it's you. You've always had a keen eye for hilarity and illumination.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
