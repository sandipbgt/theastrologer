This offers you yet another good way to manifest your preferred reality, so grab hold of any opportunities that arise now. They'll come quickly and easily -- you might not even recognize them for the lucky chances they are. As long as you don't get too sure of yourself, you should come out distinctly ahead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
