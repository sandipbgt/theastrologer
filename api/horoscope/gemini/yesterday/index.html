Don't spend time on your own if you don't have to. Getting together with other people is favored now. You want to mix and mingle, to trade stories, ideas and pleasantries. Even if your agenda is one business meeting after another, you can still make time for banter.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
