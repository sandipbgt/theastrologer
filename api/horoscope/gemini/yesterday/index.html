    "horoscope": "If you're presenting an idea or proposal to an audience today, use your natural intelligence and wit to draw people's interest, but be sure to employ charm and grace, too. Others want to feel comfortable with you as a person as well as confident in your abilities, so let them know you're the perfect candidate for the job, loan or project by being on your best behavior. Good fortune will do the rest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
