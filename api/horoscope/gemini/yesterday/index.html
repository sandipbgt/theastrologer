    "horoscope": "Many people feel emotionally vulnerable today, and this could include you. Life may seem a little uncomfortable at the moment. This is especially true if you lose focus on an important project you've been working on. It's only temporary. Try not to be too discouraged if you have to postpone progress on this dream. You're creative enough to improve upon it during this brief downtime.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
