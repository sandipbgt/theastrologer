    "horoscope": "Thinking instead of doing -- now, that's something you shouldn't find to be much of a hardship. Today, you'll enter a cerebral space. This may be contrary to your usual energy levels, but wild activity and a full schedule wouldn't be realistic right now. Today is far better suited for sitting back and finding solutions to a problem or analyzing a situation, and giving it your full brain power. Since you're intellectual by nature, it's easy for you to get into this. You know you can think now and act later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
