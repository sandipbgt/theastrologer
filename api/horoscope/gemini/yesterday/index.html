    "horoscope": "Sometimes you fit in a little too well. Don't be such a chameleon. Step out of their blind spot and identify yourself today. You don't belong in the background. Let your style and grace do the talking. And even if you chose not to draw people's focus by projecting superficial things, your experience alone would validate you as somebody who's worth taking seriously. During the next month, get into the habit of marching up to the table and claiming what should be yours. It'll be easy once you realize that nobody's going to argue about it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
