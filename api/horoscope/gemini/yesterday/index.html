    "horoscope": "Today, your imagination is incredibly active. You might notice this as soon as you wake up, as strange, vivid dreams continue to play through your mind. It might even be difficult to tell whether they were truly dreams or memories! This is simply the kind of day when the veil between reality and fantasy thins. Don't try to make logical sense of your impressions. Just let them come.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
