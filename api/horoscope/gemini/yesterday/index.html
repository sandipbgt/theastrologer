Tackle the projects you've been putting off because they seem too boring. The time is right. You might even be able to sink into them and forget the passing of time as you work! Remember, there's no need to reinvent the wheel. Whatever you're up to, a simple, straightforward approach works best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
