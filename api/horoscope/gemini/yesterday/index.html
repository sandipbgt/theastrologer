    "horoscope": "It's a great day to learn something new. Open your mind to concepts you hadn't considered before. Explore fresh realms of inquiry. Mental flexibility is one of your strengths, so this should be enjoyable for you. Your only difficulty might be getting the big-picture perspective that's so important right now. Don't allow yourself to get caught up in minor details that don't matter in the grand scheme of things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
