    "horoscope": "You have a gift with words, and today is the time to use it. Express your appreciation eloquently. Your friends will enjoy a well-worded toast over their dinner table. Your employer will appreciate the way you speak both kindly and candidly to a new client. Well-chosen language allows you to give freely and endlessly, you know. It's one of the few gifts that costs you nothing, yet can make an enormous difference in other people's lives. So don't be stingy! Treat people to your best language and back it up with meaning.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
