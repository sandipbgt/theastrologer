    "horoscope": "You're generally cooperative with others. But now you're going beyond simple cooperation into pure entertainment. Today you'll put smiles on everyone's faces. You're in full command of your sense of humor. It's no effort to make people laugh. In fact, it's a pleasure. Maybe you can use this turned-on, tuned-in energy to bring people into your corner on some important project. Or, just use it for some fun and good times. You're the center of the party, so it's up to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
