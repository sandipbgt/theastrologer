    "horoscope": "You're flip-flopping between meek, submissive behavior and blasts of crazy energy today. What's going on? Whatever it is, try not to be irritating. Even more importantly, don't let anxiety affect your health. Whatever you're worried about, it's not worth high blood pressure, interrupted sleep, or even the scattered focus and general insecurity you have now. The good news is, you'll calm down soon. In the meantime, use deep-breathing techniques and exercise to blow off steam.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
