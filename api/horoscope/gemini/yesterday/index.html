Networking goes well now, because you're making connections right and left. It's easy to make a good impression. You have a way with words that keeps people intrigued. You can even have someone who's normally a quiet type laughing and chatting within minutes!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
