These people may need some extra attention now, and you're in the mood to give it. Their company is both enjoyable and soothing for you. You're extra aware of what they mean to you, and how they make your life better. Show them a little appreciation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
