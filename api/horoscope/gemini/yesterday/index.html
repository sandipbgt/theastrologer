    "horoscope": "It feels good to be generous with others today. And hey, if you get some extra appreciation for your efforts, that's even better. But you aren't being magnanimous just for the props. You're simply in a good mood, and you want to bring that sunny warmth to others. So reach out, especially to people who seem lonely or down in the dumps. That's a wonderful, simple way to make the world a better place.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
