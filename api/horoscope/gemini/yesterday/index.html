Don't worry about how prepared you may or may not be. You have all the knowledge and dexterity you'll need for today, if not longer. Looking good wouldn't hurt, either. That part should be easy for you,. Your sense of self is strong and healthy enough that you can touch up your appearance without feeling vain or attention-starved. All you need is a smile.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
