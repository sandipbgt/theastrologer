    "horoscope": "You're normally so open-minded, but today you might get stuck in one, fixed perspective. Or perhaps someone around you is the one who's being obstinate, so you're just playing devil's advocate in response. Either way, a narrow perspective is limiting now. You might easily head down the wrong mental path. But if that happens, it's okay. Unraveling mistaken logic helps you work your way back to true understanding.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
