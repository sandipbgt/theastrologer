    "horoscope": "Go ahead and cry today if you need to. Or laugh, even if nothing is really that funny. Or spend the day alone, reading a fantasy novel or writing poetry in your journal. It's up to you how you tap into the current energy, but one thing is certain: You'll feel much better if you welcome your emotions -- even the gooey, tricky, confusing ones. Take joy in the fact that you're a person of surprising emotional depth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
