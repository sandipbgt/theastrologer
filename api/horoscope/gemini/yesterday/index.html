But don't spend time with unreliable people purely for the sake of connection. Being all by yourself is okay, too, you know, especially, if you take the opportunity to get some work done or make plans for your future. Any downcast mood will pass soon, and you'll feel much more optimistic again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
