And while you may not think of yourself as an emotional person, you may actually be prone to ups and downs. If feelings of nervousness, sadness or sentimentality settle in, there's no need to ignore them or rationalize them away. Just feel them, and they'll pass through very quickly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
