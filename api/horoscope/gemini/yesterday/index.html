    "horoscope": "You're starting to realize that the sibling rivalry dynamic you've got going with someone isn't working anymore. In fact, it's outmoded, and more than a little boring. Focus on what you have in common with this person. This will open some doors. Just think how much you could accomplish if you worked with them instead of wasting time tossing jabs back and forth. Be the bigger person by building a bridge between you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
