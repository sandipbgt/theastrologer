    "horoscope": "Be realistic about your limits. You like to talk, and sometimes you even like to embellish your abilities or accomplishments. Be wary about talking big if you can't live up to it! The current cosmic energy is highly realistic in nature, and it emphasizes rules, boundaries and limitations. Work within these parameters and you'll be just fine. It's when you start to test them that things could go awry.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
