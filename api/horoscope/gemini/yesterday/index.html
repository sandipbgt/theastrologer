But this isn't the time to stir up trouble,, however harmless you might think it is. The people you're dealing with require a more thoughtful approach. That shouldn't be too hard for you -- you're cerebral by nature. Put your sharp mind to use and mind your manners. It won't kill you, and just might end up saving your skin.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
