    "horoscope": "Life takes a deeply emotional turn today. Will you ride that wave or resist its pull? You tend to shy away from intense feelings by intellectualizing them. Talking about your emotions is an important skill to develop, but not at the expense of actually feeling them. Only through experiencing them can you process them, and then move on. Focus today on feeling your emotions rather than trying to explain them away.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
