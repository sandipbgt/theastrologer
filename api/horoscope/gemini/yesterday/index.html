You tend to skim the surface of the things you learn about, because you're more interested in variety of knowledge than depth. But today is a great time to really dig into something. Do your research, and analyze the details. Get absorbed in the subject.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
