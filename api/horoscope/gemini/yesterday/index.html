But don't let this make you snappish with others. If someone offers you help, accept or decline graciously. Maybe you want to work solo so you can reap all the glory. But you'll realize that it's even more important to maintain good relations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
