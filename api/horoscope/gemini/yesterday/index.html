    "horoscope": "Focusing can be a real challenge for you, even when you know it's important. Today, try not to fidget. People respect you so much more if you stand still and don't squirm. Will they see through you? It's possible. Minor benefits may be all you can expect for today, but some days are just like that. Be grateful for the practice, and secure in the knowledge you'll know exactly what to do next time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
