    "horoscope": "Things do happen for a reason, but sometimes it can be hard to figure out what that reason is. Sometimes it feels as if it's you against the world. But while brooding about your so-called fate might be momentarily satisfying, it doesn't help you advance your cause, so don't waste time navel-gazing. Instead, mingle with other people and forget about your troubles for the moment. Maybe something good will come of this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
