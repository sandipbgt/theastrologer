    "horoscope": "You're avid but not obsessed. You're peppy but not obnoxious. Your enthusiasm is totally appropriate, which is a good thing because you have a lot of it right now, and it would spoil the fun if you had to stifle yourself just to respect someone else's delicate sensibilities. That's one less thing to worry about! Meanwhile, today will bring easy access to some of your favorite places, especially if you show up on time. Go with gusto. Let others lean on you if they wear out before you do. Don't be afraid to show them just how strong you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
