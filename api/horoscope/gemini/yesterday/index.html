That includes admitting your mistakes, as difficult as that is. You'll find, though, that once you start doing it, it gets a lot easier. This could be a learning curve, but you can handle it. Being humble and open to life's lessons still counts as doing your best.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
