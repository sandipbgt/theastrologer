    "horoscope": "Your attention is focused and refined today. Instead of heading off in every direction, like you usually do, you're able to zero in on details that you might otherwise overlook. And instead of excitedly telling everyone you know about your new discoveries, you keep the information to yourself. This allows it to mellow, giving your mind time to absorb it. Then you can carry it even further, once you truly understand its importance."
