Instead of being a divisive force, it's time to focus on bringing people together. Maybe you can draw on your sense of humor to get everyone laughing and talking. Or connect with your own passion, and use your silver tongue to whip up a frenzy of interest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
