    "horoscope": "Why are you so aimless and impractical? Whether you're spending too much or nothing at all, you're still fantasizing about things you can't afford. It's ruining your focus and discipline. Maybe all this wishing for an impossible life is undercutting your happiness, too. Yes, life might be hard, but don't expect much sympathy today. The people who know you best will be the first to tell you that you can do better than this. But you already knew that! So do something about it. Start spending your time and energy in all the right places.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
