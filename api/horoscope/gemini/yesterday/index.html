And your hands will be all over the place. It will probably seem as if you have more than two of them. So exactly how many things can you do at once? It's not just about making yourself useful, though. It's also about looking good while you do all this stuff. Keep that smile on your face and you'll be even easier on the eyes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
