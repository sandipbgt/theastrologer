    "horoscope": "Talk things out with a special someone, especially if there's been tension in your relationship. Inspect your own deep feelings and motivations. Of course, this process may not be very fun, easy or pleasant. Developing self-awareness is hard work! That's probably why you tend to shy away from emotional confrontations. But hang in there if one develops today. Ride it out as you talk it out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
