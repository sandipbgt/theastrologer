You're willing to test out new ideas and see how they play out. You can exhibit a lot of innovation in your work, impressing a client or supervisor. All of this adds up to big, bold brain waves that have the potential to play out in some surprising ways.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
