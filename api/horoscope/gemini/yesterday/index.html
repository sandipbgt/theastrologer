    "horoscope": "It's extra important to do your best today, because many people are in critical mindsets. It's not as easy as usual to get away with cutting corners. Normally you might be able to finesse your way through something, but not right now! What works best now is genuine focus and effort. Stay logical and attend to details -- but don't get caught up in them. Set a steady pace and stick to it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
