Your fingerprints are all over the situation, but don't worry about spilling the evidence or spreading your germs, because everybody wants this kind of contagious enthusiasm. Keep them laughing (as if you had a choice about that). It's all totally hilarious, but you've never been more serious. One way or another, you'll get your point across. Hold that thought, and you'll hold onto this glorious feeling, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
