    "horoscope": "It's easy today to get your feelings hurt. Normally, you're all about poking fun at people, and you have no trouble joining in when someone else is laughing at you. But now you're feeling much more sensitive. You don't want people making fun of you -- even benign, well-intended fun! Set your boundaries, but do try to keep your sense of humor. If someone hurts your feelings, they probably thought you'd get the joke.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
