It'll be harder than usual to fake sincerity if you're not feeling it. Flippant remarks might cut deeper than you intended. Try harder to stay in focus so that you can read the situation better. It's OK to let people know your current limitations, but you have to be kind about it. You'd expect the same courtesy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
