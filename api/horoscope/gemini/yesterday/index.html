    "horoscope": "If you feel untouchable it's only because they can't touch you. You're so far out front that they're just an annoying dust cloud in your rear view mirror. Your boundaries are more like zones than lines, meaning that nothing unwanted can penetrate because you'll see it coming from a long way off. So you get to ignore everyone else's artificial standards today. You know you're wonderful, and so will the right people. You'd let them touch you, right? Don't be shy once it's clear that you share the same idea of perfection.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
