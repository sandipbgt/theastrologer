    "horoscope": "Today, you're like a field mouse that's overly aware of the shadow of the hawk overhead: scared and expecting the worst. You may not be able to put your finger on exactly where this feeling originated. Don't attach too much importance to your worries. It's just your own inner fear. Try laughing and carrying on as if you're as calm and confident. A 'fake it till you make it' approach will work like a charm.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
