    "horoscope": "If you feel unusually calm today, that means it's a good time to take a day-long break from your usual frenetic pace. Instead of racing through your day, spend it quietly at work or at home. Sleep in and lounge around a little, if you can. Life is sweet in this steady state. Maybe you could even prolong it for a while. Breathe deeply and feel your feet on the ground. Be here now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
