And instead of excitedly telling everyone you know about your new discoveries, you keep the information to yourself. This allows it to mellow, giving your mind time to absorb it. Then you can carry it even further, once you truly understand its importance.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
