    "horoscope": "It's important to be responsible today. Live up to your responsibilities and honor others' expectations of you. This applies both at work and at home. A serious attitude may not be your style, but it's really the best way to get through a day like this. The emphasis now is on applying yourself to the task at hand, whatever that may be. Slacking off could be seen as unreliability.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
