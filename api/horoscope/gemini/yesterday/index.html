    "horoscope": "Caution and convention aren't really your thing, but today it's more important than usual to follow the rules. Now, that probably rubs you the wrong way!

Stick to your routine, focus on your work and remind yourself that life will lighten up soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
