Make this a social occasion as well as a physical one. Find a friend to join you in running, walking, biking or lifting weights, and chat as you go. That way, you'll be mentally stimulated as well as physically. Your overactive mind will thank you!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
