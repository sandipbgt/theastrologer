    "horoscope": "It's important to be productive today. You don't want to look back at the end of the day and realize you really didn't get anything accomplished.

Making a list or a plan helps keep you on track. Patterns can help with efficiency.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
