    "horoscope": "Today your creativity is snapping and sparking like a live wire. You're even more quick-witted than usual. Imaginative connections come fast and frequent, which is a lot of fun -- and it could turn out to be quite useful. You're able to understand problems and situations more quickly than other people. That gives you a leg up, whether you're at work, playing a game of logic or simply enjoying a conversation with a friend.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
