    "horoscope": "Well, you're a bit cheeky today, aren't you? You're teasing your coworkers or family members, making everyone laugh and have fun. Your sense of humor lifts even mundane activities above their usual level of tedium. At the very least, it's easy to distract yourself from any boredom that might set in. This upbeat mood may seem simple, but it's a true gift, one everyone around you appreciates.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
