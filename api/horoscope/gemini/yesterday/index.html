    "horoscope": "It's your lucky day. You're one of those gifted multi-taskers, doing it all with one hand behind your back. Clearly you're flaunting what you have. It seems that you're quite the flirt, too. Do you even know how attractive you are? It's important to understand what kind of splash you're going to make during a month when you could drive everyone crazy. Learning to laugh at yourself would be one way to defuse the bomb of lust and envy. Everyone else will have a better time and you'll have more fun, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
