    "horoscope": "Ordinarily, anything tried and true seems old and tired to you. You're attracted to things new and exciting, but today, don't shy away from tradition. Embrace it wholeheartedly. After all, you can't deny that there's a certain comfort to be gained from long-established, time-honored influences. And these create a foundation in your life -- that very support that allows you to push out into the world like the maverick you are.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
