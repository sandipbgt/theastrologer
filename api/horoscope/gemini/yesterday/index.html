    "horoscope": "Your mind wanders today. Concentration is nearly impossible, and ephemeral at best. The good news is, this strange, dreamy mood is also fleeting. All you can do is wait it out. In the meantime, try to enjoy the benefits of having an enhanced imagination! It's a great time to write a story or a poem, or to enjoy reading or watching movies. Let your mind go. It'll come back when it's ready.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
