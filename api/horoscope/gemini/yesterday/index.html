But try not to overdo it, because it's all too easy now to wear yourself out. On the other hand, exploring the world or staying home to have fun with your friends and family makes you feel wonderful. Just take it easy, and work in frequent breaks!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
