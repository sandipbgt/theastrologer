    "horoscope": "Normally you're a natural in a crowd, but today, you just can't seem to get into the conversation. To your ear, it's all just a lot of distant chatter. No one's making much sense, and they all seem to be talking around the point instead of focusing on what you think is important. Still, try to be polite. You can at least pretend to pay attention, can't you? Then, in a couple of days when you're feeling more yourself, you can seamlessly pick up where you left off, and no one will be the wiser.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
