Plus, taking care of business in your house or yard can be an excellent distraction for an hour or two. Focus on getting things comfortable for yourself and your family, and also on reinforcing or fixing anything that's currently weak or broken. Making repairs gives you an inner sense of calm and well being.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
