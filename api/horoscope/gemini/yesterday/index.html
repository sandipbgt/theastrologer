You'll just have to wait your turn, no matter how intense your sense of need might be. It's just not your time yet. Or maybe all this excess wanting has actually prevented you from being satisfied. Try focusing on what you have instead of what you lack.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
