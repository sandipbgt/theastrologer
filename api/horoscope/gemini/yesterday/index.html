    "horoscope": "It's a very good day for important face-to-face interactions. You're at your charming best -- witty, friendly and agreeable. You're willing to make concessions in the name of gaining something else that's more important to you. Others are sure to notice your gallant generosity. In a professional setting, this could lead to an excellent opportunity coming your way. Among friends, it will simply endear you to them -- which is equally important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
