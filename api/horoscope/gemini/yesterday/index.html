    "horoscope": "You should always be yourself, of course. But today, it's a good idea to watch how you're coming across in public, especially in professional situations or formal gatherings of any type. Be sensitive to the impression you're making on other people. If you tell a bawdy joke and no one laughs, it's a sign that you've stepped over a line! Be quiet and reserved now. Let others set the tone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
