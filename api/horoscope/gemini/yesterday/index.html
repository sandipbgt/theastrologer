Your world is your own, private amusement park, filled with exciting rides and delights around every corner. Best of all, you're flexible enough to change along with everything that's happening around you. Soon, you'll feel like a completely different person. You might even look back and chuckle at how naive you were when this all began!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
