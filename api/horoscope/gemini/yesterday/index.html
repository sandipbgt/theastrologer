    "horoscope": "If the pace of life slows down a little today, thank your lucky stars. You have to admit, things got pretty active for a day or two there! Now is your chance to relax and decompress. This should come as a relief. Everybody needs some downtime every now and again, even you. Be a little lazy. Enjoy your friends and family. Unwind, so you can wind back up again soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
