You're having a great time, and if anyone can learn from their missteps, it's you. In fact, a hasty approach to a generally madcap day might be your best bet. The universe currently favors those with the courage to push full-force ahead, regardless of the what-ifs. Use your head, and go with confidence.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
