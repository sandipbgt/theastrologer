    "horoscope": "Sometimes you're quick to anger, which is justified because there's a lot wrong in the world. But this time you're quick to smile, because it's also a beautiful place and, like you, many of these awesome people totally get it. Let your generous side triumph today as you share that joke and spread the good word. Invite this mood to stay longer. By now you probably understand that this feeling comes from the inside. Turn up the heat and keep having an effect. It's the best way. Maybe it's the only way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
