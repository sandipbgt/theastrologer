    "horoscope": "Today, you're blessed with a silver tongue. No matter what challenges or opportunities might arise, you can talk your way into -- or out of -- just about anything! This is truly a gift, and one that has its fair share of responsibility. Do your best to stay both honest and practical. Don't make promises you have no hope of keeping! And follow through on your stated intentions. Remember, your word is your bond.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
