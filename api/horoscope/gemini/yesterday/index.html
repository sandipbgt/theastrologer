    "horoscope": "Your energy is grounded today, leading to a sense of inner serenity. This may seem a little dull, but not every day can be fast-paced and active. Some days, like this one, are simply made for hard, honest work, connecting with loved ones, and getting some rest and relaxation. Being productive and tending to your basic needs -- food, shelter, companionship -- makes you feel solid from the inside out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
