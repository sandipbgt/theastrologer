    "horoscope": "Many people are in emotional mindsets today. But intense emotion can make you uncomfortable, so your instinct might be to laugh this off or intellectualize it. Minimizing your own feelings is one thing -- and be forewarned, it probably won't work! But be sure not to invalidate anyone else's emotions. That will only make them grow more intense. It's better just to acknowledge them and take them seriously.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
