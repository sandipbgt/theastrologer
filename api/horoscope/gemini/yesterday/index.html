    "horoscope": "'Spontaneous' could be your middle name -- and that's more true today than ever. Your spirits are high and you're feeling rambunctious. You aren't just ready for excitement, you're actively courting it. Advising you to stay out of trouble is probably pointless! So just have a good time with this influence. At least you're quick on your feet. That mental agility helps you step quickly out of sticky situations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
