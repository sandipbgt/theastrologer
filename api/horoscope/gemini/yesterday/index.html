It's good to keep a sense of perspective -- this is just a passing mood -- but at the same time, if something in your life needs to be strengthened or stabilized, this is a good day for that kind of work. Focus on establishing lasting systems and structures.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
