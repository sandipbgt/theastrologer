    "horoscope": "Your natural flexibility comes into play in a wonderful way today. You flow fluidly from one social group to another. You get along well with everyone, because you understand just where each person is coming from. And you're interested in harmony with everyone you meet. It's a great day to serve as the glue that holds a group of friends or a team of coworkers together. You can inspire them to unite their efforts.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
