    "horoscope": "Your finances may experience a little upsurge today, and in general, you're feeling inspired. But don't brag! It's best to be modest about your triumphs, at least for now. After all, other people might not be feeling so successful. Try not to get so stuck in your own point of view that you ignore what they have to offer. Be awake and alert to their ideas and other contributions. Remember, their points of view are just as valid as yours. Taking their suggestions seriously could lead to important revelations.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
