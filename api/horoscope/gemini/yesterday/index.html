Maybe you're the messenger of the gods, carrying out divine work that's important to us all. Or, maybe you're just looking out for number one, pursuing your own interests with your wheeling and dealing. Either way, you win, so make it count for something good. Put your energy to use making the world at large a new and improved place to live.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
