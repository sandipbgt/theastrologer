    "horoscope": "Ugh! The current energy is heavy and constricting, and you're feeling grouchy in response. Your bad mood is understandable -- responsibilities are weighing on you, and you just want to be free of it all. But why do you resent friendly strangers? They're just trying to get along. Oh, well. Go ahead and deflect all their schemes and plans today. Maybe that will help you get used to them, so you can calm down and open up. Besides, in a few days, you'll feel much better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
