    "horoscope": "Gather up all those loose ends and pull your act together now. It'll take the right mood, but once you're feeling positive, you'll get this show on the road. Don't worry about how prepared you may or may not be. You have all the knowledge and dexterity you'll need for today, if not longer. Looking good wouldn't hurt, either. That part should be easy for you,. Your sense of self is strong and healthy enough that you can touch up your appearance without feeling vain or attention-starved. All you need is a smile.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
