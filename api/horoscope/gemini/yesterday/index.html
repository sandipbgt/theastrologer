Don't treat anyone disrespectfully now, no matter how much you think they deserve it. Losing your temper will just lead to hurt feelings. Do your best to rise above, and make peace with other people as well as with yourself. You'll feel better simply for proving to yourself that you can do this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
