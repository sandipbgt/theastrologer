    "horoscope": "You're drawn to systems and routines today. Working through a problem or following an established process actually brings you a sense of satisfaction. That's a good thing, especially if you're stuck doing mundane tasks like running errands. But try not to let the routine itself eclipse the purpose for following it -- the final outcome. Don't be afraid to take shortcuts, within reason, of course. Use your ingenuity to streamline the process.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
