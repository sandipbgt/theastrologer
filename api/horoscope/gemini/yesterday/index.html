    "horoscope": "Lively discussions develop quickly today, which you adore. You especially love it when the interaction turns into a debate. This gives you a chance to make quick mental connections, which is your strong point -- especially now, under the current influence. Your thoughts move quickly; one idea sparks another, and another. Soon, your perceptions are spreading like wildfire. What a fun, passionate way to interact with the world!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
