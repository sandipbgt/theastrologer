Oh, and about that reality: did you ever notice how being under pressure gives you strange ideas? Certain things seem impossible or justified, and not the usual things, either. Uh-oh. Better clamp down on that runaway imagination. Don't do anything rash. The consequences probably won't be worth it, especially the ones you can't predict.
