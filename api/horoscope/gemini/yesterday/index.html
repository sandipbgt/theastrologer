    "horoscope": "The energy bubbling through you feels too inspiring to waste. You're bright and eager, and you thrive in natural settings. But for today, the pace of nature could seem a little on the slow side. No problem -- you've also always been adaptable. You can settle in and wait this brief period out. And you'll have lots of fun in the meantime, especially if you focus on the positives, such as the pleasure of social connections and earthly delights. This is a great time for a party; it's also a good time to get your finances in order.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
