    "horoscope": "You're used to making impulse buys and relying on credit, but being self-indulgent about money simply won't cut it today. Pay attention to how much you spend now.

Find ways to cut  corners now so you can contribute to the long term.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
