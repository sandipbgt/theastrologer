    "horoscope": "Today is a day of unusual emotional cravings and unexpected urges. You might start thinking of something -- perhaps someone you find attractive, or someone who hurt your feelings -- and the next thing you know, you've thought of nothing else all day. This obsessive energy is affecting everyone right now. But you don't have to let it control you. If you find yourself brooding, focus on something more positive.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
