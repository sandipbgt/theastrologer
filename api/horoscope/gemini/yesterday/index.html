Whatever's going on, something has you over the moon, and you want to shout out from the rooftops. But wait a couple of days before you go announcing anything. The situation could shift, including your own feelings about it. For now, reflect on how you'll approach this new source of fun in your life. In a few more days you can let everyone know why you're so happy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
