    "horoscope": "Self-delusion has rarely been an issue for you -- you generally have a pretty good grip on reality. Still, make it a special point to keep track of things today. You need to focus on the probable future rather than looking back in nostalgia. Put your energy into making connections with others and generally keeping it real. When your chance comes to make a move, you'll be prepared with allies, wisdom, and planning on your side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
