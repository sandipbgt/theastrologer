Of course, even the sweetest one-on-one time can devolve into an argument But only if someone lets their feelings get the better of their logic. Some folks are more suspicious under the current influence. As for you, you're feeling things strongly, and you're always a master with words. Watch how you phrase things. Language is even more powerful than usual!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
