    "horoscope": "Your mood is affable and your energy is steady today. You may not be quite as spunky as usual, but that's okay. Everyone needs a little downtime sometimes, right? And the current influence is perfect for being mellow. Connect with your friends or family, and enjoy their company over a good meal. Take a midday nap or a long, leisurely walk. This is all about appreciating life in the present moment.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
