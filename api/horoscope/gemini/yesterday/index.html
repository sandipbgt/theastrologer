    "horoscope": "Welcome to an enjoyable, exciting day, one that encourages you to tap into your greatest strength -- namely, your keen intelligence. You're thinking like a scientist, developing theories based on what you see combined with what you already know. It's fun to test your ideas, too. You don't mind if they turn out to be incorrect.
