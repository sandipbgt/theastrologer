    "horoscope": "Mental dexterity is one of your strong points, and today more than ever. Puzzles are no problem for you to unravel, whether you're tackling them for work or for play. Speaking of which, you're in quite a playful mood, keeping things light with friends and coworkers. Silly, flirty exchanges, whether in person or via email or Instant Message, are a lot of fun. Just make sure they don't get in the way of getting something accomplished!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
