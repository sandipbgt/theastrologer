The good news? You're currently quick-witted and light on your feet, so you can respond to subtle social cues at a moment's notice. Plus, you're even more creative than usual, so you'll quickly turn a gaffe into a joke that pleases everyone. That's a good way to gain friends and allies.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
