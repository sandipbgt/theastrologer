    "horoscope": "It may be tough today to meet the world from your usual lighthearted perspective. People are in intense moods. You may be feeling all stirred up and turned around, yourself. It's important to be honest about your feelings, even the tough ones that are difficult to talk about. It's also important not to take your feelings, or anyone else's, too seriously! Jealousy and other upsets are blessedly fleeting. They'll pass before you know it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
