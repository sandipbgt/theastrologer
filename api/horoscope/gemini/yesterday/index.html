    "horoscope": "Your drive to freedom is full-on, and your purpose and direction can't be swayed. The only problem is, these couple of days aren't about making progress but slowing down and reflecting on the state of your life. Have you thought about what you'll leave behind, once you get where you're going? Probably not. So take this opportunity to pause in your journey and learn more about what you're missing. You might find that in your haste to reach that wide, compelling vista, you're giving up something you really value.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
