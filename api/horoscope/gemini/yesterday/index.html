    "horoscope": "Whatever you're doing today, teamwork is the way to go. Your ideas and efforts can only be enhanced by running them past someone else. Games are more fun if you get more players involved, and brainstorming sessions are more productive with more minds working together, bouncing ideas around like beach balls. Plus, your sense of humor helps keep any group laughing and in balance, staving off any potential tension.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
