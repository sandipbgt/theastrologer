    "horoscope": "You're always quick on the uptake, but especially today. Your mind is sharp and your thoughts move ahead quickly. Clever comments occur to you like tiny flashes of lightning! You might keep yourself -- and others -- laughing all day long. But keep in mind that even the wittiest of barbs is still a barb. Folks are easily irritated right now, so take measures to make sure you don't upset the wrong person.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
