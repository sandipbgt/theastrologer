You have a real taste for the bizarre and intriguing, if only because you know it'll result in a great story later on. Of course, you might actually learn something important -- something you incorporate into the rest of your life. That's why days like this are so interesting: You never know where an article or a conversation might lead.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
