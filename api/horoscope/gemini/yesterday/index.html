    "horoscope": "Your thinking is wonderfully unconventional today. By modeling your taste for the unusual, you can inspire the people around you to break outside the narrow confines of their own experiences and expectations. You're a real maverick, with diverse, even eccentric interests. Have fun pursuing strange ideas simply for their own sake. Even if this doesn't lead you anywhere specific, it's just a great day to exercise your pioneering spirit.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
