Spend some time reading, get some slow-paced exercise, or just relax in front of the TV. At work, your increased focus leads to steady output. Resist the urge to check your email every two minutes. See how long you can sustain your forward momentum on a particular task.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
