    "horoscope": "A thinker by nature, you tend to intellectualize your feelings, especially if they're particularly strong or strange. But sometimes, it's best to let your true feelings wash through you, even if they don't make any sense at all. This is one of those days,. Feel your feelings deeply. Don't judge them -- and definitely don't act on them, because they could change in a flash. Just sit with them until they pass though.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
