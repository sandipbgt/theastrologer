    "horoscope": "You're a self-contained unit today. Be satisfied with your abilities and your possibilities. Let every moment be a photo op. Maybe you're not trying to impress anyone with your superior motor skills or eye-hand coordination, but you could be mistaken for a dancer or athlete. What matters most, though, are your expectations. Don't aim too high and set yourself up for failure. If you're going into this alone, be reasonable about what you can accomplish in the coming month. And if you need a guarantee, limit the risks you take.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
