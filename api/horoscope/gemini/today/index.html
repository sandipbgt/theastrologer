    "horoscope": "You have a variety of projects going, and these diverse interests will keep you busy today. They could also dilute your strength as you dash around from one thing to another. This might make you look busy, but you won't actually accomplish much. Try to stick with each task until it's done. Center yourself in your body instead of your mind. You'll find your focus when the right time comes.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
