    "horoscope": "Be spontaneous today. Impulsive acts carry a kind of kinetic magic. Sometimes acting without thinking is pure recklessness, but now it's different. This is about grabbing opportunities as they arise. Your timing has to be perfectly on point! And if anyone can perfect their quick draw, it's you. You have a good sense of what makes a sure bet. And you can dance away from danger pretty easily, too.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
