Life itself turns mellow, and takes on the pace of a pleasant summer afternoon. Enjoy the relaxation the current influence offers. And try not to let restlessness overtake you! It's so much better to settle into a slow, steady rhythm now than to disturb everyone's peace by creating false excitement.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
