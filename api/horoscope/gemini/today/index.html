    "horoscope": "You're drawn to art and creativity today. If you're a creative type yourself, it's a wonderful day for working in the medium of your choice. It's also a good time to visit a gallery or museum, or thumb through a book of paintings. Lyrical turns of phrase please you deeply, and vivid colors speak to your soul. This is the kind of energy you live for -- this imaginative influence that turns everyone into an artist.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
