    "horoscope": "Don't be surprised if you feel a little moody today. A sense of melancholy is common now, because suddenly you're more aware of those memories or experiences that push your buttons -- sentimentalities, old emotional wounds and more. You might miss someone intensely, or feel a revived sense of hurt over something that happened long ago. Whatever comes up, process it. If you ignore it, it will just come up again later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
