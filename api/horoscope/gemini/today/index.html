    "horoscope": "You're used to being in your head and living life through your thoughts and ideas. That's why today could be tricky for you. You're feeling more emotional than usual. Your mind may be full of images and impressions, but they're abstract at best. It's hard to make sense of them. Maybe you shouldn't even try. It's okay to have a day or two of fuzzy thinking and general confusion. Your wits will sharpen again soon.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
