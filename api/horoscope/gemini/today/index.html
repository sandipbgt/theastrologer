    "horoscope": "Once you kept quiet and didn't let a single drop of classified information escape. Or maybe you gossiped nonstop, spilling everyone's beans like a walking celebrity chat site. But however you used to be, rude or polite, sincere or sarcastic, today it's the reverse. Friends wonder what's come over you. Strangers recognize something different about you but couldn't say what. This is your chance to see how the other half lives, although the change won't last. Soon you'll flip back to your previous state. You'll just have more to talk about.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
