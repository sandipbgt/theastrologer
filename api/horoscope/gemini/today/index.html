    "horoscope": "Funny, touching moments seem to abound today. Life itself seems a little more inspiring than usual. Or maybe you're just connecting at a more emotional level than you normally do -- or even softening up a bit. If so, that's a good thing. You could use a break from lighthearted, witty behavior. Sometimes, a bit of good, old-fashioned sincerity is just the thing. You'll find this is an effective approach in business dealings, too. People like working with someone both humorous and honest.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
