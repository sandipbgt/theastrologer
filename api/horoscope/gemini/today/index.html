    "horoscope": "You're ruled by audacity today -- a sense of daring that comes over you and won't let you out of its grip. It's like a voice on your shoulder, taunting you and egging you on, saying, 'Go on -- do it!' Daredevil schemes suddenly seem like a great idea. And you know what? Your sheer willingness to take a risk could carry you through just about any tight spot. So be wise, but also, be bold!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
