    "horoscope": "You might be most comfortable in an intellectual realm. But today, you're thrust into the hazy realm of emotions. Perhaps someone close to you is feeling especially loving, or maybe they're in a gloomy state of mind. Or maybe you're the one who's feeling things much more intensely than usual. Either way, don't try to joke or rationalize these feelings away. Sit with them. Absorb them. Let them wash through you like.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
