Others-oriented events should go well, whether you're in a meeting, on a social engagement or simply spending time at home with your family. It's easy to keep the laughter and conversation going. Your mind is humming with humor and bright ideas. It's a good day to pull out a crossword puzzle or a board game, since you're thinking so quickly.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
