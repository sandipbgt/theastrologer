    "horoscope": "It's difficult to make a decision today. How are you supposed to be decisive when the world looks fuzzy at best? The particulars of a situation just aren't clear to you right now. Don't try too hard to clarify them. Just wait things out. Your mind will sharpen again soon. If you have to make a decision, first consult someone you trust -- a friend or an expert who can offer you perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
