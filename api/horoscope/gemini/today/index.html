    "horoscope": "Often, your attention touches on the momentary things that catch your interest - an interesting film or article, an engaging conversation. Today, though, you're more concerned with ongoing projects and the enduring structures in your life. Put some time and attention into building up your close, long-term relationships, your finances or your career. These are the constants in your life -- the people and systems you may sometimes take for granted.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
