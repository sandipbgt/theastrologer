    "horoscope": "You're not quite as engaged as usual with the world around you. Boredom could set in quickly. Fortunately, this is a rare condition for you, though certainly an uncomfortable one. Distance yourself from that kind of suffering. You don't need it. Get closer to your real friends instead. You know who they are, and they're here because they love the real you -- even if you feel a little on the dull side.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
