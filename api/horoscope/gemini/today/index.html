    "horoscope": "Today is your day -- your best chance for exploring ideas and making plans for the near future. Infused with new intellectual energy, you're extra sharp-witted and curious. You're making mental connections that were out of reach even just a day or two ago. Capitalize on this in any way you can! But your best bet is to set a goal for the next four weeks, and work to reach it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
