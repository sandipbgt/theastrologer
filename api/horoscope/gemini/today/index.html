    "horoscope": "There probably won't be much romance in thetoday. But maybe you don't care. You're secure in a different kind of love. Maybe you're happy not to have a significant other checking in with you. Some personal developments come more easily when you're alone, when you have room to move, or when you can fall flat on your face without worrying about anyone else. All this might seem strange and self-indulgent, but it's necessary. And the next time romance finds you, you'll know why it was so important to stand alone for now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
