You might want to go through old photographs or tell stories passed down to you from your parents or grandparents. If you've been thinking of tracing your family tree, it's a great day to start digging into old genealogy records. Write everything down. Create a family history.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
