    "horoscope": "The bigger endeavors in your life are on hold for the moment, and there's a good reason. Don't try to push through on a project for work or school, or a new relationship. Instead, try to enjoy just floating along. You're ordinarily so restless -- can you handle a few days of small potatoes and interior views? Try to be patient, Gemini. If you're calm and observant, you'll learn a lot about why life sometimes imposes downtime, just when things are starting to get interesting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
