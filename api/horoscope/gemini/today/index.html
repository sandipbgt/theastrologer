    "horoscope": "You're interested in seeking new, creative ways to do things. Change engages your mind, and you're less afraid of making mistakes than you are of becoming static. This unconventional approach of yours is now attracting lots of positive attention. Everybody around you seems to want a piece of you now. It's a good thing you're outgoing enough to handle it! In fact, their interest and attention helps you switch into performance mode. Give them the show of their life.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
