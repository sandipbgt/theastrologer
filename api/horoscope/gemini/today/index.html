Why can't everyone just calm down and develop a sense of humor? You may be right about that. Being able to laugh at yourself is one of your best qualities,. But it's also okay to feel your emotions deeply. You don't always have to intellectualize everything.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
