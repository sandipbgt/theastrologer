    "horoscope": "It's a perfect day for gathering with friends for a group project, or throwing your efforts into a cause along with many other people. There's power in numbers, and that's rarely truer than it is today. Working alongside other like-minded people creates a breeding ground for innovation with built-in checks and balances. Together you can produce brilliant ideas, but make sure they stand up to the rigors of logic and practicality.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
