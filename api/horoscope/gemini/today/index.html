    "horoscope": "Verbal communication is your strength. Today, focus more on connecting at an emotional level. That's where you'll find real satisfaction. Of course, words will probably be involved! But telling someone you love or support them is even more powerful when you back it up with action. So give a friend a hug. Call a relative you haven't spoken to in a while. Offer someone encouragement, to help them through a rough patch.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
