    "horoscope": "People seem especially interesting today. Or maybe it's just that your mind is more alive now than usual. Either way, conversations flow like a fast-moving river, and laughter soon follows. Your own words and thoughts are articulate and well-formed. It's easy to slip into a kind of performance mode as you command a rapt audience. Enjoy this brief, invigorating influence! It's a lot of fun to be so intellectually attuned.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
