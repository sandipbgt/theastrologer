    "horoscope": "Today it may seem as if people are placing too much emphasis on trivial details. Does process really matter that much? The answer, at least at the moment, is that yes, it does matter. Your best bet is simply to do your best. If your employer gives you a project, don't take any shortcuts. Even creative thinking isn't the best idea now. A traditional, methodical approach is so much more favorable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
