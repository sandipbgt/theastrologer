    "horoscope": "Today offers a wonderful chance to get out of town, if you can. The current vibe is just right for easing into the rhythm of the great outdoors. If you reconnect with nature now, you'll be struck anew by the realization that you are a vital and important part of the natural world. And you'll enjoy living at nature's pace for the day. If you have to stay home, find another way to move through life more slowly and naturally. Go with the flow, and match your energy to that of the world around you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
