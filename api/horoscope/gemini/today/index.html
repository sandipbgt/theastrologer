    "horoscope": "If you're feeling disconnected today from other people, or even from your own feelings, try not to place too much importance on it. Your energy is off, but that won't last forever. Though this may be an awkward phase, remind yourself that it will improve soon. In the meantime, try not to say anything too off-color, especially in the presence of your employer or potential clients. You wouldn't want to make a bad impression just because you're feeling a little strange.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
