The current energy is all about discovery and strokes of insight. Your mind feels wonderfully full and deliciously stimulated! You may find it hard to focus on one thing at a time, but no matter. Live with your eyes and ears open. Make sense of it all later.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
