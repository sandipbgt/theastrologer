Mental flexibility is one of your strengths, so this should be enjoyable for you. Your only difficulty might be getting the big-picture perspective that's so important right now. Don't allow yourself to get caught up in minor details that don't matter in the grand scheme of things.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
