    "horoscope": "It's a great day to join forces with other people, especially a group that's focused on some sort of humanitarian cause. You're thinking along those lines, yourself. You're interested in improving the world around you, though you may not know where to start. That's where established groups come in. You don't have to start from scratch on your own. You can throw your valuable efforts behind a cause that's already underway.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
