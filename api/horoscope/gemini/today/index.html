Your broad interests help you cooperate fully, because it's not like you'd use all these advantages to thumb your nose at society. Today you'll be an easy fit wherever you go. Everyone will break out the banners and confetti to welcome you home. It doesn't matter if you've never been there before and don't know anyone. They all want to be your friend, and given what you know about yourself, how could you blame them?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
