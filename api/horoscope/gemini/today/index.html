You're in the mood for a party, so if you're stuck at work, you'll probably be the one hanging out in the break room, waiting for your coworkers to stop by! If you have no social events on your agenda, treat yourself to some fun by visiting an art gallery or museum, a botanical garden, or anyplace where you can appreciate beauty.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
