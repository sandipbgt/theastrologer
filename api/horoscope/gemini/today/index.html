    "horoscope": "Your escapist tendencies are heightened today. You rarely like being pinned down, since you're too energetic for that. But now, you just want to bypass the demands of your everyday life. The more responsibilities pile up for you, the more you'll fantasize about turning your back on all of it. So why not claim some alone time? It's a great day to keep your own company and pursue quiet, low-key activities.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
