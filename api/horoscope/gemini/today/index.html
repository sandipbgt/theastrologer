Clowning around may not be the best idea now. Especially if you're at the office or around someone you'd like to impress, you need to show them that you can get serious, too. It's just that kind of day. Hopefully tomorrow the mood will lighten up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
