    "horoscope": "Today you're full of vim and vigor, but you may not accomplish much overall. Though you have plenty of get-up-and-go, you're a bit lacking in follow-through. You might start a project full of energy and intention, but then one or two minor aspects will catch your attention... Before you know it, it's time to move on. When your focus is this scattered, time management is especially important!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
