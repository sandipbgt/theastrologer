You're trying too hard to perform to an impossibly high standard. And who set that standard? No one expects you to be perfect. If you're suffering from indecision, just pick a direction and head that way. Otherwise you'll lose a whole day of progress.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
