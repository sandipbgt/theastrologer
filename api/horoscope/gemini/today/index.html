    "horoscope": "Your personal needs and urges recede today. You're more focused now on other people than on yourself. You may find yourself offering help to a stranger at the grocery store, or engaging in other random acts of kindness. That's a very positive kind of energy to put out into the world. Keep it up! Right now, many people can use as much compassion as they can get.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
