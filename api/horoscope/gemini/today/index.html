    "horoscope": "It's a good day to get fanciful and creative. Lyrical language calls to you now, so read some poetry, or write your own. Or, simply enjoy playing with words as you talk with a friend. Language is your strong point, you know. Clever ideas come even more easily now than usual, because you're in your intellectual element. If a brilliant brain wave strikes, be sure to record it in some way!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
