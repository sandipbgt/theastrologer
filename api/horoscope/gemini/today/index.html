    "horoscope": "The needle on the energy gauge is hovering around empty. Your ambition seems to be petering out. Your disciplined routine is getting tedious. Whatever motivated you before is hiding from you now. It's okay to ask yourself what you're doing here. It's okay to question your commitments. Put that indecision to work today. This is how life-changing events begin, at least the ones over which you have any control. Don't worry about the disciplined routine just yet. Celebrate the new and exciting while it's still new and exciting.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
