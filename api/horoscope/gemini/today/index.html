    "horoscope": "You're as versatile and creative as ever, but definitely less scattered than usual, and that's a winning combination. Soon, you'll present a polished effort to the outside world. If you do it in person, everyone can shake your hand. They'll want to congratulate the clever soul who came up with such a good, ingenious product. They may even want in on your secrets -- not that you're quite ready to share them yet.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
