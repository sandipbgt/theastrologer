You tend to go in fits and starts: One project or problem might catch your attention, but then something else claims your focus, and it's off to that issue for a while -- and your original work is completely forgotten. Instead of falling into this trap of distractibility, do your best to concentrate on one thing at a time. Right now, that's the most efficient way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
