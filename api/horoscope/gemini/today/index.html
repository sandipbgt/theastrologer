Your friends and family know you well enough to know that when you're like this, they should just stand back, because you're a force of nature! Your sheer enthusiasm creates a burst of energy all its own. You might even get into trouble under this cosmic influence -- madcap, hilarious trouble that shouldn't have ill effects for anyone. Have fun with this.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
