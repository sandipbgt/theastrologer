Do make sure your jokes are appropriate, though, so you don't offend anyone. People who don't understand what's going on will quickly annoy you. Some people are just so clueless! Instead of judging them, try to meet them not just halfway, but a little more than that. They might not recognize your effort, but you will.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
