Getting together with friends or a lover is even more fun than usual, because it puts you in touch with your own best qualities. If you can work with someone on a creative project, so much the better: Whatever you're up to, savor this moment, because who knows when you'll feel this perfect again?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
