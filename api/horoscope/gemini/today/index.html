    "horoscope": "You're in a good mood, but you definitely need your space today. If you're in an intimate relationship, explain this to your sweetie! You don't want to upset them. You could accidentally offend a friend if you aren't tactful about getting what you need. Still, you're in the mood to hang out with other people, and you are a jovial, fun addition to any crowd. It's a win-win situation.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
