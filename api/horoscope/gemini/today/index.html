    "horoscope": "You're in a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, sociable mood today. If you use the current energy simply to connect with friends both old and new, that will be enjoyable enough. But you could make this influence even more productive if you tap into it with a particular goal in mind. Humanitarian efforts are particularly favored now. In fact, anything you do that's intended to improve the world in some way should go well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
