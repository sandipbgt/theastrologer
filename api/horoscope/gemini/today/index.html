    "horoscope": "Memories are elastic. You can stretch them in any direction and add new dialog until you come up with a happy ending. But instead of messing with the past, find better, braver ways to change your mood. Dangle a few rewards in front of yourself and watch those attitudes adjust. Yes, a little bit of greed might be OK if it brings you closer to some worthwhile goal, but don't lose hold of your artistic side as those ambitions flare. Creativity and personal gain are two different things. Enjoy this day of vision and action, and don't look back.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
