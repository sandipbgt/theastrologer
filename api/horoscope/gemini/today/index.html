    "horoscope": "Today, your creativity is enhanced by the cosmos. What's more, you're extra courageous, which opens plenty of paths in itself. You're willing to test out new ideas and see how they play out. You can exhibit a lot of innovation in your work, impressing a client or supervisor. All of this adds up to big, bold brain waves that have the potential to play out in some surprising ways.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
