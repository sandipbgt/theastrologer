But if you're the type to get distracted easily, you won't make as much progress as you should. The same goes for frittering time away on small details that don't matter. Keep one eye firmly on the end result -- that treasured goal -- to stay focused.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
