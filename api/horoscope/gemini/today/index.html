    "horoscope": "Your clever wit draws lots of admirers your way today. You're filled with a buzz of energy that has you one-upping yourself. Each story is funnier, wilder, more fantastical than the last! And as long as people are laughing and paying attention, you'll just keep going. Enjoy this influence. It's a great day to solidify your friendships -- and even to indulge in a little fun flirtation, if the opportunity arises.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
