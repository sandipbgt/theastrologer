    "horoscope": "Why are people whispering? Why do they look so timid whenever you're around? Maybe it's because your reputation precedes you. You're kind of a heartbreaker, you know. You have this habit of luring someone in and then changing your tune. Today, stay a little more focused on what you're singing and who's listening. You don't really want to hurt anybody. That means you should stop confusing their expectations. Yes, it's a turn-on to have this kind of power, but that's no excuse for turning others off by trampling all over their fragile little hearts. Be gentle with them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
