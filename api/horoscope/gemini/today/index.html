    "horoscope": "Your mind is abuzz today. You're open to mental stimulation, and boy, does it come your way! Ideas seem fascinating, and conversations reveal astounding opportunities. This is no time for spending the day alone. Get out and interact with people. If you're able to help others, so much the better. Your social conscience is activated, and aiding someone -- especially through your own ingenuity -- makes you feel great about yourself.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
