    "horoscope": "You know, the strangest things come out of your mouth when you're feeling uncomfortable. If you start saying things that just aren't appropriate during business meetings or tender moments with your sweetheart, make sure they know you aren't really petty or empty-headed. You're just having an off day, and soon, you'll be on again. Better yet, close your mouth and listen for a while. It'll keep you from getting into trouble, and you might learn something important.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
