    "horoscope": "You have an agile, witty mind these days. Your moves are deft and precise. This is going to matter today because you may have to pick up and follow someone else's thread. Accept the challenge without complaining. And from the moment you hit the ground running, no one will be surprised. That's because you have a reputation of learning so well from experience. See if you can extend this lucky time for another month. Try what's new instead of what you know. Make your life more interesting and rewarding whenever you can.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
