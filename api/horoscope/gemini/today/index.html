    "horoscope": "You're a talkative sort, but today, you may find that people are communicating more on nonverbal levels. This is subtle, and it takes some good listening skills -- beyond simply hearing what people say! You also have to listen for what they don't say -- essentially, reading between the lines of any conversations you have. Silence speaks volumes, too. It's a good day to hone your skills on this level.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
