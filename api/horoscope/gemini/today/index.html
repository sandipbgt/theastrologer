    "horoscope": "Your creative, offbeat nature shines today. You'll enliven any group and challenge anyone whose thinking is more narrow or traditional than yours. That means some people may not get your point, but at least you'll make them think. Maybe soon they'll realize you were right all along. Until then, keep doing what you're doing, and stay positive. It's not always easy to go it alone, but that may be your path, at least for the present.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
