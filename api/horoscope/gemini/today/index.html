    "horoscope": "Today you'll be quick to scold and slow to apologize, which won't make you a favorite among others. It would be a lot better for everyone if you'd just admit that you're feeling inadequate. It's elementary but true: Your own insecurities lead you to criticize everyone else. You're operating under an unreasonable expectation of perfection. It's time to break this this habit and accept the flaws of yourself and others.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
