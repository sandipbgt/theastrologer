This could end up getting you into trouble if you aren't careful. Don't annoy your employer by giggling and whispering during a business meeting, and don't put off a potential new friend by never letting them get a word in edgewise. Keep your mouth open and closed an equal amount of time.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
