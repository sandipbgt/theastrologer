    "horoscope": "Normally you enjoy a bit of excitement. It adds spice to your life. Today, things feel too chaotic. Passive types easily will feel lost in the hustle and bustle. This includes you. Maybe it's time to step back from the crowd. Quiet and solitude aren't usually your thing, but for now, they feel right. This is a great time to go your own way, if you can find it. If you can grab a close friend on your way out, so much the better. That way, you can self-indulge together and enjoy life's slower rhythms.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
