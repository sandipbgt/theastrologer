Instead of letting the unusual conditions today bother you, you'll thrive under them. Just be sure to stay witty, and keep an open schedule. Anything could come up -- an impromptu road trip, an exciting invitation from a friend, even a brand-new, engaging acquaintance -- and you want to be ready for it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
