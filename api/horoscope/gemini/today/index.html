    "horoscope": "Usually you're full of a million different, great ideas for colleagues at work or with your friends, but table those urges today. This is a quiet time, a period for you to float along instead of pushing ahead. Let other people get on with their own initiatives and capers. Wish them well now. You may rejoin them, but today you're more in the mood for restful activities like reading, talking on the phone with long-distance friends or taking a long nature walk.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
