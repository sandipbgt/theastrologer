Hey, if you can get your colleagues laughing at a dreary business meeting, that's just points in your favor! And at a party, you're sure to draw the admiration of someone special, if that's what you want. Support of all types is headed your way, so take advantage.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
