    "horoscope": "There's a strong emphasis today on compassion. You might need a little extra understanding from others, yourself. If you're feeling a little off center emotionally, there's a good chance other people are, too. That's the current cosmic influence at work, making everyone feel things a little more deeply. Reason and logic recede as pure emotion takes over. Be kind to yourself and others until this influence passes!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
