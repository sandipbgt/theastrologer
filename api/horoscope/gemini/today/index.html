You're looking everywhere and you can't stop, even if you don't know what you're seeking or why. Today, you're just one big worrywart. This kind of tension isn't good for you. Concrete proof would be nice, but don't wait for it to turn up. There must be something else you can do to take your mind off your troubles. If you could forget for long enough, maybe you could leave this whole thing unresolved and just move on. It's worth considering.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
