If you're spreading yourself too thin, consider getting help. Make a list of the things you need assistance with, and then keep your eyes open. Someone may cross your path who meets your needs. Be ready to approach them with a sensible offer when they come along.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
