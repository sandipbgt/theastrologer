This question might come up several times as the day proceeds, because the whole world seems to be moving at a slow, careful pace. But sometimes it's good to take a measured approach to life,. It helps you focus on the important elements of a project and devise practical solutions to problems. Embrace this value now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
