Try hard not to make an issue of yourself or draw others' disapproval, especially at work. Instead, focus on ways you can be part of the solution. Soothe and distract yourself with information gathering or another task you're good at and can enjoy. That way, you won't give anyone reason to complain about your behavior or performance or your contribution to the greater good.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
