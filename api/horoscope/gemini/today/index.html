Maybe an old friend calls or sends you an email. Or maybe a dream you had last night reminded you of something you'd forgotten. You might be lost in thought today, and that's not a bad thing. Sometimes it's nice to slow down and gain some perspective.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
