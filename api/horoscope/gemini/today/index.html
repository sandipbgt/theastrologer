    "horoscope": "Today's influence emphasizes the importance of deep concentration and hard work. The very idea of that may make you groan! But there's a time and a place for everything. Right now, it's time to focus and take care of business. Apply yourself to a project at work, even if it's tedious. Live up to your responsibilities at home, even if you would rather duck them. Prove to yourself and others that you're reliable.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
