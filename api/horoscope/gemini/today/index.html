    "horoscope": "You're distracted again today, but that's no excuse to toss off your responsibilities. You can't just goof around the whole day! Think of this brief period as an exercise in learning to meditate. And if that doesn't help you get anything accomplished, try setting a timer for a short, manageable period of time -- say, thirty minutes. Work until the timer goes off, take a short break, and then set it again.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
