    "horoscope": "It's an intense day for everyone, and emotions are flying around you like Ping-Pong balls. You might feel like the eye of the storm -- the lone sane person in a room full of crazies. In moments like this, it's important to draw on your famous sense of humor. Find the joke in any emotional scene you happen to witness or stumble into. See if you can get other people laughing, as well.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
