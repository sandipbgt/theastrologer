    "horoscope": "Stay grounded today. Steady progress is more important now than dithering over ideas and options. That's because the tangible world -- what you can see and touch, or what's happening in the here and now -- is emphasized over the world of the mind, where you tend to spend most of your time. So join the rest of the world in the realm of reality. Focus for a while on doing some good, hard work.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
