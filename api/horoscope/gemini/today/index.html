    "horoscope": "Today, you're the life of the party -- even if there is no party! You can enliven any group, simply with your high energy and quick wit. In fact, you may claim the spotlight in some way. If you have to give a presentation at work or even perform on stage, you'll do wonderfully. Stage fright won't even be an issue. When all eyes are on you, you'll simply shine, naturally and easily.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
