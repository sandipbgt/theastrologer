    "horoscope": "Your feelings are stirred up today. You may not be used to living life on such a subjective level. Normally you're more rational than this, and it's easier to laugh at your own foibles and at others'. But now you're sensitive, which prompts you to react -- and perhaps overreact -- when someone hurts your feelings. You need your sense of humor more than ever! Instead of getting upset, laugh it off.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
