Dwelling in thoughts of people or times long gone could make you uncomfortable, but don't fight these feelings, and don't ignore them. If they come up, it's because there's something that you need to process. Be bold in facing your personal demons. You'll probably find they aren't nearly as scary as you thought they were.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
