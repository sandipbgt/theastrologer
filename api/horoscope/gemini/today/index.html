    "horoscope": "It's important to take life seriously today. Of course, being serious isn't really your nature. In fact, 'serious' may not even be in your vocabulary! But if that's the case, you'll simply have to stretch yourself. If you crack a joke at a business meeting, don't be surprised if no one laughs! People appreciate a sober attitude from you right now, no matter how much you might wish they'd lighten up.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
