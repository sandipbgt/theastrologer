Business meetings go wonderfully, because your high spirits are infectious, and your bright, brilliant mind is impressive to everyone who sees you in action. Just be careful in how you speak to higher-ups and VIPs. Treat them with respect, especially when you're feeling a little sassy.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
