    "horoscope": "This is the kind of day when a big meal leaves you feeling satisfied down to your toes, or small acts of generosity bring you a glow of inner pride. This is all about simple pleasures -- ones you may not normally notice or indulge in. It's just pleasant to share life's bounty with other people, whether by breaking bread with them or extending a kindness to someone who could use it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
