Dive into the breach with grace and confidence. If anyone emerges as the winner, it will be you. Of course, you might have to settle for a partial victory, but that's okay. If you have fun with the back-and-forth, it won't be a complete waste of time. Just make sure you're being respectful if your run-ins involve higher-ups.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
