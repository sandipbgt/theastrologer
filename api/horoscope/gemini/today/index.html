    "horoscope": "You may notice plenty of melodrama developing around you today. Many people are feeling their emotions more intensely than usual, which can lead to displays of feeling that are similarly intense -- or even comical! Of course, seeing the humor in life is just one of your natural skills. Do your best not to let on if you think someone is being overly dramatic. Support them, even if you think they're acting silly!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
