People need to know they can depend on you now -- and it's important to prove to yourself that you can rise to the occasion, too. It's a great day for making practical plans or provisions for your future. If your work or budget needs some attention, take care of business now.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
