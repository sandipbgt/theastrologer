    "horoscope": "Life slows its pace today. The people around you are in mellow moods. You're a little more relaxed than usual, yourself. Of course, that might make you restless! But rather than making waves purely to rock the boat, why not just enjoy the downtime? You're naturally good-humored. The current influence only adds to that warmhearted vibe. Accept it and absorb it. Life will get interesting again soon, don't worry.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
