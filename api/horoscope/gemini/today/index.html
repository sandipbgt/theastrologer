    "horoscope": "You can be a little too susceptible to the lure of living in the moment. Sometimes you need to think ahead. Today's quick fix might be tomorrow's slow pain. Don't make it worse by kicking yourself because you didn't see it coming. Visionaries should look into the near future for a glimpse of their so-called good idea once they're actually committed to it. Don't upset the apple cart when your hands are already too full to juggle all those falling apples. Keep this in the realm of what-if so that you can still laugh at it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
