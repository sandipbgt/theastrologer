    "horoscope": "It's a great day for teamwork. Gather with other people to make something exciting happen. You may not be the leader of the pack, but you're perfectly willing to brainstorm ideas and carry them out in a cooperative way. In fact, you can be instrumental in keeping the team together if someone else isn't feeling so adaptable. With your charm and wit, you can tease anyone back into a good mood!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
