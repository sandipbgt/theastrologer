Your own haphazard planning and execution are making you more tense. There's no reason to whine. Everyone has off days. You know you can do better. You'll soon regain your usual sense of clarity and can-do energy. Your colleagues or employer will be more impressed if you admit your shortcomings instead of taking out your frustrations on them.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
