This promises to be a passionate, emotional day for most people, including you. It's the perfect opportunity to practice feeling things without trying to make sense of them or explain them away. And if your sweetheart or a friend seems upset or extra loving, just hear them out.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
