    "horoscope": "If there's a lot on your to-do list today, don't worry -- and don't give in to the urge to blow it all off. This is your day to multitask, even if you feel spread a little thin. Besides, you have the energy to take care of everything on your list and more. Remember that it's OK to express your loyalty to more than one cause, group, or interest. You don't have to pick just one.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
