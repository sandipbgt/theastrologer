    "horoscope": "When you're discussing your views today, be emphatic, not a bore. Do what you can to keep the discussion light, because now's the time for fun and flirtation, not heated or heavy confrontations. You may even be better off simply creating something from the heart. Your instincts are true today, so follow them. Put brush to canvas, pen to paper, or fingers to strings, or connect in a nonverbal way with a certain attractive someone.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
