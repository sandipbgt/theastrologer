    "horoscope": "People around you seem old-fashioned today, and that annoys you. You appreciate fresh energy and new approaches. But today, a traditional approach isn't a bad idea. Tried-and-true methods are a good way to get the job done. Whatever you're up to today, keep caution and security in mind. Try not to spend too much money or take unnecessary risks. Life will get more fun in a day or two.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
