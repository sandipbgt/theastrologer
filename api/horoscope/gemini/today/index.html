    "horoscope": "Feelings you didn't know you had are stirred up today. At least any emotional disturbances won't last long, and while they're here, you may find them interesting. Write down your thoughts and perceptions in your journal, so you can reread them later. If you're creatively inclined, you could make a collage that taps into your subconscious mind. Just don't give in to a morose mood. Moping around is so not your style.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
