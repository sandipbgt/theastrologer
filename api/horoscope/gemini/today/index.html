In your eyes, the possibilities are abundant, but you may not get a whole lot of outside support just yet. If that's the case, just go your own way for now. Others will come to see this is a worthy cause. Soon, you'll have plenty of support and assistance, and it will become a team effort.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com",
