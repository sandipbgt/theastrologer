The good news is, most of your impulses are right-on. If what you're working on is important in a long-term way, pair your energy with research or planning. But do enjoy yourself. Getting an instant reaction makes everything worthwhile, plus it enables you to make your next move.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
