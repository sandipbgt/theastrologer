You can gift them with tall tales that inspire uproarious laughter, or with something more tangible. Either way is good. Showering someone with charm and affection makes them feel extra special. Tangible items are just the cherry on top of the cake!(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"
